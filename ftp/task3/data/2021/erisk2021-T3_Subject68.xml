<TEXT> Thats quite interesting.

Use of languige and especially the use of negative language or words with negative connotations were present in my daily use when I was severely depressed.

When I started paying attention to it and told myself to use neutral and/or positive words it also changed my own perspective on certain situations.

While I cannot say that changing the words I used, changed my situation for the better or not, I do recognise from my own experience that my use of words changed as I went from severely depressed, to depressed and to stable.

So am really interested to see the results of your research because I feel that it can have a lot of merit. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only bring updates to a couple of races. So even if you build parts every chance you get, dont put them on the car right away but wait until race x to put them on the car.

When I win a championship due to penalties to opponent team (had this with endurance B class, championship wasnt a reality due to a dnf, then championship team got a penalty due to illegal part in last race, double points, that gave me the constructors with 1 or 2 points). I stay in that championship instead of taking the promotion, citing controversial media reports and whatnot and just to "show" the team can take the championship on merit instead of technicality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can guarantee you that that is not normal. And that coping with it through drugs aint gonna solve it. A buddy of mine has been drinking heavily for the past 10 years due to anxiety...

The thing with either solution is that the longer you use it, the more unbearable sobriety becomes, prompting more useage. Thus becoming an addiction.

So no, I dont buy the "anxiety is the only bad thing". Theres plenty going on that you havent seen because of the adderal and weed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is primarily because western societies, and especially society in the US see being loud and talkative as being confident.

Studies have shown that people would often follow someone who talks a lot and is confident in what s/he says even if s/he is completely and utterly wrong.

Theres a book written by Susain Cain; Quiet. That looks at the differences between introvert and extrovert and how society, particularly US society (she's based in the US) views both extremities and how they are perceived in high school but also college and work environments.

Its an interesting read that can be a bit chewy but does paint an interesting picture in how it "works". </TEXT>

Even if you 2 were dating it was still not any of their business. They didnt communicate their bother with you 2 clearly and then threw a tamper tantrum over 2 people possibly getting into a relationship, 2 people whose business they shouldnt interfere in at all.

Offcourse both of you are shook up when "adults" start berating and harassing you for a friendship that is developed that they think is romantic but as I said, even if it was romantic; ITS NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS.

I hope you both have calmed down from it since then because it just baffles me why they blew up over it in the first place and thank the guy that stood up for you. And please, hold on to a friendship like that. I can tell you from experience that losing a friendship like that can be devestating.

I really hope you know that nothing of it was your fault, even if they have made it seem like it was. It is fully on those two.

Take care! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I never said that the current mental health systems, in any country, were perfect. But to put the blame on the people that work there alone isn't right either. A lot of them really want to help people but can't either due to rules and regulations put forward by the company, insurance company or even the government.

Mental health waitlists here are 9-12 months, not because those that work in mental health don't want to help someone earlier, but because there's not enough people working in mental health, because each year the money gets tighter and tighter.

Then there's the insurance companies telling them that therapies can not last longer than x weeks or x months, even if someone may need more time.

The reason I'm saying this is because it's too easy to put the blame on the people that you meet when looking for mental health professionals and even though they do sincerely want to help you, their hands may be tight behind their back due to rules and regulations that they don't discuss with you.

And then offcourse you have cunts that work there, thats unavoidable but majority of people I have met that work in mental health do sincerely want to help others but are simply held back by rules and regulations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> CBT isnt an awful lot. Its a simple diagram that you can use to dissect a situation. I had it aswell but I already applied it myself.

The basics are that you have had a situation. This situation elicits a feeling, a thought and a response.

For instance, the neighbours dog is barking.
So your feeling could be; I am annoyed
Your thought could be; I want to kick the dog so it shuts up.
The response could be; punching a wall because kicking a dog is not right.

Then you look at how you can look at it differently.
So same situation; neighbours dog is barking.
Feeling is annoyed.
Your first thought could be the same, but by adding a second thought; maybe it feels lonely because the neighbour left half an hour ago.
Does this change your feeling of annoyance? Maybe it does, maybe it doesnt.
What is your new response if there is one.

And basically using that approach (allbeit simplisticly explained on my end) on different situations you can change your approach to them.

If you feel it is useful to you, then you should tell your  therapist that even if s/he doesnt think it'll help, that you want to try it. In the end, therapy is abouy that. Trying out what helps or doesnt help. Some people get far with CBT, others require EMDR for example, some are helped by medication.

So if your therapist isnt open to it then s/he is preventing you from improving.

I know that in Scotland there is an organisation that focus on recovery, perhaps if you're in or near Scotland, you could get some help from them. </TEXT>

The GP should always refer you to those that can give you a diagnose, whether that is mental or physical and even if s/he doesn't want to. You can contact those people yourself regardless of whether or not your GP wants to do that.

There are conditions that are similar (ASS and schizotypical personality for example) whose treatment vastly differ and can only be seen through testing.

Trying to fix yourself without the knowledge on a condition while thinking you have said condition is only going to make things worse. You'd have better chance fixing it without putting the self-diagnose on yourself. </TEXT>

Last session they had a choice; follow 2 people or follow 4 people. They opted to follow the 4 and encountered a goblin-hobgoblin-orc patrol (they didnt stealth, so were easy to find by it) that alerted a nearby watchtower so they bolted after some combat.

I try not to get too much combat in there if it doesnt make any sense. Can take a long time but at the same time, depending on where they are, it can be possible to avoid it aswell.

<TEXT> You know whats the worst punishment is? Routing enemy units that then get a full minute of being unbreakable upon returning.

So unless you shatter a unit from the first moment of routing, it will come back and keep figting you despite having no morale.

Oh, and the fact the sea does fuck all and is no massive obstacle that has to be overcome. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As title says. Have seen broken units continue to fight even though the morale bar is empty and unit card says broken.

The result is a unit practically unbreakable that fights till the last person is dead.

I've seen it happen in Warhammer 2 in multiple army battles when army loss penalty is given before all enemy units have entered the battlefield.

In the Troy bug it seems to be unitz coming back from routing and immediately being routed again. </TEXT>

So meet Sardoni Racing. A racing company based in Sardinia racing in 3 categories; Singleseater, GT and Endurance. In the 9 seasons Sardoni Racing (2016-2024) has been active, the following achievements have been made; a total of 7 constructors titles; 102 podiums; 54 wins across all series.

The Sardoni Endurance Racing Team is the most succesfull of the teams racing under the Sardoni name, having achieved 4 constructors and drivers championships with 64 podiums and 36 wins.

* 2016; First podium
* 2017; 5 podiums, 1 win
* 2018; International Endurance Cup B-class Constructors Champion; 10 podiums, 4 wins \[Championship won after opponent team penalised in last race\]
* 2019; International Endurance Cup B-Class Constructors Champion; 8 podiums, 6 wins + promotion to A class
* 2020; First season in A-class, 5 podiums
* 2021; 8 podiums, 3 wins

<TEXT> Be me, trying Troy (very hard campaign/normal battle (fuck battle buffs).

* Rage against the Patriarchy and burn things down
* Patriarchy fights back :O
* Get rekt by a quadrillion stacks
* Try again

Second run goes better

* Rage against patriarchy and burn things down (little less)
* Patriarchy still fights back :O How dare they!
* Been issued a challenge by some Chad named Achilles
* Tells me he will burn down all my undefended settlements
* Looks at my camps...
* More Patriarchy that fights back :O

So been playing some Amazon horde but at some point in the campaign it just devolves in endless war declarations to the point I'm at war with like....20-25 factions (steadfast reliability, str rank 4 or 5) and no way to peace out with any of them.

The inability to reinforce makes it difficult to build new armies because you can only protect them, feasibly, against a single army using the ambush stance. At the moment I do have 4 armies but 3 of those have been build in the last 10 turns so they're still on the basic tier troops.

It's also rubbish that you lose all build buildings when you disband an army to avoid losing an army or to keep yourself from going bankrupt. Surely CA should know by now that this has been one of the major complaints about horde factions in previous games, most notably WH2. It takes 40-50 turns to build up the horde buildings, which is significantly higher than a settlement that can be boosted up with growth from the entire province. So the penalty of losing it all just makes no sense. Perhaps an x-turn cooldown on the use of the buildings would suit better.

Diplomacy, non-existant. Like I said, 20-25 factions, majority I have never encountered, declare war just for the sake of declaring war.

Resettling, this has also been a massive point of discussion. The moment you blow up a settlement there's a dozen armies that immediately get drawn to the settlement, just increasing the likelyhood that said faction is gonna declare war on you the moment they've settled, because you're in their land. Plenty of suggestions have been brought forward in regards to how to slow it down.

AI-anti player. Is again, a massive thing. Why does Agamemnon feels free to stop getting his wife back in favour of getting beaten up by me? Makes no sense. My Amazon buddies were doing fine, until I decided that would be the safest area on the map, Oh how I was wrong. Within 10 turns their entire faction collapsed because of all the AI armies homing in on me, somehow they've survived but severely weakened. They were str rank 1 at some point....

Agent spam....Seriously, why is this still a thing? I thought Rome 2 feedback was already enough in that regard and I'm glad that Warhammer 2, while still having agents, doesn't feel like an agent spam. But this....Fucking hell...At some point I couldn't even see the name of a settlement because of the amount of agents surrounding it. And sure, yeah, you can't get a ton of agents but when there's 50-100 factions (I dunno how many Troy has but seems to be around the number of WH2) on the map with all their 2-3 agents, it's a spam, really quickly, which primarily isn't helped by the fact only 1 agent can join an army (for sofar I've tried, I assume its the Rome 2 system) and thus you end up with majority of agents spamming their shit all over the place.

All in all, I am so glad that Nexus Mods has a couple of mods on there because while I wouldn't have mind playing a vanilla game, the sheer amount of rubbish, like great power. Why is a faction, stronger than me, concerned that I'm a "great" power thats arguably "weaker" than them? Sure, the devs want to prevent blobbing and what not...But they really ought to come up with new ways instead of flat debuffs to everything they wanna achieve with the diplomacy.

Don't give diplomacy options if you're just gonna take away all the diplomacy options with a debuff the player can't do anything against other than getting weaker....

<TEXT> You have to let go of it.

The more you want something, the more its gonna slip away from you. Theres a lesson in all this that you fail to realise.

Yes, being single sucks. No, its not the end of the world. I havent had a relationship in my lif because I wasnt interested in people during high school during college I did get interested in the girls around me but in my 2nd and 3rd year I got severely depressed (2011/2012)

Due to the depression I closed myself off from others and my mind was telling me that I was never gonna get close to a girl again (there were a couple of girls that showe mutual interest during college but circumstances never went more than kissing). The first couple of years I struggled with that, told myself that every girl I met was the girl to have a relationship with.

It exhausted me to no end and I just told myself to stop doing that. I started working on myself, my emotions, mental health, improved my social skills and in 2018 I was at a higher skill level than I was pre-depression.

I started building social networks again, found a group to play dnd, volunteer work at scouting and just have that social life again which I didn have for 6 grueling years.

For the last couple of months, I am noticing my libido is growing, I am noticing my interest in women is growig again and I have met some women that peaked my interest.

During my depression I could never have imagined this happening. It was just me never meeting anyond again. But I told those thoughts to shut up, piss off and kept improving myself.

If you cant stand being single, perhaps you need to learn how to be alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You gain more creative opportunity from stepping away from real life teams.

The current series are already solid;; ERS, ASPC, WMC, GT and Endurance.

My focus would be on having the GT and Endurance field in one go with 40 cars on track. While adding new series like nascar, rally, DTM and single make series like the Porsche cup and such.

A career mode that allows all series to be raced with in the same save file.

So you can start with single seater and then setup a GT team after money allows it and so forth. While racing both teams under your name and expand your racing repertoire like HAAS or Alpine, Marussia and so forth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They should remove it entirely and allow all customizable options be in the game from the get go.

All the time and money spend on the battlepass should be directed to balancing the field, improving the tracks (Hungaroring dip doesnt exist nor does the Suzuka bump exist) and improving the handling.

They laserscanned Zandvoort. Great shit, now the rest of the calendar. And before you go "its expensive q.q" no it isnt. They make plenty of money, with a larger target audience than games like AC/C, iRacing that do have laser scanned tracks.

Battlepasses do NOT increase the quality of any game. It takes away from the quality of the game. </TEXT>

I was excited about JWE when it was announced and the longer it was in its development cycle (launch, patches, dlc's) the more I lost said excitement and became quite annoyed with the game and lack of proper updates and gameplay.

So yeah, I dont expect their F1 game to be any different, especially given the fact that unlike with JWE they had experience with Planet Coaster, and now they dont have any relevant experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have made a good decision, even if it may not seem like it at times.

When I was in college I was having issues with depression. When I could focus on college I would get my grades perfectly but for half the year I could not do anything and even had a severe breakdown during in the wintermonths.

At the end of that year I had to make a choice. I had failed that year and had 2 choices; fix my shit or find a new study that I could do.

I chose to fix my shit, thinking I'd be done in a year and then head back to college to continue it. Oh God how I was wrong. I sunk further in depression because I had no friends, nothing to do all day and had to spend the next 6 years to get myself back up to a level of confidence and social skill that, I think was higher than pre-depression.

Allthough not having worked throughout that period and never finished college I am still lacking confidence in finding a job that would suit me. </TEXT>

The game picks the 2 best parts per category to transfer over to next season as base part. So if you can make 50 strength, legal, engine and an 80 strength, risky, engine. The 80 str engine will be your base for next season to develop further on.

2 AI teams develop their HQ and car like you do. However, being AI they dont necessarily do a good job on it. You will always outdevelop the AI over the course of a season.

<TEXT> Dude.

Here's some sciencie for your face to take in.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5639963/

As the widespread availability of highly calorific food has resulted in a high incidence of obesity, **attempts to decrease body weight have concentrated on trying to reduce energy intake. It is suggested that this is not the best approach.** Although consuming more calories than expended is part of the initial problem, it does not follow that **reducing intake, unless consciously counting calories, is the best solution.** Mechanisms smooth out the large day-to-day differences in energy consumption, decreasing the importance of the size of a meal. **In the short term a reduction in energy intake is counteracted by mechanisms that reduce metabolic rate and increase calorie intake, ensuring the regaining of lost weight.** For example, even a year after dieting, hormonal mechanisms that stimulate appetite are raised. Over a million calories are consumed a year yet weight changes to only a small extent; there must be mechanisms that balance energy intake and expenditure. As obesity reflects only a small malfunctioning of these mechanisms, there is a need to understand the control of energy balance and how to prevent the regaining of weight after it has been lost. **By itself, decreasing calorie intake will have a limited short-term influence.** </TEXT>

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0899900714004237

Highlights
•    Prospective studies have found that individuals following a vegan diet have low body mass index.

•    This randomized trial examined changes in body weight among individuals on one of five plant-based diets.

•    This study found that vegan diets were more effective for weight loss than other diets.

•    This study found that vegan diets improved macronutrients more than other diets.

and here's another study that disagrees with you.

https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/biological-factors-weight-loss-methods

The low-carb diet group was encouraged to reduce intake of grains, cereals, beans, fruits, and other carbohydrate-rich food. The low-fat diet group was told to reduce fatty meats, cooking oil, whole-fat dairy, and other fatty foods. Both groups were asked to eat more vegetables; choose whole foods; and avoid added sugar, refined flour, and unhealthy trans fats. Neither group was given instruction about setting a specific calorie restriction goal. All participants were also encouraged to follow current physical activity recommendations. The results were published on February 20, 2018, in JAMA.

The team found that there was no significant difference in weight loss between the two groups one year later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh ok. So to make 1200 calories. All i need is 1 and a half pizza a day.

This meets most calorie targets I often see on here but I guarantee you that isnt going to make me any healthier.

Theres more to food than just calories and to reduce it to just calories is more than just "self betrayal". Its outright dangerous.

You dont come across as someone who has any knowledge on the body and the nutrition of food so stop holy grailing the calories. Getting the calories is easy, just eat nothing all day except some junk food in the evening. Getting properly nutrtioned food that your body can use to break down fatty tissue? Not so easy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unless you're a certified dietician or nutritionist I'd sincerely advice you to refrain from making these statements.

What works for you does not automatically work for someone else. Each body works differently, some people have a high metabolism, others have a slow metabolism alongside various others conditions, illnesses, medications, activity level, genetics that can cause a whole different outcome in weightloss.

Posts like these could result in anorexic or bulemic behaviour in teenagers should they take it too heart before seeing a professional on the matter. </TEXT>

Microtransactions and battlepass shit do not belong in full fledged 60€ games regardless of the impact on gameplay. So no, what CM is doing is not okay and the prime reason for me not to buy the game in the first place.

Dont go crying when next year CM introduces the FIFA cards because you're allowing them to push this shit through now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The helmet was worn by Turin Turambar during the First Age. Turin was the son of Hurin, a man captured during the Nirnaeth Arnoediad and cursed by Melkor to see and hear all that Melkor saw.

Turin Turambar killed Glaurung the Deceiver (to whom Smaug was a very good bloke) but also killed his best friend ( an elf ) in a frenzy while indirectly causing the destruction of Nargothrond ( Noldorin settlement ) because he told them not to hide anymore.

Turin Turambar was a mighty warrior but hubris brought him down. Definately not a happy end tale from Tolkien but imo, the best story from Middle-Earth.

The book is Children of Hurin or Narn i Hin Hurin if you're interested. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd to eat something in the morning. It can be something light like a melon just in order to avoid stomach acid and to already start up the process of digestion (this alone costs a lot of energy).

The main question would be, do you have a hunger feeling throughout the day or not? If you dont, you might be eating at your energy level and thus remain stable.

That said, for the best advice I'd suggest looking up a dietician because s/he'll be able to give you the proper directions that cant be given through reddit and also adjust when needed.

You're still in puberty so hormonal changes can cause a lot of weight loss/gain even outside all your efforts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its not just calories though. You can stay under your required calories and still eat junkfood all week which isnt going to make you any healthier.

Next to that theres a difference in having a mobile lifestyle or one where you sit on your ass for majority of the day. The first one will have you lose weight quickly when your intake is lower, the second one not so much because your required intake is much lower.

Its too easy to just say, its calories only. Human bodies are much more complex than that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thats more like being on rails, but what if there's a car preventing you to be on said rails? Going down the inside of a corner you may need to brake sooner or fail to make it, you may need to take it tighter and you most definately need to make it slower.

I don't think the racing line reacts to that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My curiousity is there because I see a lot of people playing with a racing line on even when they're considered fast.

I'd say the Civic is more difficult because the car isnt high on downforce, so you'd need to brake sooner, carry less speed in the corner, even take the corner differently because of the handling.

I dont play racing games that often, I also play racing games in cockpit cam, so I wouldnt even see a lot from a racing line and my worst bit is primarily set up, and the fact I just hate certain tracks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What I found, during an online race in a different game, (I'm still terribly slow at the back) is that if your braking zone is consistent, your entry speed is consistent aswell.

I've learned to look at points on the track to know when to brake. Like the start of a kerb, or the orange fence in Bahrain between t12 and t13, a gap in the grass. An ad board or a bridge like Canada after first drs zone.

I feel like those little points, are more consistent than a racing line because you can run more speed into a corner than what the racing line says. But depending on your camera position, you may need different reference points. </TEXT>

Whats the difficulty? Braking? Turning? Turn in speed? Exit speed?

I've never understood why so many, even on high AI difficulties for which I'm too slow for, need the racing line in corners.

<TEXT> I started going to a dietician in 2017 to eat healthier and at the time I weighed 97kgs and kept going up to 102 and just bouncing back and forth between that.

Since corona measures got eased and pools an gyms reopened I weighed at some moments and saw 99 and 101kg.

Then last saturday after a couple of weeks of not weighing the scales at the gym (dont have any at home) said 95,5kg. So I thought this was a fluke and weighed before exercising today and saw 94,4kg which means that I've am the lowest weight since I first weighed at the dietician in 2017.

Which is a dam relief to me because it shows me that me working out twice a week and swimming once a week is not only showing progress in how well I am doing the exercise but also that it is yielding result!

I'm not there yet but it does give me hope. I was actually confused yesterday because I couldnt find my manboobs XD.

But yeah, I'm actually really happy with this and hoping that I can hit my target of 80-85.

In 2011 I weighed 72kg (I'm 1m70) but at that time I did not do any form of exercise, I just walked to school from trainstation and rode the bike to the trainstation, if I didnt pick the bus at the time.

So I dont think 70-75 is feasible. I gain muscle easily but I would have to lose muscle to do that further. The pre-corona fat tissue was at 30% at 98kg so getting to 80-85kg would give me between 10-15% fat tissue, which is in the range of healthy.

So yeah, really looking forward to seeing the scale dip to 90 and under it :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Multiple attacks do not increase the probability of it happening. Its still 5% per attack that you roll a one. Just cuz you're rolling 3 attack rolls doesnt make it 15% to roll a 1.

But hey, do think your maths is good lol.

A 1 is considered a critical fail on an attack roll;

In the core rules, rolling a 1 or 20 on a d20 has a special rule only if you're making an attack roll or a death saving throw

Source -> lead rules designer https://www.sageadvice.eu/2016/11/20/does-a-natural-20-mean-an-automatic-success/

Its up to your dm/group if you want to use said rule or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Its just rng man. If a 1 does nothing at all but a 20 does, which both have equal chance, then theres no balance.

If you dislike it, then dont use it. My group likes it and its up to the dm whether or not its used. I have had a group that didnt use it, which was fine by me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I talked about my own experience and how that affected my perception of receiving no affection from others,  yet here you are, putting words in my mouth that I never said. Did I hit a nerve?

And no, anti-depressants dont change the way you think. It just takes the edges of your emotions so they're not as debilitating as they used to be. The main reason I did not take any medication at all was because anti-depressants can increase chances of suicide in suicidal people. So I was scared as fuck I'd off myself or get addicted to them due to having addictive personality.

No happy person is gonna be like, you know what my life needs? Depression! So yea, your life is shit in one way or another otherwise you wouldnt be depressed. Not receiving, or so you say, any affection is one way to get depressed. But to claim your life isnt shit because you are missing a vital part of human life is sticking your head in the sand.

Also it helps if you would keep your frustration out of this discussion so you can actually comprehend what I'm saying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, you sure are the only person that never has had any affection in this world.

Guess what, your depression in and of itself would give you the idea that others are not giving you affection but because you are too busy with your depression, you dont see it.

How do I know? Cuz that shit happened to me, but I was too busy moping around and proclaiming my life is shit until I actually lost those people.

Anti-depressants arent gonna change the way you think. You have to change that. And yes, I know, the brain can be an annoying fuck that throws past experiences at you as prove, so you have to go and make sure you create new experiences to counter that.

Is it easy? Fuck no, but it is required. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She isnt wrong. No one can give you that experience when you are moping around all day and though stories exist of people finding love in shitty mental situations its not smart to think it'll happen to you.

So improve yourself, get out of that depression, take some courses on social skills and assertiveness during your therapy, work on your self-esteem and confidence. Then, your chances to experience affection will be far highed than they are now.

I started with therapy in 2012 and its only the past couple of years that I have had fleeting moments of affection from others. But in order to get there, I worked my butt off to improve myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I decided to remap my buttons so that I have better access to them during a race. However, once I left the pits (did this during online practice) I was dismayed by the lack of force feedback. It had completlely disappeared as if I was using one of them arcade wheels.

I tried increasing the ffb gain and increasing the minimum ffb but after I turn either way for more than 40degrees, its gone.

Is there any way I can get my ffb back to the way it was before I remapped my buttons in a non-convoluted manner? </TEXT>

<TEXT> No they're not.

Competition would be the EGS and Steam selling the same game on the same release day.

There is no competition in the EGS using their fortnine $ to force consumers to use their store or wait a year for the game to be available somewhere else.

The reason why people shit on the EGS in favour of steam is the simple reason that as a storefront, Steam is miles better than the EGS and thus they need to resort to cheap shots like "exclusivitly deals" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Considering that there is 0 knowledge on the long term effects from mRNA vaccines, because there is none in existence, its bullshit to say that there will not be any.

And in order to find out, you need LONG TERM TESTING which take up more than a year, just like any other vaccine that is tested over a prolonged period of time before being approved for human consumption.

[][][]]]]]]][][]]]]]]]


4. There are a lot of unknowns

Because mRNA vaccines are only now beginning to be tested in humans, there are a lot of fairly basic unknowns which can only be answered through human trials. ‘What is really the current challenge, I think, is to understand whether these vaccines will really be able to mount a sufficiently protective immune response in the human and to understand, for example, which quantities of mRNA will be needed to do this,’ said Prof. Bekeredjian-Ding.

Other outstanding questions include whether the proteins that have been chosen for the vaccine are the right ones to prevent a coronavirus infection in the body, how targeted the immune response is to this particular coronavirus, how long any immunity would last, and whether it causes side-effects such as increased inflammatory responses like redness and swelling or, in the worst case, aggravates disease.

<TEXT> And you think any vaccine being bought for hundreds of billions of $ will be free of charge? You must be fucking stupid if you think that will happen. Since when has the pharmacuetical industry ever brought out a free product they can sell for more than that.

And even with the entire world working on it, you cant put 10-15 years of research, which includes LONG-TERM TESTING into less than a year.

As someone that had worked for 15 years in the pharmaceutical industry you should be knowing full stop. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This. I honestly dont see any viable vaccine arriving within the next 10 years and by then covid is a non-issue.

The very fact that vaccine producing companies have a clause in the contract absolving them from responsibility should there be unforeseen side-effects tells me enough.

Most vaccines take 10-15 years of research to make, for virusses this is even longer. So to think an unknown virus will have a less than 1 year viable and safe vaccine is just utterly ridiculous. </TEXT>

I also dont see where I say "dont be depressed" or ridicule you. I said you're blaming your looks for your lack of self-esteem and confidence, which is something that comes from within you, not from whatever you own or not.

You said you prefer the bitter truth instead of some sweet lie. Heres that bitter truth from someone who has been through a severe depression;

YOU have to fix that shit yourself. Whether you like it or not. Sulking aint gonna do a thing for you. Feeling sorry for yourself aing gonna do a thing for you.

It will suck, it will feel pointless, it will feel like an utter goddam waste of your time, but despite all of that, YOU have to put in the effort, YOU have to drag yourself out of bed, YOU have to fix your appearance because no one else is goin to do for you. Its that simple.

Does it mean you have to do it all alone? No. Help can be given if you ask for it. Opportunities can and will create themselves if you put yourself out there. But nothing will change by beating yourself down and sulking in the cornor like some emo goth kid that thinks he's the only one going through some shit.

 Newsflash, everyone has shit going on and the choice is simple: will I do something about it or do I not? That is the only decision that is important. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the past couple of weeks I have been exhausted, a lot. Yesterday night I found myself outside and saw the comet streak by, really peculiar sight if you ask me, but then it dawned on me.

For the better part of 8 years I have lived secluded, at home, held back by depression and what not. For the past month, I've been doubling down on finding a job and even had 2 interviews last week.

I am physically and mentally in good shape, emotionally not so much. I am pursueing this change of life so much at the moment that I forgot one thing. I may not have liked my life the past 8 years, but it has grown on me, it is comfortable despite the absence of many of lifes pleasures and satisfaction of basic needs like being able to confide in others, experience intimacy and romance but it was my life.

I realised that I have to allow myself to grieve the passing of that stage of life in order to continue into the next. Why grieve a bad part of my life? Simple, without it I would not be here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Surely you have colleagues?

Take the client aside and have a chat with her in regards to what she expects of this place. Also give her the feedback that you see that impacts the other clients.

She could very well be doing all those things from underlying issues that manifest themselves like that and she could be willing to change those behaviours, how difficult they may be for you to deal with.

From what you explained she sounds extremely narcissistic alongside other things or, she acts like that in order to validate herself due to low self-esteem and confidence.

The only way you're gonna find out why she is acting like that, is to talk to her. If she recognises what you say and is willing to change, make some goals. Give her the room to make those changes but also implement boundaries.

Should this be a bit much on your own to have that conversation, ask a colleague to join you but not overstep you. These are your worries that you need to express for yourself to her in order to grow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is always one thing leave out when people come up with the deaths in black people based on population. And that is the simple fact that black people, on average, commit more crime than white people and other ethnic minorities like Asians and Latinos.

Perhaps, that is a direct cause to them being killed, on average, more by police.

The cities that defunded police, like Chicago and New York saw a massive spike in criminal activities, murders and shootings.

So somehow, defunding police and having less of them around, within a criminalized society, isnt the best of options.

The police are not the fault, the criminals are not the fault. They are merely symptoms of how broken the American society is and it all stems from that myth called "The American Dream" and the ridiculous hostility Americans have against policies designed to help minorities and groups that do not have the ability to take care of their own or progress in society.

The whole idea that socialist policies designed to create equal opportunities, equal pay, equal chances of education and work prospects are likened to the devil himself is fucking stupid.

Healthcare for each and everyone? Fuck that commie crap, notwithstandig that average joe and jane need 3 jobs each to pay the fucking rent, let alone the operation joe needs cuz of his football injury that will put them 20k in debt they can never repay without getting jobs number 7 and 8.

Police brutality is merely a symptom that stems from the rampant criminal activity. Fix your fucking country at the root of the issue, not the symptoms. Its simple. If someone uses drugs, the drugs are the symptom, not the cause. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The whole outrage mentality focussed around BLM is centered around a police force that is supposedly racist towards black people.

The whole police killing is just part of American society whether or not you like it. Because its so weird that when you give military training, weapons and gear that they also start using military doctrines like shoot to kill instead of injure.

It wont be fixed unless American society goes through a change </TEXT>

<TEXT> Appearantly being a cop automatically equals being a racist and thats bad.

Not to forget that majority of people killed by police in the US are white, not black, but somehow thats ignored because that doesnt suit the whole "Black Lives Matter" argument.

If those people actually considered black lives as important, I'm confused as to why they're not setting up massive monetary funds for African people that live in dire situations that wouldn even be able to dream up the lives the black people in western countries have.

But hey, I guess not all black lives matter and just those that are "privileged" to live in the first world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> :)

I recognise a lot what you wrote in the post. 8-6 years ago I was so desperate to get a girlfriend to the point I thought every girl that spend some time on me was going to be it, putting so much pressure on someone I didnt even know, that it ruined any relationship, whether romantic or friendship, well before it started.

Then I stopped doing that and simply focussed on having talks and just getting confidence back, I was suffering from a severe depression at the time, and just spending time with people.

I tried tinder and other dating sites but that doesnt work for me. The few girls I had feelings for I already knew them for well over 2 years before they developed. I'm not a, I can fall for someone in 2 weeks-person. But that was partially what led to that desperation at the time, because I had already pushed everyone I knew away so there was no way I could develop those feelings.

The last couple of years I have been slowly building a social network again, there are single women in there but I do not have any feelings for them, then again, my aim now is to find a job, so my priorities arent aimed at getting a girlfriend.

Its really annoying at times because I do have the need to just hold someone close, to feel safe, and obvioisly also sexual release, that I, at this point, dont feel I can satisfy in a healthy manner. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue with the online thing is, lets say I have some ache in my chest and then I google what I feel and such. After an hour of googling I may have ten forms of cancer, three rare diseases and conditions and seven forms of flu and pneumonia.

Helping someone online is never going to be a subtitute for a professional that can give you a proper diagnose and can point you to the right people to help you along to recover.

I get the idea, its a good gesture and the stigma has to be adressed in order to further society. But without that professional diagnose and framework, you can do more harm than good.

Hence why experience workers in my country are working alongside therapists instead of on their own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My current plan is to go work as an experience worker in mental health and from there move into psychology.

It is a workfield that is increasingly becoming more and more wanted within the Netherlands and aimed at bridging the gap between client and therapist, primarily focussing on what worked in order to recover instead of what didnt work.

I am curious as to how you want to pursue your project and primarily what the goal of it is. Is it just sharing the experience of is it also providing people that are currently going through a depression the inspiration that yes, you too can recover based on what worked or didnt work for me, but what could and could not work for you? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Making new tech group with units </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-08-06 16:45:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I followed the paradox wiki on how to make a new tech group (shows up ingame and properly shows no units from other tech groups) but the units that I assigned to that tech group don't show up.

Do I have to assign each unit individually, as in their name \[ # Test Subject \], or is  \[ unit\_type = Testsubjects \] enough?

The technology reads as follows;

		Test Subject = {
		start\_level = 3
		start\_cost\_modifier = 0
		nation\_designer\_unit\_type = Testsubjects
	nation\_designer\_cost = {
			trigger = {
capital\_scope = {
OR = {
continent = new\_world
continent = north\_america
continent = south\_america
continent = oceania


This is the base infantry I set up

 \# Test Subject
type = infantry
unit\_type = Testsubjects

maneuver = 1
offensive\_morale = 1
defensive\_morale = 1
offensive\_fire = 1
defensive\_fire = 1
offensive\_shock = 1
defensive\_shock = 1

trigger = {
MIL 3
}

But it doesn't work and I can't really find what's preventing me from getting that unit into the game. I'm using the nation designer to bring it in. </TEXT>

I have 2 job interviews this week to work as a mental health worker with mental health experience which hopefully can be translated into a workpace alongside study next year.

Depending on the country, goin by the accent I'd say British Isles for you, there is a growing demand for people with mental health experience to bridge the gap between therapists and their clients.

If making vids like this is what you want to do, it certainly can help to look into it.

Doesnt mean my life is over. If it was I should've ended it 10 years ago.

It doesnt get better, but it does get more tolerable. In the past 2 years I've had more social contact than I had in the previous 8 years combined. I have 2 job interviews coming up next week and its finally, I hope, turning around a bit.

Work on your depression. Get that shit cleared, I know, friends would help with that but at this point you gotta do it alone.

Get through that, and you can take on the entire fucking world. It may not feel like that, but it is true.

For years I felt as if no one gave a rats ass about me, still dont feel like no one gives a rats ass about me, but every now and again, I do see people giving some form of care to me, whether they know it or not.

<TEXT> And how can you ever become the truth in Your soul if you follow others?

Spirituality isnt about grand visions or meditation or yoga or tarot or whatever tool you can think of. It is about finding and following your unique individuality within the collective.

If others make you feel bad for not conforming to their ideals, they're not worth to be around. You want to find those people that will uplift you for doing it your way, instead of tearing you down for not following them.

Atleast, that is what I would do, even if it means losing many social contacts. But that does not mean that You should do it.

<TEXT> Biggest battle I had was a 3v3 between the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Seljuks in Stainless Steel 6.4. Had to give the AI control of my reinforcing armies otherwise I'd be obliterated.

At the end of the battle I had lost 90% of my army and I could not distinguish living men from the dead that sprawled around the hills.

It was a serious bloodbath.

Despite having fought many battles afterwards theres none that come close to that one in just sheer brutality on the field after battle. </TEXT>

Hence they advised me to take the regimen I have now and shake it up after 4-6 weeks to keep the body from getting comfortable and efficient with the exercises </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why do you think the current global efforts for corona are gonna yield anything different than the global efforts in the 80's for HIV?

Even if its gonna yield more results then it still cannot take away from the time required to test, trial and peer review the results. That shit should not be rushed because it can and will lead to massive fuck ups.

And yes, while corona and HIV are different virusses, the Chinese say that there are comparisons in the way both HIV and corona circumvent the immune system with the main difference between that HIV takes over cells to reproduce whereas corona piggybacks on the cells.

Even if the make-up of the virusses aren't the same, the fact that 30-40 year old known virusses still not have a vaccine is quite disconcerting to the idea that a vaccine for a virus that has yet to be understood can be created within a year or two, despite global efforts.

Any vaccine that is gonna be released within the next 2 years will have been rushed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not. But untill someone can prove I'm wrong with actual data I can be more than correct. This phenomenom known as Schrodingers cat.

I'm not against vaccines. What I am against is a rushed vaccine with incomplete data, that isnt tested properly, pushed into trial phases and hasnt been peer reviewed before being brought to population.

Vaccine research takes up to 10-15 years for known diseases and even more so for virusses (hiv and ebola been around since the 80's and 70's without effective vaccines).

What makes you think they suddenly will be able to put 10-20years of research, testing, trialing and peer reviewing into a year or 2 with succes? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dont have to demonstrate anything. What I wrote is for everyone to see and to either agree or disagree with.

What I, personally, disagree with is this optimism a corona vaccine will be found before the whole pandemic has passed. Well known diseases have had vaccine research that took up to a decade.

Which means a new virus, that is yet to be understood by virologists, will never have a vaccine within a year or two. Which is what majority of people seem to think will happen.

Any vaccine would be made based on incomplete data and the trials and peer reviews alone would take up years before it can even be approved for national or even global distribution.

By that time the pandemic will have passed and the vast majority of people will have had the virus already making the vaccine pointless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just because someone is acclaimed or not doesnt make said person right or wrong about something. Medical journals cant differentiate between false studies and correct studies because the methodology can be faked.

With hundreds of companies riding on those billion dollar vaccine contracts and to be the first, how likely is it that in lieu of great financial gain they'll mess things up? Very likely. Wont be a first time a study is doctored to prop up a product only to be recalled 2 years (and a fuckton of money) later because the study is found false.

You're better off using your common sense and rely on your bodies immune system than on some company that sees money in this. The recovery rate has shown it is not as lethal as was made out to be and actual cases will be far higher than known cases.

I dont see a vaccine coming anytime soon knowing that it takes 10-15 years for an effective vaccine to arrive. It'll most likely pass before is released anyway. </TEXT>

So I can hardly call that a succes story...

It takes 10-15 years to find a vaccine. By that time no one will look to the corona virus anymore. To think they can feasibly and safely cut that down to a year is ridiculous.

When scientific journals admit they cant check the validity of researches anymore I'm not gonna take much stock in any research that says they cures corona.

Heard about chloroquine? You know that anti-malaria drug that works against covid one week and then doesnt do shit the next week and then two weeks later has some value but the week after not anymore?

They still dont know how the virus operates and yet expect a vaccine to come out of it? Even the head of the British vaccine team has said a cure is most likely improbable.

So if the head of said team says that, why should I take any half-baked vaccine build from half information on the virus? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been fluctuating around the 100kg-mark for a year or 2 now and its annoying to say the least. Whatever I lost in fat I gained in muscle.

I have always been called fat by my brothers, even though at the time I wasnt really, and now I have a belly that can be seen from space, atleast thats how it feels.

Have been ashamed of my bellt for a long time until I took up swimming, not proud of it either but atleast I can walk to the pool without fear of bring laughed at.

The weight I gained after 2011 was due to depression, sitting at home everyday eating take out and generally unhealthy fatty foods for a long time. Losing all that weight would allow me to give a big middle finger to my depression. I'm not that depressed anymore but the effects are still here.

It would also help my confidence more cuz my mind is like "why would a girl be with a fat fuck like me anyway..." So even if it is just to shut my mind up sbout the fat part it can do wonders for my confidence.

I already hsve in mind to go buy one of those food scales so I can be more consistent with dinner aswell. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Came across this sub earlier this evening and not sure why but I took a look at how much calories I was consuming during lunch, I always thought that to be around 500 but my count was more around 1000-1200 so starting tomorrow I will have smaller lunch since that has been most consistent across my meals.

The question I have is, how much under the TDEE do you have to be in order to notice a difference after a week or 2?

I have started 0working out since gyms opened but feel like thats just gonne bump my weight up due to muscle buildup instead of burning excess fat. I weighed at 100kg/220lb yesterday after exercise and would like to get to 80-85kg/175-185lb.

I'm 1.7m tall and weighed 70kg/155lb back in 2011 but that was without any form of exercise, so not sure if I can make that now that I do exercise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not entirely sure where you think I'm from, but winter aint harsh here. Just cuz I mentioned Putin doesn't make me Russian. As for your WW2 history. You're off by a couple of years. The Russians turned the tide with Stalingrad in 1941 and counterattacked with the Kursk offensive in 1943 well before the Allies were planning D-Day.

As for the drugs, the Brits invented Speed for their soldiers during WW1 so they could stay awake, so not entirely sure what that has anything to do with it. Churchill was extremely racist towards Indians, Irish and others of the British Empire and was very vocal about it prior to the war.

Again, not a Russian here.

The Christian Crusades were called after a plea for help from the Roman Emperor in Constantinople losing ground against the Seljuk Turks. It had nothing to do with religion at all and everything to do with fighting the coming tide bearing the crescent. The Frankish Crusaders were quite brutal in their capture of Jerusalem in contrast to the way it was later taken by Salahadin.

The US has been fermenting chaos and madness in all parts of the world. The saying is very simple; you reap what you sow. Not sure where you get the idea from that Russian citizens can't access non-Russian servers and only spread propoganda if they can. Because that sir, sounds like propoganda against the Russians to me.

Don't believe anything your media is telling you about China or Russia, because that's the same shit they use to make you believe thatdemocrats/liberals/socialists/communists/whatever is bad and the death of 'Muricah.

Just cuz the name is different, doesn't mean the message is true. Doesn't matter if that's foreign or domestic. A lot of Nazi propoganda officers ended up in the US after WW2 and they'd be proud of what they've accomplished there. </TEXT>

The Nazi's would've been defeated even without Churchill, the brunt of the work was done by the Soviets. Every historians knows that. The Americans take too much credit for their work even though they faced less than 20% of total German forces in their '44-'45 campaign. So even without Churchill the Soviets would've worn down the Germans eventually. The peace deal would've just looked differently than it has now.

Churchill was for all intents and purposes a racist man and his actions to defend Great Britain shouldn't excuse him of that.

US cops kill more white than black people yearly in the US. Why is that not important? One could ask a different question; Why has the Black community not taken the same chances that were provided to the Sino and Latin communities?

The people in the US need to face the truth, all of them. They're in it together and if they can't work it out, it'll be a mess. Crying foul about the other and screaming and shouting is not gonna solve anything. People need to shut the fuck up, listen, count to 100, take a deep breath and then again, listen.

Majority of people fail to realise that the European traders never went inland until the mid 19th century when Imperialism took hold, more commonly known as the Scramble for Africa. Basically, what this means is that the European slave traders bought their slaves from Black Africans that sold them, Black Africans. A notion that is generally ignored because that doesn't suit the whole; White people are bad and Black people are oppressed-talk.

British people were allowed to own slaves in England up to 2010 before that law was removed. So while slavetrade had been banned in the British Empire in the early 19th century. The owning of slaves was not banned until 10 years ago. Let that sink in. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j4XrIhqIic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j4XrIhqIic)

If I had to be so pent up about the history of my forefathers for what they did I would be so insanely braindead at the end of the day. I don't know how exactly he phrased it but Putin once said that; He was saddened the USSR had fallen but at the same time, he did not wish it back because it is in the past.

We are to learn from history or doomed to repeat it. What is happening now is nothing short of a bookburning and what we call the Beeldenstorm in the Netherlands; Catholic iconography and statues being smashed to pieces by the Protestant reformation during the 16th century which is one the things that lead to war with Spain; a devout Catholic nation at the time, still is.

You don't tear down racism against black people by saying the whites are bad. You don't solve police violence by defunding the police. Crime in New York City and Chicago, places that have defunded the police already, is rampant.

Learn from the Germans, they know what was done in name of their country during World War 2. They accepted that and they want to stay clear from any repeats in the future. How should the USA, according to so many Americans the "best" country on Earth, not being able to do the same? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had to look up what you meant with the younger dryas period and theres plenty of tell what it was and what was before. Part of it has been described in the Bible, particularly the Noah arc and part of it has been described by Plato.

Even more, the Emerald Tablets as made by Hermes Trismegestus describe the tale of what was before. That said, a majority of sources talking about the Emerald Tablets are false or try to convey their message about them.

Evidence of the flood 13.000 years ago are present in many old cultures around the world, one more closely to the truth than others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ahh..Human ignorance and arrogance: Thinking the Earth needs our help for whatever reason we can conjure up. Doesn't matter if its climate or the population of animals and plants, She does not need our help. Humanoids have been around for the past 3.3million years, the Earth has been around for 4,5billion years.

Even if we as a species manage to fuck up and make in it inhability for humans doesn't mean the Earth as a whole is screwed. She has been through periods worse than we can imagine at the moment. Temperatures that were 15degrees celcius higher on average and temperatures that have been much lower than today.

We are already in an extinction event but even so, it won't be the largest extinction event. That was the Permian-Triassic extinction event which killed 83% of known species at the time. We don't know how long it took for said event to happen, only that some species stopped existing after that event, for all we know, that event lasted thousands of years.

Ecologists have already found life in the areas that were devestated by the Mount St Helens eruption in 1980 which means that life can and will recover much faster than we think it does.

&#x200B;

As for the USA. It will implode. There's no other possible direction for it. Any attempt at change is met with violence, anger and fear. It's a miracle that even with the amount of guns and people seen carrying firearms during the protests that it hasn't spiralled out of control, even though people have been killed and injured during the protests.

The current climate in the USA is not one that is solving racism, it is one that is ever increasing the racism by putting the blame on the white americans that have nothing to do with the slavery in America's history. </TEXT>

I can already guarantee that you can't, because there's no such thing in the files.

When factions are pressured and losing, they confederate to increase their power because they can't through conquest.

A grimgor can still confederate without armies by winning a defensive siege battle against a GS faction leader much in the same way you can. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I've been told women have the innate ability to renew their energy and thus cleanse each month; menstruation. Men cant do this and thus need to flow through another.

My understanding of this is that for a man being able to flow through another person can cleanse your energy and remove physical and/or emotional blockages.

Traditional relationships have men flow through women and her then cleansing her body from the mans and hers energy each month.

How this works for gay men I dont know. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So during corona I was unable to exercise because swimming pool and gyms were closed. So what I did during corona was to effectively half my dinner portions, which is great since now I spend waaaaay less on groceries each month.

Back then I noticed that I would get a hunger feeling after 2-3hours after lunch/dinner.

I started exercising again in 2nd week of july and since then, I effectively get said hunger feeling half an hour after lunch/dinner.

I dont eat between lunch and dinner but do allow some snack in the evening but stil go to bed with said hunger feeling.

Its basically there throughout the day.

So, I'm wondering if this is me being effectively under my TDEE because my body is asking for food continously. I dont count calories because its either not bothering with or hyperfocus on it for me, so I'd rather choose the former. </TEXT>

Ok, so I log out and am immediately logged back in with a prompt asking me to enter a username. If I do this, I get to a page with some code that does fuck all.

I checked my dlc in steam and the spidershrine is not there, the black orc boss somehow is? Even though I cant recall having done anything for it, but thats cool, I just cant get the spidershrine to work...

<TEXT> I finally started going to the gym again after corona and started a working out schedule last friday. This morning I went, because I want to go 2 times a week to the gym, 1 time to the swimming pool and once it starts I'll have ballroom dancing on sundays, and just for the heck of it I stepped on a weighing scale near the lockers.

It said 99.1kg, which in all fairness, is only slightly above a 98.7kg's I weighed back in december so despite corona and lack of exercise I only gained 1lb. Fair enough in my book. The weirdest thing however, is that when I was finished with all the exercises I stepped on the scale again and it said 97.3kg... That's almost a full 2kg's of weight I had lost during exercise but how on earth is that possible?

The only thing I can think off is loss of water due to transpiration but can that really be to such an extent in a single workout? The majority of transpiration is when I get on the crossfit for 15minutes and get going, but after that I hardly notice it.

Or did I get some magic voodo during the exercising that indeed lost me that 1.8kg's? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wouldnt call it fermented sadness.

In my case I was not allowed to express sadness as a kid so I didnt learn how to.

That meant that when I was sad for a prolonged period of time I would grow more and more frustrated because I could not express and thus release the sadness I felt.

Especially during the onset of my depression and the darkest part of it I held a lot of anger in me that was basically me being furious at my inability to release the sadness.

Even now, whenever I feel sad for a couple of days and dont talk about it, I feel the frustration within me rise.

Thankfully, I've gone from complete bursts of anger to being able to talk about it. Havent cried in a long while so there still is a massive amount of sadness unreleased but its not overflowing, just beneath the surface really. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Borstcrawl breathing </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hiya folks,

I took swimming classes in the summer of 2018 to get acquinted with it again since I hadnt swam since childhood.

Once I had those classes I started to swim weekly, building up to 45 minutes of froglegs (dont know english name for it)/basic swim and then after having reached that for a month, I decided to integrate borstcrawl into it.

I now have reached the point I can do 25m of borstcrawl but on the way back I simply run out of air or feel like I'm bursting. Twice I had that I exhaled through my nose while head was in water.

I try to exhale on the third stroke using the corner of my mouth so I wont get all that in my nose but I still run out of breath after 35-40meters.

Any tips on how to improve my breathing, exhale and inhale to improve it?

My aim now is to complete the there-and-back 50m before going for 5 minutes, 10minutes, 15minutes of borstcrawl.

Already thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone has that want or need to be externally validated. You can do all the inner work you can do but certain habits, quirks, positives and negatives you will never, ever find on your own. You need other people in order to grow.

I spend 3 years basically locked up, never got out aside from therapy and one of my helpers basically put in a situation wherein I had no choice but to interact with others, it was a protected work environment for people with mental health issues.

I started there august 2015 and stopped in may 2018 and everyone told me that I was a completely different person when I left than when I arrived. Obviously thats not true, same person, just massively more confident in showing who I am behind the face.

Without that push, I would never have learned the things I have. They gave me the confidence to show myself, the validation was external because I refused to give it to myself. Still do in certain regards.

Last week I glanced over to a friend after a session of Dungeons and Dragons and I just felt like kissing her. Its something completely common, but I've not felt that since 2012, the want to kiss someone. Panic quickly ensued....next time I'll see her is 2 weeks from now so I didnt know what to do with it.

The whole spiel of "does she even like me, was I wrong in having that feeling, oh god its gonna be 3 weeks till I see her again". You know the sentences.

Throughout my depression I had to work on various things at various times. I can say with confidence I'm through that and can remain stable. I still have to do a lot of progress socially, despite becoming adept at holding conversations, I still lack the ability to always express myself and to fulfill any needs I may have.

Likewise I'm now fully aimed at going for a job so I can get out of welfare, in that I again lack that confidence, yet I'm still doing it because the alternative is worse, the sitting at home doing fuck all-thing.

We all need validation, its part of basic human needs. Even if its just the validation of being seen by the bus driver that waits for you to get on. Or the starbucks lady that puts a smily on your latte. Or a nod from the guy you see every day going to school. It doesnt have to big.

Life isnt about the big things, you remember them the most yes, but its the small every day things that do the trick, that makes you fall in love with someone and miss the most when they're not around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a lesbian, not even a girl, but my first time having sex was a month before I turned 23 and now that I'm 30 I can still count on one hand the amount of times I had sex. Never had a relationship either.

In my early 20ies I also was sexually frustrated and had this notion of forever alone, didnt help that I was severely depressed at the time, socially isolated and basically missed several shots at sex and relationships, which made me hate myself even more.

But overtime I grew to accept that I am alone. I do not require a girlfriend in order to maintain my emotional health, I dont require a girlfriend in order to be myself, have confidence (however much I have that is) and improve myself.

It sucks, especially when my brother has 2 kids, my nieces have kids, generally everyone my age has kids or starting to have kids. That doesnt mean I'll never get a girlfriend.

Nor does it mean neither of you 2 will meet a girl that will make you happy.

The general gist of modern society is that you have to fall in love in 2 days, get dating within the week and proclaim your love after the 3rd week...
Thats not how love works. Love is strongest when it can grow overtime. You dont know someone, even after 2 months of blissful dating and hot steaming sex. You only seen her in the best days, not the worst at that point.

Have patience, take stock at your life. Where are you at? College, just starting work? Moving to a different city? Some moments do not require the distraction of a relationship, how annoying the loneliness and sexual desires at that point are.

I know I'm not a girl, but I do hope my words can give some form of support. You're far from the only ones with those issues, be them girls, men, straight, gay or lesbian. I always hated it when they told me; you're still young, but you 2 are much younger than I am. </TEXT>

Think about it, everyone is worried if you have cancer.

Everyone then tells you to cheer up if you have a depression.


People prefer to hide anything to do with mental illness, not so much because they dont understand it, but because it frightens them. The vast majority of people suffer with mental illness in one way or another, the one more visibly than another aswell.

Because people hide it, from themself and others, they also prefer not to be confronted with it through others.

The notion also remains that, you must be crazy if you're psychologically unstable, and crazy people dont belong on the street

That said, psychopaths and narcissists are generally able to fulfill high position jobs cuz they dont care about their actions effect, as long as it brings in result, which usually happens at the expense of others. </TEXT>

There is such a thing like children of parents with drug use/mental issues.

If they refuse to seek help, doesnt mean you shouldnt seek help.

A lot of what we're given by our parents during childhood will stick with us later in life. So definately seek help in order to find out in which areas they have prevented your growth, where your potential issues lie and make sure to work on them before they become problematic for you as an individual. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Visited Angkor Wat and experienced tranquility. The weeks after were quite the emotional storm. Realized that something, or someone, higher than Man had send me there. (2011)

Upon return I started philosophising through weed and retreating from human life, sank into depression and did my best to hide my emotions, hurt the one person I felt love for and moved to a new city (2012). Sank further into darkness and despair until I stopped using weed. (2013)

Slowly my emotional balance returned over the course of a few years and went outside again to relearn social skills after 3 years of isolation (2015). This helped me further heal myself till I had build up a strong social foundation, skill wise (2018).

Since then been working on expanding my social network from scratch and finding a job wherein I can utilise my strengths in order to help those suffering depression or other mental illnesses. </TEXT>

You cant turn it off because it is an essential function of the brain. Without it you cannot determine any threats. You can however train the brain in the activation or rather, non-activation of the amygdala.

The body has basically 2 modes; fight/flight and relaxation with both having their own nervous system. Being able to tell your body to go into and stay within the relaxation, or parasympathethic, nervous system means that the amygdala is not activated.

Various forms of mindfullness are aimed at strengthening and supporting that parasympathethic nervous system, even if they never mention it, the relaxation and calmness from those exercises are benefitting that system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Except that experiments conducted AFTER WW2 found out that majority of people can and will commit attrocities because someone in authority tells them to do it.

The Stanford prison experiment is one of those. The Milgram experiment also shows this and because so controversial the entire ethical debate on what can and cant be experimented on in psychology.

Then take into account th Asch experiment where if a majority goes in one direction, people will be inclined to follow, even if they know the majority is wrong. However, further studies on Asch' experiment has shown that if the majority is large enough it can and will influence the minority into thinking the majority is in fact correct. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It seems you are unaware of the stories of people losing thousands and thousands of $ to a 60$ game with "just cosmetics" microtransactions.

Fucking educate yourself. These companies apply gambling psychology to these microtransactions that are not RATIONAL inputs to those susceptible to it. KIDS are more susceptible to them than adults and even a sane person may have an addictive personality without knowing it.

So to spew that moron argument of "just cosmetics" with "dont pay if you dont want to" is the worst, disgusting and apologetic shit people can conjure up to sweettalk these changes into 60$ games!

Its idiots like you that allow companies to put that shit in games that have no fucking place for them.

I dont have an install dvd for windows 8 (pre-build pc) and I cant revert to windows 8 either because its longer than 10 days ago.

I found an option that says; I changed my hardware which asks me to log onto my microsoft/hotmail account but even that is a dead end because I never tied my hotmail to the windows installation. So even after I log into it, it asks me a second password or a repeat of it and it just stalls there, nothing that I can do.

I do have a windows 7 dvd lying around, but I'd rather not use it in case my old pc needs to be used for something.

I have found some windows keys for prices as low as 25€ for home edition but to be fair, I dont know how legit those stores are but 145€ is just too much. This new build already has been over budget...rather not go over it even more. </TEXT>

Today that new build was finally finished and has a new motherboard, new ddr4 RAM and extra SSD. I used the old SSD on which I had windows installed from the previous build and the HDD that came with that old build transferred into the new build.

However, despite the windows key being a legit key, windows is now telling me that I do not have a legit working version of windows and gives me the following error code;

Windows has determined that the hardware of your device has changed. Errorcode: 0xC004F211.

I'd rather not shill over 145€ to get a windows key when I already have a legit one.  </TEXT>

A movie that portrays this is 'A beatiful mind'.

Bipolar disorder means that someone can flip from one extreme to the other without rhyme or reason, coupled with psychotic episodes this can come across as disturbing to their environment, especially if they cant distinguish between hallucination and reality.

While love and support is definately what everyone needs, therapy can create the foundation for you to build that love and support.

I've been socially isolated for years and last tuesday during DnD there was a talk about how long the group has been together.

I may not feel 100% that they are friends, I do feel that their presence and time spend with them, allows me to break free from the social isolation.

Its not easy to make friends, especially when you feel alone and start to hide yourself more and more but aslong as you take steps, be them small or large, in the direction that feels right for you, you'll get there one way or another.

Good luck, because you are worth the time and presence of others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Substancs (ab)use blocks the hormonal connections in the brain thus obfuscating the true emotion someone feels at a time. Even "medication" for mental "illness" is nothing more than blocking hormonal pathways in the brain that dampen and hide emotions.

During my depression I smoked for the first half of it and if I would've abstained, I'd have made different decisions than I have done now.

That said, emotional control is impossible. Its a bodily function as much as going to the loo. All one can achieve is recognizing them and if need be, influencing his/her environment to relieve oneself of "negative" emotions.

Dont get thick skin. Sensitive people are the most wonderful in the world, and with sensitive I dont mean the "I get offended at everything" kind of person, because those are driver by Ego and are destructive to everything they dont understand.

With sensitive I mean those that are able to see the subtleties in human behaviour and feel the change of atmosphere when one leaves or enters a room. The ripples that can be send forth by a simple smile or the helpings of another. Seeing a treestump where there used to be a trees and feeling the sadness for it.

The brain can be trained, much like any other muscle in the body. It does have, however, a mind of its own and does not always like to be disciplined.

Good luck with your recovery, its okay to feel down when you feel like that, after all. If one is running for months on end, having that lie down on the ground can be rejuvenating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The days everyone could earn skins through ingame accomplishments are now superceded by paid skins and you think thats fine just cuz it doesnt impact gameplay....

Guess I'm the only one that remembers how devs put a ton of free, cosmetic, unlockables in their games that were yours the moment you purchased the game. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You say you're re-evaluating life.

Theres your answer.

If the old doesnt suit you anymore, you need to find the new. That can take a while.

Life isnt about constant magic.

I've gotten severely depressed (diagnosed) at 22 years old. The past 8 years (30 now) I've been busy working on myself. The first 3 years to get out of that depressions, the following 3 years working on my self-esteem, confidence and social skills, the past 2 years I've been focussed on building a social network, getting ready for a job and such.

When I look at how I spend the week during my depression and how it is now, theres hardly a difference. I still spend most of my time alone, no friends whom I trust, no job, no diploma, spending a lot of time on the pc BUT my approach to life is completely different.

Life isnt just about the happy days. You need the bad days because those are where you grow. Nothing grows when the sun is always out. Rain is required and so too is the night.

So rejoice, you stepped out of that bubble of "everything must be happy". </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd rather go the way of using existing traits and creating an environment that suit those traits and then see how well those traits have developed over the course of several generations.

The animals I'd use are cassowary for their dromeosaurid-like claw on their 2nd digit and the Hoatzin, whose juveniles sport the claws used for climbing or digging in some oviraptorids.

So, for the cassowaries I'd create an environment that would drive them towards a carnivorous diet, since they are omnivores, and speedy prey to increase their leg strength.

For the Hoatzin I'd create an environment that would allow even adults to retain their claws and then build on from that.

Needess to say, an experiment like this would take decades, perhaps even centuries for cassowaries (50+ year lifespan) so getting even through 10 generations is going to take a long time.

But the general premise is to provide an environment, or multiple environments, that would suit their theropod-like traits and have nature take charge in developing them in order to minimise negative and harmful traits.
This doesnt mean you cant have a helping hand since you can still remove individuals without desired traits but unlike in breeding you will give the popuation time to adjust to new traits, instead of solely focussing on the "desired" traits which has caused so many issues in many breeds of dogs. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2020-06-05 23:14:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, 10 years back I had a reasonably large gathering of "friends". When depression hit hard they basically appointed me as some bad guy and I ended up dropping them all.

This ensured that the next 3 years I had no social life at all, aside from professional help and I frequently threw my anger at people for not giving a dam about me.

In 2015 I started to work in a protected environment wherein I gained some notion of social skills again but no lasting relationships.

I left there in 2018 due to a merger. I found a dnd group afterwards and while it is fun when playing, I dont really talk to them outside of it, but the rest of the group does talk to each other outside of it.

Fast forward to today and I still feel like I dont care for others, that I am still keeping others at a distance. I know it is an attempt at self-protection but I do want to gain friendships again because it is starting to become frustrating that I want to be with people but not have people to be with.

How can I regain trust in other people and with it also start caring for others again? What helped others in regaining that trust and care? </TEXT>

However, I just realised that the harddrive on which the OS is installed is a small SSD direclty connected to the mobo of the old one.

My new mobo is the x470 gaming plus and I am not sure if it supports this SSD.

From what I've gathered its an mSATA 128gb but the only thing I can find is talk about m.2 SSD.

Can I, or can't I plug this old ssd onto my new mobo? </TEXT>

<TEXT> If, after all these years of protesting in te US, because its hardly a new thing, you still have not found the cause...then well...no one can show you.

So lets look at France; The French Gilles Jaunes did it. They hit the French government where it hurt and they buckled it, but they had something you guys protesting in thd US dont have; Unity. All French people regardless of faith, wealth, gender, colour were protesting the same problem.

What do you in the US have? One protests the judicial system, the other protests against gay rights, that guy next to it is protesting the right for abortions, the lady next to it is protesting against the guy Then we have three people saying "Ya'll motherfuckers need Jesus". At the other side of the street Jesus is looking for a job alongside 20 other immigrants, then there are some women shouting about how all straight white men are rapists and how they are raped right now by some passerby wondering wtf is going on.

Then you have a couple of donkeys screaming abuse at some elephants whom scream abuse back. Then there are some black people protesting police brutality while the donkey and elephant are tear gassed and run over by police.

Can you see the picture? Cuz I can. Meanwhile those that should be targetted by the protests are laughing at the television because they dont have to do a thing. They're not worried, cuz you'll never put aside your differences, they made sure of that.

I'm not gonna deny that there most certainly are racists, on either side of the fence. Those people are minor. They only speak out because they know others are listening.

Unite as a country, not as a race. You dont need bandaid solutions that work for a year. You need long lasting changes that change the fabric of the US society. </TEXT>

For that answer I would point you to someone that is acquinted with astrology. Those that practice it generally have a good knowledge on what energies are present. Not sure if they can tell where it came from.

If you're worried the energy is send by alien X or Y then I can assure thats not the case. Earth is a place of non-interference and personal choice and the energies arriving at this planet are providing the planet and its inhabitants with the tools to grow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hardly call it important.

What you should be finding more important is how they can take an entire population of angry Americans and instead of being faced with that, they do a very handy job at having those angry Americans being angry at each other, instead of those that keep a broken system in place.

Doesnt matter if its racial; black/white/hispanic/asian or political; democrat/republican or gender; male vs female or even age; gen Z vs boomers.

As long as Americans are divided by those, in the grand scheme of things, very arbitrary divisions, nothing will change because you are too busy squabling amongst each other.

Instead, Americans that are pissed off need to stop bashing in the heads their neighbours political view, gender or skin colour and march together, in spite of it, against those perpetuating these divisions in their societies.

Do that, and change is bound to come. Refuse, and in 20 years you're still protesting the same things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Theres a difference between people of caucasian descent or latin-american descent. Mexicans see themselves as white yes but Latin-America is used for all of South-America.

"white Americans with no Latin American ancestry make up 52.7% of the population".

In that 73% are many latin-americans that consider themselves white. But the use of colour in statistics is in and of itself a form of racism. I rather prefer to use terms as caucasian, hispanic and african-american because these donates regions of origin instead of colour of skin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I dont have any sentiment towards the whole situation in the US because I dont live there. For me the reports are no different than reports from French riots in Paris, Venezuelan riots in Caracas or riots in Hong Kong or Greece or Spain/Italy/Russia/Germany/Iran/England.

People struggle everywhere regardless of colour, gender or wealth. Struggles in the US are different than the struggles in France, which are different from the struggles in Peru or Hong Kong.

So no, the protests in the US are not worthy of my attention to decipher the intricate details of why and how they're happeming. To me its baffling that those protests have been going on for the past decade without tangible result, other than a heavily militarized police force that cracks down harder than supposed dictatorial regimes alongside poltical and journalistic people calling for the army to deal with.

When the bullets start flying, they dont care if you're black or white, hispanic or asian. Or have you forgotten how, since race is so important, white students were gunned down by the national guard while protesting the war in Vietnam?

The issues in the US are not racial, they are class-issues. Lower class, middle class, upper class and elite. The racial talk is just there to distract you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is no denying that the situation in the US is one that could've been prevented, if changes were made. I've read speculations that the US is heading for civil war, one more disastrous than the one between the Confederacy and the North because its the common people, not the states.

No one would want that but at one point it becomes inevitable and no amount of Gandhi's are going to stop that avelanche once it starts rolling.

I sincerely hope that won't come to pass but I can understand the frustration of millions of Americans against a system, political and judicial, that is inherently against them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everything has to be in balance. Having your frequency go from high to low all the time will give a lot of disparity.

For examples sake, lets take 60 as your average out of 100.
When you're feeling down, anxious, frustrated, your freq might go as low as 30, so in order to counter that you raise your vibration to 90.

Now, when you are on that 90, all is well, but because 60 is your base average, you will need to experience that down as much as you experienced that high; balance.

So what about a stable frequency?

We again take 60 as the base and instead of raising the frequency when feeling down, we just let it be.

At first, there is no difference at all, the seesaw goes wildly back and forth between low, base and high. After a while however, the disparity becomes less.

The 30 that you experienced, is now only a 40, but so too is the high only an 80 instead of 90.
Giving it more time, it becomes 50 and 70 and perhaps, if one gives him/herself that time, the frequency becomes 58-62.

The advantage of a stable frequency, instead of one thaf fluctuates a lot, is peace with how one is feeling.

In the above example the level of anxiousness remain the same, its just that the way one deals with and accepts that anxiousness is different.

I'm not gonna say I'm at that point of being stable, cuz then I'd be lying. But throughout the years I have come to the realisation that I mucb prefer a vibration that remains the same, instead of going all over the place. </TEXT>

The fact that the people in the US act the most extreme on it is a different discussion alltogether.
Saying it is because of racism is also ignoring the statistics that majority of people killed in the US by police are white men, not black men. Its just not worthy of reporting, in lieue of playing the racism card, to have white men killed by police as the firestarter to the protests. </TEXT>

Dont worry about the protests, these too will subside. I am more worried about any potential reactions from the government. Their actions will determine an escalation or de-escalation of the situation.

<TEXT> Hiya

I have a 5year old Acer Predator G3 and I am now upgrading it. Considering I still have good functioning parts other than outdated CPU I decided to forego an entirely new pc and just replace the parts that need replacing; PSU (500 to 650) RAM (ddr3 to ddr4) CPU (i5 4590 to ryzen 2600x) and obviously the motherboard.

Everything has come out without issue, except for the mobo. I removed the screws, the cpu cooler and everything I can see that holds it in place but the dam thing refuses to come out if it...

Is there something I'm missing here? Tried fudging open the other side of the case but no luck there and getting a bit frustrated.

Already thanks, will put pic in comment below if thats possible

Edit: found the culprit, little shit was hiding under the RAM </TEXT>

Their energy lifts you up, your energy lifts them up, which in turn lift everyone up.

When you meet those people you have someobe of the same frequency around and that resonates throughout the world and universe and far stronger than physical desires and wanton.

There is no reason required nor do you hsve to use it one way or another. Just let it be, the existence is the quiet. Hence the mind is silent when looking for the answer, and screams at you ever so quietly :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Realising is the first step.
The next step is realising that no matter what people tell you, there is no shortcut to it.

Once you understand those things you have to sit down and objectively look at your life. Can you really go without technology or is it required to do things like keeping your house clean, commuting from and to work, hygiene and so forth. Technology is a tool, its not good nor bad.

What about society is evil exactly? Its merely a human construct that doesnt adhere to natural laws. So find your place in that natural order, wherever that may be or look like.

Understanding you dont want to live like you are now is a good first step, but dont go for the wanting to be awoken, you might see things you'll dislike or can't face in your current state. Instead, you should let it unfold as it should, no forcing the matter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are things far greater than love beyond our current human understanding. These have been shown by people like Jesus and Buddha for all to reach towards to.

When you love silence, then you hate the noise that disrupts it. You can tell yourself to let it be, but it will gnaw on you.

The law of balance requires it and the only way to not be adherent to that law is to neither love nor hate and sit in the middle of that seesaw. It doesnt mean to be indifferent at all, what it does mean, I dont know, I'm not there at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anger in and of itself is not bad and anger used correctly can propell something forward.

That said, anger is most often used in a destructive manner instead of in a constructive manner.

For example; angry for not receiving a payraise like your colleague thats not delivering on his work
Destructive; smash the office window and get sacked
Constructive; going to your manager and telling him whats what in the workplace and how your contributions are more valuable than what you earn at the moment

It may not get you that payrise but the way the anger is used is a massive difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Still an ongoing debate really.

If we take the scientific arm of psychology and especially behaviourism; conciousness is a side-effect of the working brain. According to B.F. Skinner.

If we're delving deeper in the brain, looking at fMRI scans, we notice that two areas of the brain light up when thinking; Broca's area (production of speech) and Wernicke's area (perception of speech).

Studies with people in rooms devoid of visual, audio and sensory input have concluded that in the absence of input, the brain creates its own input.

But thats science and imo, science can be very limiting to itself because it wants to test everything, otherwise its "wrong" by default.

Personally, there are various aspects to thought.

First of all there are the intricacies of the human brain which, unfortunately has to be adhered to.
Secondly, if we can perceive our own thoughts, by my logic, it means that we receive it outside of the confines of our brains.
Thirdly, not all decision making goes through thinking. There is intuition, gut instinct, emotional decision making.

If your head is filled with chitter chatter, then simply engage with it, talk to it, listen to it, adress where necessary, set boundaries and if necessary tell the associated voice to get lost. It may sound odd, because thats not a "normal" way to look at your mind but what helps, helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Talk to the voice, ask why it is so negative to you, ask where it comes from and simply talk to it. It'll respond and try to bring you off balance but just talk to it.

If people have told you as a kid that you needed to do this or that in order to be succesful, than that is something that has become ingrained in you. It has taken me a very long time to break the whole "Think first, act later" which has held me down for a long time. I never did anything because I could always think of a negative result and so never did anything.

But now, to my suprise, I can act in the moment without having to worry about what I did or why I did and all that stuff.

A lot of people see Spirituality as something large and big but it's the small things. It's not meditating and experiencing some amazing manifestation. It's being a better person today than you were tomorrow. Better at loving yourself, better at tempering yourself, better at telling the obnoxious voice in your head to shut up and listen to you for once.

A person that has helped me a lot in my journey has always said that no one is further than the next person, everyone is right where they should be at that point in time. Learning to accept where you are in life, whether good or bad, is a step in the right direction. Who cares if you go at lightning speed or slower than a snail, as long as you keep moving you're still in the "race". </TEXT>

<TEXT> Theres nothing elitist about it, its just a frequency. When you tune into radio all stations have a different frequency, usually for AM between 90 and 108 where I live. The 107 frequency isnt more elite than the 92 frequency, it just is.

When talking about vibrations you shouldnt confuse it with matter. A person with a high frequency is still as solid as a person with a low frequency, an attuned crystal is still as solid as an unattuned crystal.

So matter, which is solid based on how quick or slow the atoms move plays a different role than the frequency of conciousness in the material world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I suppose geography and social make-up also impact this. I live in a small city (roughly 200k inhabitants) with several universities and the most prominent city center of the country, so a lot of clubs and dining in the are though actual social events are scarce.

I never enjoyed clubbing but I do enjoy the pub. I suppose its difficult to meet single moms in such environments. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For a long while in my 20s I was feeling I needed a gf (which isn't smart when you're in a depression) and near the end of it I stopped with that train of thought.

I was slowly re-engaging socially since I recovered enough from depression but then corona hit and it all ground to a halt.

But I feel comfortable enough alone even though I do have the need for intimacy and sex every now and again, for which a gf would be really nice and much more preferred than one-nighters or casual fucks. I cant have casual sex because its just the motions then. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Weed can seem like a wonderplant and often called it, but it can cause an awful lot of mental illness that is then not seen by the user. I often said it helped me aswell but in hindsight, it ensured my depression and the results of it was the small list I named in previous comment.

My first psychologist told me that if I wanted therapy to work, I had to quit smoking.

Ah yeah, theres always that. I hope you have enough to atleast get going a bit, a lot of people with mental issues never seek help which only makes it worse, not only for them but also for immediate family and friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Weed can also cause an awful lot of mood swings.
I smoked a fuckton back in the day and it cost me my college, my friends and a girlfriend, simply because I was unable to express what I was going through. That inability for me caused a lot anger and frustration that burst out at the most random moments. Havent smoked in 7 years and my mood is much more stable now then it was then.

GP's should be available everywhere. Simply google it in your living area. They are mandatory where I live because insurance wants them to refer you to hospital and such otherwise they wont pay for it.

If possible, get into contact with that therapist and see if you can set something up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You answer the tests based on a set of questions you have to answer based on last week and/or last month. So they do take into considersion the immediate past.

Keep in mind that all those tests are snapshots of your current situation, not past or future. In therapy, if you get a good one that actually does it instead of pushing pills, you can dig deeper into the past which makes it easier to find the roots for certain behaviours. Like being told as a kid to shut up everytime you expressed sadness will lead to problems with emotional expression in adolescence, as an example.

Psychologists are still unsure about the whole "running in the family"-nature vs the whole "I grew up exposed to"-nurture debate in regards to mental illness in families. Both are defining factors but they are still squabbling about how much.

In the end, the tests are generalized and the in-depthness comes with therapy. Do go for that instead of pills...pills will only hide the problems + you can get dependant/addicted to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personal observations can be clouded by negative experiences. Hence the objective view from someone that doesnt know you is so important for that diagnosis.

A GP is a general practitioner. Basically your personal doctor before medical specialists get into play.

It takes balls to make a decision to stand by it and I've had moments where I was like, if I'd get a girl pregnant, I'd honour her wishes and do my best to support her.

If you're into movies and could do with some perspective, Knocked Up is one about an upcoming, unplanned kid. Its obviously a movie so its all dramatized and such but it can help with that bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not criticizing anyone. Without the OBJECTIVE view from a professional and a very intensive test (I had to take 5 seperate tests for my diagnosis of schizotypical personality, since then changed, avoidance personality, still somewhat here, and severe depression, less severe now) you cant say for certain if you're depressed and what to do with it.

 Mood changes are present in a large variety of mental issues and for the better part of my severe depression-period I did not experience any emotions at all. My affect was flat and expressing or even recognising them was non-existant.

So, again, get a professional to do a test so that you have an objective view. Go through your GP if that makes things easier.

Oh and...

If I'm here to criticize you I'd say the following; you're 20 and you're getting a kid? Are you mental? You cant even properly take care of yourself, how on earth will you take care of the kid? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Except that any form of brain altering chemical, be that alcohol, weed, shrooms, mdma, dmt, you name it, alters the experience and distorts it. Hence a terrible joke might be a light shake of the head sober but absolutely hilarious when high.

I've smoked a ton of weed while exercising a lot of introspection at the same time, nothing of it has stuck since I've stopped smoking.

You see, experiencing something through the use of drugs is like kicking open a locked door, without knowing which door you're kicking open.

Whereas when you get to it sober, through growth and introspection, that door is unlocked by its own and you know whats behind it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone has someone like that. Madly in love with him/her and before you realise it. S/he is gone and out of reach.

For me it happened during my depression, wasnt till I lashed out at her in frustration and she broke contact that I realised the scope of my love for her.

Thats been nearly 8 years ago and I worked hard on myself to recover from my depression. Met girls here and there but nothing remotely like what I felt for she-that-got-away.

Every now and again I reminisce on my time with her and the longing for a relationship and settling grows, but none of the women I've met thusfar have aroused that same desire in me.

I feel that I'm somewhat holding on to her, atleast the memories, somewhere, even though I made peace with how it ended. But I cant bring myself to fully commit myself yet.

Anyone with tips on how to get past this? Inbe4 the just go wild and hook up, thats not my cup of tea, more of a slow to get to know kinda person </TEXT>

<TITLE> Venting about broken vent </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-05-04 16:51:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last week I started noticing the smell of cigarettes entering my living from the corner. Turned out that the only possible explanation is a leak in the ventilation that runs past it.

So I told the people that run the building and they told maintenance and now I just have to wait....

But every fucking time I get that smell in my living room I get so fucking frustrated because I cant do anything about it and am basically not comfortable in my own living room until that smell is gone, and it takes atleast 10-15 minutes before its gone.

If I could do anything I would but this all comes down to how quickly maintenance calls and how long it takes before they can actually show up.

Being chased out of my living room by this fucking smell is putting an enormous damp on my mood which is already affected by the whole covid shit to the point I can see myself breaking down in anger and frustration.

I dont have a large appartment so the only place I can to to is my bedroom, but I really dont want to be stuck in my bedroom everytime someone decides to smoke....the only thing I can think off is putting a hole in the ventilation casing so that the smell goes out somewhere else than my living room. I've already checked for holes, found one and plugged it but it just shows up somewhere else where I cant see anything....

The smell pisses me off but whats pissing me off more is the fact I have to wait for other people to do something about it because I rent the appartment.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> The following is something I've not wanted people to know, even though I still feel its effects today and to be honest, I want to get rid of it.

When I was 20 I was abroad in Cambodia, Siem Reap to be exact. A tiny city close to the temples of Angkor. It was a saturday evening. I had drank some beer and was greeted by a tuktuk driver with the question of smoking weed.

Because of the alcohol in my system and my good mood I said yes. So I went with him and together we smoked. I was relaxed and we talked abit about our lifes and at that point I felt quite woozy. He brought me to a local supermarket and bought me a sugary drink against the spinning head before bringing me back to my hostel.

During the ride to my hostel I gave him some money to help a small village because their well had been contaminated and so couldnt be used at all. The people in that village still lived in wooden houses far away from civilization.

When we arrived at the hostel I couldnt move. I wanted to walk towards my room, have a wee and go to bed. But that wasnt what happened. The tuktuk driver began offering me cocaine and telling me to go with him to party, whereas I told him I wasnt interested in it, but still I couldnt walk away.

To this day I still dont know how or why it came, but at one point I felt a sensation move up my spine and when it reached my skull, a switch was flipped. Suddenly there was an intense anger and hatred towards the man standing in front of me.
I demanded back the money I gave him and even searched his pockets for it. I distrusted everything he said as if he was vermin. I was completely focussed on him and wouldn't have shied back to fight, probably even wanted to fight him but he remained calm and made sure I didnt escalate.

Still furious I did pay him and walked off, I still dont know why I couldnt walk off before all that, I walked to my room in the hostel and cursed the Earth, she could burn for all I'd care with each and everyone on it.

Then I heard the name of a girl I liked at the time, I heard it 3 times before I told myself that I didnt hate her. This calmed me down and I went to the bathroom to throw up and drink some water. After that I went to bed. The following morning I woke up mentally, physically and emotionally exhausted. I headed to the street I met the tuktuk driver in the hopes of apoligizing for what happened the previous night but I didnt see him, the afternoon I flew to Vietnam.

In Vietnam I realised there was more to the world than the physical. Something above us and that I had to go to those countries for a reason. However, if I think back to the past 9 years, I have carried that hatred and distrust with me and I want it gone.

I want to be happy, give my love to a woman I care about. I want to trust my friends instead of cursing at them for not being there when I feel lonely and sad. I just want to experience something else, than what I have since that moment.

I apoligize if its a long post and perhaps shocking, but I had to express it, if anyone would ask me what my biggest secret is, its this one. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Mods stop working mid campaign </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-04-25 11:38:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, during my Snikch campaign I noticed that several mods (Abandon region, Decline Diplomacy, Respec Legendary Lord) just stopped working.

I unchecked the mods in the launcher, launched game and then exited the game again to recheck the mods. This did nothing. In the end I abandoned the campaign because not being able to skip tens of diplomatic questions about a nap got a bit tedious...

I did a few small abandoned campaigns in between without any noticeable effect on those mods. Then I started a Grombrindal campaign and for a majority of the campaign all the mods worked perfectly. Expanded north to Kislev taking out the orks, saw that Ungrim got his ass handed to him by the Vcounts and confederated him. Then 4 stacks of Vcounts marched on Karak Kadrin and razed it to the ground. It was after this moment that all my mentioned mods stopped working. No more decline diplomacy, no more abandon region....At this point I just gave up on the campaign and uninstalled.

&#x200B;

The Total War launcher has been having moments where it told my mod data was corrupted and couldn't load them. Then I'd close the launcher and start it up again without any issues. Could this be the cause of the mods suddenly not working anymore and should I clear the mod folder and redownload all the mods again? </TEXT>

So I cut down the size of my portion by half for this dinner but am wondering if this is a good way to eventually lose weight, specifically fat tissue. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For as long as I can remember I've been distrustful of other people and have always kept my distance to the point no one has ever seen Me without walls and other defences, even those that I consider to having been close.

Now, when I ask myself why I distrust others I dont get much more than; "What I tell them in trust can be used against me" and "what I tell them in trust is for them, not others".

I've been trying to get a new social circle going for a while now and its going slowly. I dont feel that I have the ability to give trust to these people which is preventing me from connecting to them.

Even when an invitation is offered to me I reject it because I dont trust it. It basically ellicits a small panic reaction to which my first instinct is to reject rather than accept. I'm incredibly wary of accepting any invitations and letting any people in my life.

I like to contribute to a group of friends I had during he onset of my depression but I know this distrust is older than that, probably stemming from childhood instead of my late adolescence.

Does anyone has an idea how to be able to neutralise the distrust I have or to lessen its influence on my interactions with others? </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I am nearing 30 (bday in little under 2 weeks) and I have never had an intimate/romantic relationship.

Closest  I've been to one was a, at the time, very close friend that I loved   but  due to depression never allowed myself to feel nor act on it.   Shortly  after the depression got severe and I lost all social contacts I   had.  It took me up to halfway 2018 to regain my confidence enough to   get back into the world of social contact and make a new social circle,   currently being very much on hold due to corona measures...

Due  to my lack of relationship  experience my brain is telling me its   pointless to even bother  attempting a relationship. Because of my age,   the expectance is there  that I should've had relationships in the past   and this is putting a lot  of pressure on me and with it, would also  put  a lot of pressure on any  women I meet out in the wild.

So, my question is, how much do you take into account whether someone has   or hasn't had a relationship, regardless of why s/he hasn't had one?

tl;dr turning 30 soon, never had relationship, how will it impact my chances for one </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not in tears, havent been able to cry since 2011, but in anger. This covid-debacle has left me in isolation for the past 3 weeks and its still up till the 28th...

I have been unable to ease up, I'm mentally and emotionally so insanely tense that it is slowly driving me insane. I can't even feel anything at the moment, its just apathy, cuz if I did feel something, I'd be drowning.

I want to feel safe for once, for once just letting go of all that tension, all that alertness and let all those walls that I've build, all those masks I created and all those ways of keeping emotional distance, all that, to just go away. Cuz I'm tired of it all, it hasn't done me any good.

I wrote a note of apology for all my angry outbursts and put them in the neighbours mailbox before going out on the bike. Despite loving the moonlit sky when I was younger I could hardly find any solace in it.

I am just not capeable of opening myself up and sitting at home for another 3 weeks, is just gonna make that worse...

I dont even know why I'm writing this, its not a nice picture so it probably wont be read at all, which will just reinforce my negative thoughts and increase rhe locks on my heart

You know I never showed anyone the full and uncovered me? What a waste... </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mental health has tanked over the weekend and I'm back in a state of perpetual frustration...

Pre-pandemic I was creating and building up a social network as well as looking around for possible job/study to do next year.

Prior to that I spend around 6 years in social isolation of which 3 while being severely depressed. The other 3 years has been about relearning social skills and gaining confidence.

The past weekend however, everything is coming down...I havent seen anyone face-to-face since measures have been put in place and it is seriously fucking up my brain. Seeing people through skype or teams isnt doing anything for me and my ambulatory worker is just through phone.

I dont feel like I can leave the house cuz I've had a fever for about a week now, though without any symptoms of anything. My soar throat is more down to my swearing at every little thing that even dares to annoy me even the slightest....

I don't have anyone to talk to cuz my new social circle is not established at all. I have got to know people but its not that I can call them friends, there is still a lack of trust on my end towards them.

This afternoon I just lay on my bed simply because I didnt want to do anything lest it woukd bring out a burst of anger.

I really dont want to break any of my stuff nor do I want to hurl my anger at my pets but the danger of it is there.

I know I'm far from the only person having to deal with loneliness at the moment and I absolutely fucking hate asking for help or god forbid....express how I feel but if I don't...I may hurt my pets in a flash of anger...

I know my anger is merely a mask for all the pain and sadness in my life. The pain that no one has bothered to ask me how I'm doing aside from the ambulatory worker, despite me asking others how they were doing.

Hsck, today I was thinking about how nice it'd be if I was in a mental institution, atleast there would be people around...

All this fucking work I done and its all falling to pieces because someone decided to eat a pengalin that ate a bat or whatever the fuck cause of it....today was the first date of measurements to be lifted ...now its the 28th of April....

I really am scared that I might hurt someone, or myself if these bursts of anger keep going because I'm unable to release whatever the fuck gets stuck in my head...

They say only the unloved hate....guess I'm unloved then </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, so day 41, what has improved? Honestly....not that much I guess.

I have noticed that I'm more in the moment during conversations that would've caught me off guard or left me anxious previously. I used to overthink these sort of situations or freeze while looking for words. Now the thinking is completely superceded by me talking.

I dunno how my confidence with women is, cuz frankly I've not seen any women out in the wild thanks to corona-quarantine for the past 3 weeks, which is extended from april 6th to april 28th.

I guess it is keeping me from slipping away into depression. My mood is stable-ish despite boredom and lack of social contact. Have had frustration and some bursts of anger due to neighbours drilling for four days...

I do not force myself to engage in viewing sexual acts or looking for some sexual release when I lack the physical sexual desire.

What else....not something that comes to mind real quick. I had expected to have fallen back into depression but for now, its stable-ish. Which is nice. Just need to get myself a different thing to do than playing the same game over and over again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ever since the corona-debacle and the cancelling of everything I did out of the house I've not had any social contact. The longest in-person conversation I've had is in the store buying something.

I'm currently on 32-days of no-nut which is a nice amount but the last couple of days I have found that I'm frequenting sex chats, primarily for chatting but it being a sex chat, obviously going sexual at some point.

I dont have a social network, I have been through depression and social isolation and only started rebuilding a social network around mid 2018, but its far from solid and I've not seen or spoken to any of them for a while now.

I know this feeling of loneliness drove me in the past use the sex chats for nutting and if that didnt work I'd frequent porn to get it done even though I'm not sexually aroused at all, just a way to "feel a connection" to someone, even if its just in my mind.

Anyone else struggling with this or something? </TEXT>

<TEXT> During the height of my depression I listened a lot of metal, I was a metalhead, but listenin to some bands kinda drove me deeper in my depression because they worked on the things I was struggling with, primarily bands like Devildriver, Lamb of God and Dark Tranquility were the culprits.

I pretty much stopped listening to them and moved to more mellow music like liquid drum n bass for a long time but now that things are picking up again, mentally, I am starting to crave the power that is in metal, the raw energy that just calls for headbanging and such but everytime I listen to any band from that time, its great for a while but then it kinda becomes meh.

Which is annoying cuz that leaves me without music thats loud and powerful. Doesnt help either that I accidentally wiped my hdd with 100+gb of music on it.

So, do I just have to accept that metal no longer is a genre for me or is it the issue of having that emotional trigger from those bands that put me back in the hayday of my depression?

Anyone with similar music tied to bad mental moment experiences? </TEXT>

I spend the next couple of years with a lot of distrust towards others and slowly but certainly I worked my way into trusting therapists and such.

While I can confide in therapists I still have issues confiding with people I meet in the wild. For the last 1and half year I've been playing DnD with a small group and logically they can be seen as friends but the trust, from my side, isn't there.

Is my mind wanting too much or am I still suffering from the distrust I carried towards my previous group? I know that my head can be a menace in that regard but when I feel lonely I dont feel like I can contact any of them to hang out, even if it would be possible.

I dont have a lot of people in my life, thats fine by me, but to not have someone to call or hang out with does start to eat away at me. </TEXT>

This morning? It was celebrating the girls I have been with before my life went to absolute shite
 (flunked college at 22, 30 in a month, when severely depressed, lost entire friend group at the same time alongside a girl I was starting to become intimate with) and my head went into massive desperation trying to achieve sex through sexchats and such.

Tomorrow marks 21 days or 3 weeks, which is the longest streak I had before I discovered nofap 20 days ago. Main difference between that streak and this one, is that now I've got the strength to stay away from porn and sexchats.

Once I left and browsed steam forum and reddit it passed quite quickly.

I've seen some people say this counts as a relapse, but I didnt engage my arousal, just observed it, and others see masturbating as the relapse.

I guess the question should be...do I feel any worse for having done this...no, not really, it just shows that it is lashed on more than I thought it would, I think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello folks, I had a severe depression for about a few years until the severe could be dropped from it. In that time I gainrd 30kg's, from 70kg to 100kg.

For the past one and a half year I've been going to the gym for an hour a week and swimming for an hour a week. When I started going to the gym I was around 98kg with 2/3rds muscle mass but also 33% fat.

I have thus far stayed the same, around 100kg despite training and seeing progress in the training, my stamina has improved by miles.

A year before I started going to the gym I switched to a non-meat diet, I dont buy it anymore for in the house, I sometimes eat it at my parents or when going out for dinner, and at the time I gained a lot of muscle mass, though not losing a lot of fat tissue.

At this point I'm somewhat miffed at the lack of results from all the working out and have tried lowering my food intake, which thus far only has happened with lunch. Evenings I sometimes overeat or when I have a bad day I may overear due to depression.

Are there any tips that you lot can give me?

My gymroutine is strength exercises, 20 minutes walking, 10 minutes rowing, my swimregiment is 45 minutes of breaststroke and working up to do 10 minutes of breastcrawl. I did 50 meter lap without exploding lungs last tuesday which is rather good for the 4th week of training it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My experience with depression </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-03-02 13:39:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I see a lot of posts discussing the bleakness of depression so I thought I'd share my story. Its a long one but I hope it will show that depression isn't the end and that it can be beaten.

**1) Prelude**

During highschool I just went to school, talked to no one and when classes where done I raced back home to get on the pc and play videogames. When I entered college I was released from the yoke of my parents which allowed me to open up and start talking with those in my class. People listened to me when I spoke and in the year of 2010 there was a particularly good spring.

This resulted in me spending a lot of time with people I met while going to the pub but unlike in college, I wasn't respected in this group of people. I was interupted, ignored or people would repeat my lines often with the result of a laughing crowd. Instead of speaking out my frustration I started to numb them with drugs and turned silent.

This severely impacted my college because I was turned inward and silent there aswell. Instead of the open person I was before. My college grades, or rather, lack thereof, sparked quite a lot of panic in me which again, was hidden away with drug use.

In 2011 I went to Asia for 4 weeks with my college (I studied tourism) and this sparked a culture shock within me. As well as a relationship that went straight into the cliffs and the abstination of the drugs (couldn't really bring them with me now could I?) caused a significant change within me wherein my view on the world around me started changing.

**2) All goes to shit**

The relationship that was blooming before I left to Asia was shattered upon my return. Next to that the culture shock and what I saw in the world around me left me panicked, confused and I simply didn't understand it. I had seen people with nothing being happy, yet people around me were unhappy despite having access to everything.

It took about a month before, after using xtc, I moved from silence to talking again. I started expressing myself somewhat but what primarily happened was me moving into a state of complete observation of the world around me, aided by drugs. This didn't sit well with my parents because I was fined for having drugs with me and it arrived when I was abroad. So the homesituation wasn't great and so I spend more and more time in the group of people that didn't want me around at all. Out of the 10-15 people only 2-3 asked how my time in Asia had been and add the cultural shock, confusion and panick to that and there was a serious disconnect between me and them.

Somehow, I found a new relationship in that period and throughout the summer break I somehow found the movitation to go balls to the wall with my education again. This went well, until the autumn break where a hard realisation hit me. It was the monday and there I was...Lonely as fuck and what started well that schoolyear turned to absolute dogshite. I couldn't concentrate, I started using even more and by december that year everything was just too much to the point I was a ticking mine ready to explode by the merest of waves.

College contacted me, telling me that others were worried about me, making me more pissed. If they're worried about me they should tell me, not someone else!! But I agreed to have talks with the dean. The 2nd half of that year went reasonably well. My grades stabilised and I actually passed them.

I also made the decision to move to the city of college, instead of having to travel and I expressed the desire to stop using drugs. Both of these decisions made me less interesting to my friends, because if they travel, they can't use and if they want to use, they want to be around other users. Which left me with another dose of loneliness once I had moved. Likewise, the relationship that was founded during the summer break was one that kept my head above the water. But now that I didn't see her the 4-5 times a week, I was starting to drown under all the stuff that I was burying with drug use.

It went backwards and near the end of the year I saw my future collapse as I failed to get the grades required to continue on. I made the decision to work on my shit instead of throwing myself at colleges and failing because I couldn't work through it.

**3) Hard work begins**

My relationship broke down but not before I took her advice to go into therapy. After the failing of college this was the only moment I got out of my studentroom. I had no income which meant I had to get myself a welfare going and explain to those people what my situation was. Being unable to really get out of bed and hearing you can easily work 40 hours kinda leaves you stunned.

Likewise, my psychologist told me that if I really wanted therapy to work, I needed to stop using for which she directed me to the rehabilitation center. It was around 2-3 months into therapy that she wanted to do a large personality test so I did that. It was like the only moment for me to get out of the house. I might've been depressed but I still kept to my appointments, even if I did not always show up on time. The morning I got the results of that test I felt quite good, given the situation but that soon ended. I was told I was severely depressed, needed medication and long-term therapy, next to that I had a Cluster A schizotypical personality alongside Cluster C avoidance personality. *I didn't take medication based on the fact that I was still using at the time and because I've got an addictive personality*

I was left stunned. I couldn't say a word. I left and just cycled around for 3 hours. Don't ask me where I've been cuz I don't know. I eventually ended up in a bookstore and bought a book about High Sensitive People and started reading that.

I did an awful lot of reading at the time. I read Power vs Force which I used to alter my thinking, I read Man and his Symbols and became somewhat obsessed with anything to do with the mind. Trying my utmost to decipher whatever lay dormant within me so that I could do something about it. I was also delving into spiritual matters like the Soul and the Indian system of chakra's.

When I was unable to do anything and lay in my bed my thoughts were dark, flooded with images of horrid creatures to the point I wanted to scoop my eyes out simply to stop those images. Other times I wanted to slit my wrists in crowded areas just to see who would help. Most of the times, my thoughts were apathetic to the suicidal thoughts but one morning, I was shocked and distraught at the thought of slitting my wrist in a crowded area. I had stopped using drugs at this time which meant some form of emotional activity was returning.

My psychologist interred me, voluntarily, upon hearing this because I couldn't guarantee my own safety. I spend a week there and it brought some calmness to me, some rhytm. Everything I lacked being stuck in my small studentroom. I shortly after took the decision to spend 3 weeks abroad with a family in the middle of no where.

It was a tough first week, all the sadness that was hidden in my day-to-day situation now poured out and I had nothing to hide it with, I had to face it. The second week was more of a neutral period, I can't remember much from this but by the third week, I was energized, motivated, hopeful and ready to rumble.

When I arrived back home I was transferred from my psychologist to a dedicated mental health institution and there was loads I wanted to talk about with my psychologist but she was already wrapping up. I was expecting myself to fall into the same deep dark pit I fell into the year before when I flunked college. But it didn't happen. The deep dark pit was still there but I didn't fall.

What came next were 3 years of hard work. My case manager was a fiesty one but also highly supportive and through her I learned a lot. I always tried to downplay my successes but one day she told me to take it, don't say a word, just nod when I was given a compliment. I had to supress my urges to wave away compliments and it allowed me to accept compliments more readily.I was also signed up for various courses that had to do with communication. I never talked to anyone but the professionals and despite trying to go outside and meeting people, I never had the confidence to do so (Still don't but meh) and they primarily served as a distraction and a means to get out of the house. I was still doing the same thing I had been doing since high school, playing a metric ton of videogames, preferrably those that gobble up time like crazy.

In 2015 I moved again, from my small studentroom to an appartment where I still live. The immensity of space that was suddenly available to me was overwhelming and that caused a massive dip in my mood to which I was, basically forced, to go and participate in a protected work environment. Making decisions wasn't always my strong suit, especially when I started bringing up all the reasons why I shouldn't make that choice but at the same time I needed a kick under my arse and so I was given that.

**4) Regaining confidence**

I then spend 3 years in the protected work environment. I didn't care for the work because it was a 2nd-hand store that sold primarily clothing, some books, miscellaneous items and some electric hardware. I primarily used the work environment to train my social skills, I must've done like 5 different communicational courses through those 6 years and up unto then, I never had people around me to the point I could actively use what I had learned.

Slowly, I started regaining my confidence, the people around me also came from a mental health background and having their own issues which meant that there was a lot of recognition and support within the work environment among the colleagues.

It was a lot of work though, I had to pull my arse out of bed and especially in the early stages of me working there I called in sick quite often because I didn't want to go out of bed. I was feeling so crap to the point I didn't wanted to be a burden to those people. But talks with the supervisors and agreements made (which I, even during the darkest periods kept to) slowly ensured that even when I felt crap, I would show up. I would withdraw myself and avoid social contact and that was accepted by those around me.

This in turn allowed me to feel more comfortable in that environment and it allowed me to open up, first to the supervisors, later to my colleagues and ensured that I at one point was looking forward to go there. I increased the hours I went there and slowly but certainly I gained confidence, being able to joke around with my colleagues.

That said, it wasn't all sunshine and flowers. The moment I left those doors and got home, I was struck with a strong feeling of loneliness and lack of direction. I just spend a morning with people and now I'm back at home, no one to talk to, no one to be with, no one to call without anything to do except sit behind the pc, playing videogames, watching series or movies. The contrast was stark and it caused a lot of confliction within me but at the end of those 3 years of work. I moved on.

The protected work environment was being removed because government lowered the subsidies so it was no longer affordable to maintain. They found a different company that already worked with the municipality and they merged with it. I never found the way they did it great so I made the decision early on in the merging process to quit when it would come. So I did.

**5) The last 1and a half year**

I had high hopes when I left the protected work environment that I would find a job like that. Oh god what was I wrong. I can tell you, I didn't. I would look at job adverts and see the requirement for a diploma or the requirement for relevant work experience and my motivation would drop like a stone in a river.

I have contacted companies, explained what I wanted to do and only two companies actually invited me for a job interview. Neither of those gave me the job. I also hadn't been able to express my mind and the things on my mind since I left the protected work environment, which meant that it started piling up again, lowering my motivation and bringing me to the point I simply wasn't capeable of working, even if I did get a job.

That resulted in me being assigned an ambulatory worker but that didn't work out because there was no connection. I will get a new one in the coming weeks but I can't tell how that will work.

What I can tell you, is that through the confidence I gained during my time in the protected work environment I started up a few things. I found a group for Dungeons and Dragons, I started volunteering at Scouting again, which is something I did pre-depression, I started ballroom dancing, I took swimming classes and starting swimming weekly and I started going to the gym in order to lose weight. I gained 30kg's during my depression because of overeating and little to no movement.

I'm currently doing a course that is a pre-liminary course in order to do a study that focusses on using your mental health experience, and primarily the getting through it, in order to aid people that seek help. I'm not sure if it'll be something for me but it's better than sitting at home.

On the surface, hardly anything has changed. I still spend a metric ton of time playing videogames. I still have days on end where I don't leave the house. I am still anxious to get out of the house, I still feel like not going to the DnD-sessions, Scouting or ballroom dancing but I do see that going helps me. I still lack the confidence that I'll be able to find a job, I still don't feel like I have any friends, let alone close or intimate ones. I still have weeks where I sleep during the day (god that's so fucking nice though) but at the same time.

My mood is stable-ish, despite being reluctant to do new things, I am willing to atleast try them out with an open mind without expectations. I am more vocal than I was before it all went to shit but that doesn't mean I'm out of the woods yet. I know that if I don't have any activities outside the house that it will be easy for me to slip back into a severe depression. I know that there is a long ways to go yet. Now that my depression for the most is in the background, new things came to the surface that prevented me from engaging in healthy relationships in the past which means that I've gotta go and work on that and once that is done, there'll be something new, and after that, something new.

But atleast I can somewhat say, I have the strength to take it by the horns, even if I do avoid it at first and feel like I don't have the strength to do so.

I sincerely hope that my experience will be able to help others on here, seeing as majority of posts are about hopelessness, I want to show that in spite of all that, there is a way out that isn't suicide. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But 7 days of pussy, ps...its my cat.

So...aside from not having checked any of the regular visits I did, not much has happened. Partly because I was ill, partly because didnt think about any of it.

I have some energy more I suppose, I'll find out next wednesday I suppose when I will have some sort of DnD meetup. Not too superexcited about it cuz I'm an introvert yet it will be a better way to spend my time than to sit at home and play videogames.

Curious to see what effect the abstination can have on my confidence. I have ballroom dancing on sunday and theres been this girl that has drawn my attention in the first lesson and I seem to have drawn hers. If I'll be able to confidently look her into the eye I'll call it another victory.

Other then that, had a lovely talk with my consultant from the place that does my welfare, new lady, sounds like a great gal on the phone and actually looking forward to meet her at some point. What else...looking forward to swim again, illness prevented last two weeks but I really wanna nail the breathing in the chestcrawl.

All in all, reasonable first week I guess, had been trying this before I had found nofap but always gave in rather easy but seeing all the good juju here helps I guess.

Good luck ya'll! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Every MBTI-test I done over the past 10 years says INFP yet for I have such insane trouble getting to my feelings and recognising them, let alone be able to act on them.

My mom used to tell me to stop whining whenever there was something and my dad kept telling me to think first, do later. The result is, that despite all thoss tests giving me INFP as a result, I dont feel like an INFP. I'm too analytical in my day to day life overthinking too much in minutiae detail.

Do you guys have any tips to step away from the mind and back into the heart so that thinking will stop being my decision making process and its back to being based on feeling/guts?

Tnx from a 29year old bloke </TEXT>

<TITLE> Question on story placement? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-02-28 00:56:41 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I am writing a trilogy, not so much to get published but more because I want to and if people read it, its a bonus.

So, book 1 I chose to primarily focus on events happening around the protagonist. His being in that part of the world caused some stuff to happen and the focus is on that more than on him. I dunno, seemed like a nicer thing to do.

Last year I started on the 2nd book and this one is about 2 journeys, one physical, the other mental. This is awesome obviously because it gives a lot to play with and the physical journey is already red lined in my head, still havent passed the start of the mental one yet but thats okay.

The question that pops up then is the order of chapters. Most books I have read with multiple storylines switch between characters, that is also how I did it in the first book. However, I was thinking if something akin to the Two Towers/Return of the King would be better.

In those books the focus is completely on a single journey, with the 2nd half of the book being the journey done by the others. Doing that gives the benefit of both becoming seperate stories within a single story and gave me the neat idea to have both covers be the start of each story and then have both meetup in the middle.

So, question; have both storylines interject or treat each storyline as a seperate one like RotK from Tolkien? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, a friend of mine started a debate last night on how T-Rex is a scavenger, knowing it would trigger me, cuz I think its a predator, and starte listing his arguments. I'll put his first then mine.

Pro-scavenger arguments
* Jack Horner said so, but he couldnt say why Jack Horner said so
* Cambridge study claiming T-Rex breaks his bones when trying to run
* T-Rex is sluggish because its cold-blooded like a reptile so can't even hunt
* Its too large to approach anything undetected so has to scavenge

Pro-predator arguments
* Its too large to rely on kills made by other animals. Vultures are only contemporary scavengers and their bodyweight is significantly less than the several tonnes of T-Rex plus their bones are pneumatized so extremely vulnerable.
* Being large requires insane amount of energy to move around, this means a high metabolism which can't be sustained by scavenging
* Bone histology has shown T-Rex grows rapidly; once again requires high amounts of energy, unsustainable through scavenging
* Third digit of the foot is loose, allowing for quick turning, why would a scavenger need to turn quickly (unless its hunting)
* Muscle attachments on the femur are located high up, meaning quick contractions of the leg, meaning high top speed at the cost of stamina
* Bones are supported and strenghtened by muscles
* Overlapping field of vision; ability to see depth
* T-Rex teeth found in healed wounds of hadrosaurs

He then argued that even if T-Rex could run, it wouldnt be quick, to which I answered that it doesnt need to do 30mph. It just needs to be quicker than its prey at which time the conversation got interupted.

So, what do you and current paleontologists say about the state of the debate on T-Rex predator/scavenger? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any looks at sex ads, sexchats porn or erotic stories and my mind is constantly reminding me of moments I could've had sex in the past.

Mind you, I've only had sex a couple of times (29yrs old) and those moments are from a relationship I had when my depression was in full swing behind the scenes.

Is this normal? That it draws my attention to those moments, the longing of sex in past situations where I didnt choose for it.

My brain is saying fuck, in the doing it sense, a bit much since I lay down in bed to sleep and asking my brain who to do brings no answer, as if it turned into Hodor saying only the same thing.

Tldr; do I have to worry about my brain reliving moments of potential sex now that I am abstaining from sexads/porn/sexchats/stories? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Almost 10 years of depression </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-02-24 11:31:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Howdy folks...its been around 10 years now, could be  more, could be less, who knows exactly when it started, and I still have the same old same old surrounding me...

Background; I got depressed during college, hid it with weed, went to Asia for 4 weeks with school, got back with a massive culture shock and pretty much existential crisis, didnt know who I was, what I wanted and all that. Thought I figured it out in a couple months, enter my last year at college (didnt finish it) and autum break: lonely, depressed and just an emotional mess. Fast forward to christmas where I had a nervous breakdown, fast forward to April where I moved to a different city, lost "friends" (spoiler they werent cuz f them) and lo and behold...all alone in a city with no one you know.


Instead of moving back to my parents I decided to stay and went into therapy, had to quit drugs so I did, got told there might be more so big personality test. Being told that I was severely depressed (I actually felt allright that morning, not so much after), schizotypic and needed medication and long term therapy.
I ignored the medication, being sensitive to addiction and such, and got started. First leg of it went allright, my case manager got things done speedily and lots of progress. Then she got fired cuz no money from government and it slowed down.
Still on ny own without friends so I kept tugging their coats, this needs working. New test, this time autism, sure, whatever. Moved teams, got told what autism is, meh, and was given a few courses on communication and thats it...
Great...how about fixing the not being alone and not having friends? No...maybe next I guess...

Throughout it all the same remained; spebding a lot of time at home, playing videogames, not meeting new people. And the few moments I have gone and met new people, I simply couldnt connect to them.

And that is frustrating enough for me to bang my head against the wall for repeatedly till either my head or the wall gives in. The inability to connect to other people...

I see everyone around me do it with ease, or so it seems, yet I can't...am I that different to other people, that indifferent or am I just trying to see something that simply isnt there and I should just accept my hermit life, even if that would push me deeper into depression.

Cuz I'm getting tired of it </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi all, found out about this subreddit due to the negative attention in the media but dam, theres a lot of good juju around here so, knowing I fap to hide things, thought I'd join.

So, long story short is that I got severely depressed during college. 22 years old, lived alone, no job, no college, no people around me.

I started to fap to feel atleast something in that pit of loneliness. I sought sexual activities in order to engage socially. I did this, and to a lesser degree still am, through porn, fantasizing, sexchats, looking at sexual adverts and such. Never really gotten out of the house because once the fap was done, the interest in those things faded quickly.

I have been making some progress, not fapping for a week because there would be no urge, then I would fap and the next couple of weeks I just cant stop till the urges drop again.

Due to my depression I lost all social contact, now 7-8 years onwards I still lack social contact, let alone romantic contact. I also never had a relationship because I was depressed when I had the opportunity to start one, but the fear of showing her my feelings were too strong so I fapped instead of getting it out there.

I guess I'm here to see if this subreddit can help me get through those urges when they arise because of loneliness and should romantic contact be in my future, to then prevent me from fapping my feelings away and instead showing my feelings.

I know its not a porn addiction, but fapping is much larger than porn.

Hope you folks want me around

Tnx </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello fellow people that jot words into sentences and sentences onto paper to then realise that....well....End up with a whole bunch of text that appear to form a story.

I've spend several of the previous years writing a story for the sake of finishing it and story-wise it is finished but there's still a lot of minor mistakes within the writing that would be missed by me due to being a non-native English speaker/writer/listener.

Henceforth, I am looking for a native English (read British) speaker/writer that would like to take a look at my writing to take out the small mistakes that've crept in when I unconciously used my native grammer rules and such.

&#x200B;

I don't know if this is the place to ask or if there's a better place to find an editor since this is my first attempt at it.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to read the replies,

Kind regards,
