<TEXT> Look, I feel like your boyfriend sounds very egoistic. Yesterday I had a pretty bad case of self harm, if someone insensitive had seen it they would have locked me up in a mental institution bc I was acting “crazy”.
My boyfriend was very sad to see how bad I was treating myself and was very concerned and tried his best to make me feel better. When he noticed he wasn’t helping that much he called my therapist for me.
Maybe you’re right that you and your bf are not a good fit, but it’s DEFINITELY not because of you! Mental illnesses are illnesses and we can’t help it. We don’t CHOOSE to be that way and we don’t choose to self harm. I mean you didn’t even remember to have cut yourself. You were not sober at all, it’s not like you consciously chose to do that.
It sounds to me that he was embarrassed and has no clue on how to deal with your illness or even on how to be a good boyfriend.
You are not toxic, you’re aching, honey. You ate being so hard on yourself. Please try to find a free online therapist, i hear there are some around here. I’m so sorry you’re going through this, but you’re not alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He was abusive and toxic but I only realized I had to actually leave him was when I started talking to a friend who was kind, sweet, pro-feminism and it finally hit me that I could and deserved to have all that instead of an overly jealous guy who made me suffer.
Before that, I genuinely thought that was the best I could ever do bc before him I haven’t even kissed someone yet, so I thought nobody else would ever want me. Even if that was true, being single for the rest of my life would have been better than staying in that toxic relationship. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Books on life's unpredictability and how to be ok with things you have no control over </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hey you guys! Hope everyone is doing ok.

I've come to realize, through therapy, that I'm a person who really likes being in control. Not that I like to **control people**, that would be really toxic, but I mean, I like **knowing** things are under control, I like to keep myself up-to-date about what people who matter to me are doing.

For instance, I'm currently living in my parents' house and we've been in quarantine together for the past six months. They're both at high risk with corona, and they are doing everything correctly - wearing masks, cleaning stuff, washing their hands. But I really like to **make sure** that they're doing that, by asking them repeatedly if they did wear a mask while out, if they did wash their hands etc. This is not only annoying to them right now but also I don't know how I'm gonna feel when I move out next month and won't be able to keep track at what they do.

It sound crazy, I know, but my parents mean the world to me, and losing them over something I know I could've helped avoid would crush me to pieces. But here's the thing - they WILL die eventually and I don't know when and how, and I really struggle with this information.

So, do you guys have any tips of books that talk about how to relinquish some control over some aspects of life? Or on how to deal with life's unpredictability? Especially non-fiction books and also not books that tell someone's life or journey. I would prefer if they were on the more practical side of things.

Of course if you know a great book that talks about those topics but are fiction or tell someone's journey you may comment here! I may not read them but that might help someone else!

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don’t judge yourself for having self-harm. We all know why we do it, we have our reasons for doing it at the time we are doing it, even if we regret it afterwards. Some of us need to feel something while feeling numb, others can’t put their feelings into words and those feeling find their ways of being expressed thru self harm. You probably know your reasons and found healthier ways to cope in those ten years with no self harm. Be proud for those years!
So, you said you have the resources to go to a therapist, but yes, the patient and the therapist MUST match. And I agree with you, it is tiring to find one after having to tell a lot of strangers about your life and feelings. But I swear to you: it is worth it.
If tou have the resources for this as well, you could go to a psychiatrist who can assess you in a medical way, see if maybe you’re lacking vitamin d or other things like serotonin and dopamine, so you can feel good enough to start this journey. Sending you love ❤️ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m so sorry you are going through this. Depression is a serious illness and should be seen as such. Of course I can suggest you meditation, reading books, watching silly and meaningless comedies on netflix, but the truth is in you case I don’t think any of these things will fully heal your depression, because it looks like your brain ins unbalanced - maybe it lacks serotonin, dopamine, or who knows, vitamin D! You should consider seeing a doctor - I don’t know if your country has universal healthcare, if not, I don’t know your financial situation. But if you do have the means to see a proper psychiatrist, you should! I used to be just like that, and when I found out the reason to it was the chemical inbalance in my brain and that there was nothing much I could do because we really can’t control those things, I felt somewhat relieved, because at least it didn’t make sense anymore to feel guilty and responsible for that. I started taking medicine and no, it didn’t CURE me, but at least it made me able to get out of my bad, leave my house and then look for the cure itself - I go to therapy, I work, I socialize, etc
The only one thing that’s on the more “holistic” side of things that actually may help you is exercising, because it is proven that physical activities increase dopamine on the brain. But yeah, you have to have a lot of willpower to take that first step and actually exercise. It worth trying, anyway. But really, look for mental health professionals if you can!
Sending u love! ❤️ </TEXT>

For starters, he could have chosen a better environment minister (the one right now spent only 0.4% of the budget on the environment. Thats like 18,000 USD and no I’m not even kidding). The thing is they WANT the Amazon to burn up to make space for farms. Bolsonaro is such a total piece of shit that we could fill out this entire sub only with stuff he poops out of his mouth.

I loved reading that bc I usually doubt self-tests, but this is one I really trust. It’s IS a bit much, but it is so validating! I’m still reading the book but I love how it talks about genetics, bc it means out personality trait isn’t something that’s our fault, we had no choice! Now we must embrace this trait and make the most out of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Old age is TOUGH and quarantine is especially hard on those who are older. Some of them are alone because they are at righer risk so some families don’t visit them not to transmit covid. They are right to do so, but it’s not supposed to be so rigorous. People should call their older parents and their grandparents every single day, and try to visit sometimes with distance and wearing masks.
I don’t know where you’re from, but if she has access to psychiatrists, she should seek treatment, even if it’s with medication. Both my living grandparents take pills. It might seem odd, but it does make a difference. I take meds and I don’t want to keep on taking them for a long time, but it’s doctor prescribed, and they help. But, for older people who don’t have to worry about “the long run”, I think this might be an option, they should be able to live the rest kf their lives as happy as possible.
therapy every week might be dangerous with covid and grandmas aren’t usually tech savvy to have online therapy - but if yours is, forget abt doctors and try therapy first! If she needs medication, the psychologist is going to say it.
Talk to her as much as you can and tell other family members to do that aswell. I hope she gets better ♥️ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m so sorry that the situation is so difficult. I live in a country with universal healthcare, although every other single thing here is terrible so I apologize for having brought doctors up so much, I didn’t think about the financial part and admit that I thought her mother was the one with hospital fear, not her. Sorry, english is not my native language and sometimes I don’t understand everything.
Maybe a therapist is the best way here, I bet there are professionals doing it for free and online, so she could do it at home. I mean, if there are ppl doing that here that’s not a rich country, I guess ppl elsewhere are doing that as well.
I think it’s something almost unavoidable, because you are far away and you get concerned yourself, so having a professional could be good. Also, I don’t think you were wrong to call her sister this time, but I really don’t think it’s the best strategy for other times to come, it should be a last resort if she doesn’t have a good relationship with her... I get along with my family just fine but I’m very proud so even if i love them, when I confess something to my boyfriend only it’s bc I want to keep that between us only. Again, obviously you were worried for her life and you were absolutely right to do that. But if she’s going to have more panic attacks while on social isolation etc (I know I definitely will), having a therapist might be a good plan. Wish you both well. </TEXT>

I’m sure you two can work things out, even if by going to a doctor without her mother knowing, or even making her mother believe in mental illnesses.

I can’t concentrate on work and I don’t feel like doing that because my boss is such an awful person. But then again, when I think that I’m not being the greatest employee, I just think that she’s right when she screams at me. I wish I could leave but she would seek revenge and ruin prospective jobs for me if I left her in the middle of the pandemic.
And even if I was well and loving my job, I live in a country that is so INSANE politically that I can never see myself being happy because of all the injustice towards other people around me. I see no escape, no light, no answer. I’m 100% hopeless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just don’t think you have to demonize taking pills per se. Mental illnesses are exactly that - illnesses, and as such, sometimes pills can help, especially at emergencies, and some medication can be effective treatment. But of course, taking pills with no professional prescription and supervision is awful and deeply concerning. Now that she’s better you should talk to her about seeing a doctor and a therapist.
Maybe you should be more open-minded and not judgmental when talking to her about medication, so she can trust you and open up to you more, and be completely honest about the things she’s taking. That way you’ll be more prepared to deal with these events when you’re far away from each other. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If the first thing he said to you when you finally opened up to him and told him you’ve been struggling was that he needs a more positive girlfriend, then it is you who needs a more supportive one. May I say, a more HUMAN one.
And I feel very sorry for you that then, your first instinct was to come here and ask us how you could be a more positive person. Sure, all of us could use some positivity tips since times are so harsh recently. But you should do it for YOU, not for him.
You really need to prioritize yourself. And remember that there is such a thing as TOXIC POSITIVITY. A positive lifestyle shouldn’t be forced upon someone, it needs to be a long and carefully planned path. It’s ok to feel negative right now. We’re in the middle of a pandemic, lots of us are quarentined, away from loved ones. Some of us even lost loved ones. If you’re not feeling positive it just means that you’re HUMAN, and that you are empathic. And us HSPs feel empathy a lot more than non-HSPs.
Wish you luck. Consider dumping him if this was a pattern behavior (talking about his own needs when you’re trying to express your feelings). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it is your right to be able to talk to your neighbors and solve the noise problems out. They’re being desrespectful. About the smoking, I think you already sought the right solution, but if you can really pressure management or even ask your neighbors around, politely ofc, it would be good. You don’t have to bring up your insomnia or your HSP trait, just say that your asthma is back and that you are really concerned about it because of the coronavirus. I read that there are no published studies confirming that yet, but anyone with good sense can understand someone with a respiratory condition to be worried about a respiratory disease. It doesn’t have to be true for you, it just needs to work. I think self-envolved people may respect a claim like that more than of the one they may think it’s from a “prude” neighbor who doesn’t like smokers and loves to snitch them to managment (really not saying that it’s your case, I’m just trying to think like your narcissistic neighbors might lol).
Meanwhile you could get one of those under door draft stoppers.
I really hope this situation gets better for you. Bad nights of sleep are terrible for our health, having immediate results the next day, especially for HSPs! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Do you guys also notice that you feel good when the sun is out and bad when it is foggy?
‘Cause I feel like the weather practically DICTATES my general mood for the day and it makes me fee so powerless towards my emotions and productivity.
I wonder if it is related to my HSP trait or if it is pure and simple seasonal depression. I didn’t finish reading Dr. Aron’s book yet, so does anyone know?
I also get really anxious when the sun goes down and if you do too, my therapist recommended me to turn on the light right before it happens so I don’t notice it that much, and it works!
I’m just so glad to live in a tropical country with lots of sun, it would be really bad for me to live in the US (maybe only Florida would work) or in Europe! </TEXT>

I also really enjoy meditating to [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BIxOU4wTsSU) mantra.
Yoga and other stretches also work, but unfortunately I’ve been so anxious lately that these things are only helping but not stopping my anxiety... oh!!! And being with my dog! :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, the way you talked about her weight, doesn’t matter if she lost it, could have made her uncomfortable and she may have tried to disguise it with her dark humor.
As a woman, it really annoyed me the way you talked about her belly fat. Girls, especially at that age, can be very sensitive to this kind of comment, because it implies you are actively watching her body in a way to monitor her weight. And I mean, she is old enough to know when her clothes are not fitting and let you know she needs to buy new ones. Weight commenting is never productive.
That being said, she seems like she has an interesting personality, but it looks like she has issues with her father, and I don’t think it has anything to do with the way you and your wife raised her, you seem to be good parents. It is something about their relationship only.
To me, it looks like she does need therapy and that she is so smart she actually fooled the first one with her jokes and didn’t open up to them at all. Maybe look for another professional, bc therapy is so much about the match between the professional and the patient. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don’t actually cry anymore, but angry people do make me anxious.
When I was a child I had a teacher who was a big-time bully. I remember so clearly of a time when she humiliated a girl in our class and all the kids were only like ?!?! and I broke down crying a lot. Even the girl wasn’t crying.
Now I work at a place where there are no walls, just one big room. My extremely toxic boss doesn’t have a room of her own, so there’s a LOT of yelling and scolding going on on a daily basis. I do not cry, but it does kind of ruim my day in a way that I just can’t be really productive.
But you’re really young, OP, and I believe you’ll learn to manage these emotions.
Take a deep breath and remember that it is just a tv show, or if its irl, that it’s not with you and that the person who is getting yelled at may be courageous and bold enough to stand up for themselves. Watch their emotions and their actions so you’ll unconsciously mimic them. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I want kids but worry about breaking them </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-08-06 20:03:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, I’ve always wanted kids. Especifically, I have always wanted to have a girl.
Since I was maybe 16 I thought about adoption, and now that I’m 24 and in a serious relationship, I have really decided that if I’m going to have kids, I am going to adopt a girl.
The thing is that I think I may turn out a terrible mother. I am positive that I’ll worry too much everytime.
Just like many of you guys, I do too think this is a cruel world and it’s going to get worse if nothing ever changes, so putting another human being in the world seems odd and kinda selfish. But, if I’m adopting, I will raise someone who is already out there, no matter if they like it or not, if I like it or not. It’s an already born human in need for caring parents and I could give her a family.
But that doesn’t change the fact the the world and its future is scary. I have always walked around the streets and had unpleasant encounters with catcallers and such, and always stood up for myself. However, being a big sister to a younger woman has me constantly worrying about what she will experience, I’m asking her to take ubers (and sending me the tracker) to avoid walking. When she gets her heart broken, I feel so much for her, and start resenting the person who caused it, even if my sister herself has forgiven them.
I feel like with a daughter these worries be 1000x more intense, and that I’ll try to shield her and be an overly protective, suffocating parent. I’m afraid I won’t allow her to grow up and face her fears (and mine lol). And thus I will eventually “break” a child whose bio-mom thought was being put in better hands.
And that’s what really feels selfish to me, that I would have not only failed the responsibility towards my child but also towards her bio-mom who couldn’t care for her and hoped someone could do it better.
Any advice? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eu acho que vc precisa com certeza sentar e conversar com eles sobre isso. Quem ama seu filho, quem cuida do seu filho, merece seu amor também, ou, no mínimo, seu respeito.
Diga que vocês não estão fazendo nada de mais. Pergunta se eles prefeririam que você fosse à casa dele, ficasse lá onde eles não podem te ver. Com certeza é mais seguro que você fique na sua casa.
Mas um relato pessoal: minha mãe também tratava meu primeiro namorado muito mal, eu tb tinha 16 anos e ele tinha 21, ou seja, eu adolescente e ele um homem que já trabalhava. Ela não gostava dele. Só que no fim, ela tava certa. Ele era um paspalho e só me fazia mal, era uma situação abusiva, com perseguição virtual e na vida real. Quando minha mãe me via chorando por causa dele, ela tomava minhas dores e tratava ele mal.
Compreensível.
Olha, pode com certeza não ser o caso, e se você fosse uma pessoa mais velha eu nem teria te falado isso, mas por ser ainda muito jovem eu acho que vc tem que perguntar o motivo deles tratarem ele assim, se é ciúme puro ou se é um problema especificamente com ele, sabe? Por você ser muito jovem ainda (eu nao me achava nova aos 16, agora eu acho que eu era mesmo muito nova) pode ser que eles estejam tentando te proteger.
Mas pode ser que não, claro! E tem muitas maneiras de proteger sem fazer você passar vergonha ou criar situações difíceis com ele. Com certeza eles não tomaram uma decisão sábia. E claro, se você fosse mais velha, seria totalmente inaceitável. </TEXT>

Sim, são dois pesos e duas medidas e não, não quer dizer que pq um homem específico vai ficar sussa com um nude vazado só pq em geral são as mulheres que mais sofrem nesses casos, e tb nao justifica as pessoas ridicularizarem o tamanho.

<TEXT> I'm really interested in online safety but I'm actually really dumb when it comes to technology. I've been playing a lot of animal crossing while on quarantine which means I search Animal Crossing all the time. But, today I searched the term "native fruits" in hopes to learn more about where does each \[real life\] fruit comes from and most of the results were animal crossing related because we do have fruits that are native to our islands. But I really don't think that the millions of ac players out there are enough to have changed the results for a term as common as FRUIT... so it must've gotten it from my search history and browsed websites.

I just miss browsing the web and having unfiltered results, with no algorithms that \*think\* they know what I'm looking for when they actually don't :( </TEXT>

Talvez você possa procurar grupos de apoio anônimos. Aqui no reddit deve ter algum. Mesmo que seja apenas pra ficar lendo, às vezes ler o que pessoas com experiências similares fizeram já pode te fazer bem. Mas só você sabe deve fazer a partir de agora, respeitando seus próprios limites, avaliando quanto essa história ainda repercute na sua vida, se muito ou pouco.
O que importa é que você foi vítima de algo ruim quando era ainda uma criança, não tem culpa do que aconteceu e não tem responsabilidade sobre o que um rapaz/homem fez ou pode fazer, pelo menos não agora que faz pouco tempo que entendeu tudo. Foque no seu próprio autocuidado agora, vai ser algo essencial.

<TEXT> Você faz terapia? Vai ao psiquiatra? Toma algum remédio? Pelo visto em algum momento um profissional qualificado te diagnosticou, mas você seguiu com o tratamento?
Aprendi nos últimos anos que a maior forma de autocuidado é o tratamento ao lado de profissionais de saúde mental. E que se um deles me diz que eu preciso tomar remédios, tudo bem.
Doenças mentais são isso: doença, patologia. Como uma gripe, como uma infecção. Você toma remédios para se curar ou pelo menos para aliviar os sintomas. E tudo bem!
Eu tomo remédio ha tres anos e faço terapia. Os remédios são a muleta que eu preciso para que minha mente esteja equilibrada o suficiente para que assim eu possa tomar meus passos rumo ao aperfeiçoamento pessoal.
Tem outras coisas que podem te ajudar: música calma, meditaçao, alongamento, respiração consciente...
Pra mim o que mais ajuda a ficar quieta e pensar em nada é assistir vídeo de gente espremendo cravos. Podem me julgar e achar nojento, mas é muito tranquilizante seja la qual o motivo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Você não precisa se sentir pressionado a falar para ninguém nem a denunciar nesse primeiro momento. É algo que você guardou por muito tempo, que te causou dor física imediata e que com certeza um certo trauma. Você não é responsável pelo que te aconteceu, não é responsável pelo que seus pais vão sentir, não é responsável pela atitude de seu primo como pai. A responsabilidade é toda dele, que já era grande, e dos pais dele que não o ensinaram direito.
Você era uma criança indefesa, não pode se culpar por isso e nem se cobrar imediatamente de nenhuma atitude só porque agora é adulto... você segue carregando esse trauma e junto dee o fardo de um segredo. Não é fácil, se orgulhe disso.
Mas te aconselho fortemente a buscar a terapia. Um psicólogo de confiança, seja homem ou mulher. Faça várias primeiras consultas, com vários profissionais, até que você encontre alguém com quem você se sinta plenamente à vontade para falar sobre isso. Não tem problema mudar de psicólogo, mas é muito importante que você encontre um de confiança, para trabalhar esse trauma, no impacto que ele pode ainda ter na sua vida, se livrar de gatilhos...
Fica bem! Sinto muito que tenha passado por isso. A culpa não é sua. </TEXT>

<TEXT> É capaz que o batimento rápido seja ansiedade, mas fazer atividade física é bom pra isso também, libera dopamina e seratonina, faz dormir melhor... eu acho que você precisa fazer exercícios que sejam fáceis e divertidos, como os do wii mesmo, e acho que o segredo para você persistir neles é realmente não começar com coisas pesadas como os maromba do youtube mesmo, assim vc só vai ficar desestimulado e com preguiça. Não pode se cobrar muito, principalmente na pandemia. Se vc tem switch a nintendo fez aquele ring que parece ser muito legal! Eu queria ter. Recomendo também o just dance, eu amo, mas como vc é menino imagino que possa nao ser sua praia, mas de fato quando vc ganha pontos e tem gamificação envolvida, é mais fácil ficar animado pra fazer kk mas sei la baixa a versao do celular que é de graça, vai que vc desenvolve uma habilidade desconhecida </TEXT>

Se não for sua vibe, vai atrás de entender seus direitos, se vcs eram casados no papel, dependendo do regime de comunhão de bens eu imagino que vc possa reaver os livros pq é capaz que entre no mesmo esquema do que qualquer outra posse.

<TEXT> Totalmente. Esse tipo de coisa só serve ao capitalismo. Faz as pessoas se sentirem culpadas e impelidas a trabalhar e usar o salario ganhado com produtos que fingem que vão “te curar”. Agora você faz uma máscara na cara e passa cremes e é autocuidado e não consumismo e pressão estética. Nada contra mascara, tb faço, mas autocuidado é ir na terapia toda semana, é sentir suas emoções, por tudo na balança pra ver o que faz bem e faz sentido. Claro, nem tudo é um mar de flores, nós temos que ter nossas responsabilidades - mas agora não é, nem de longe, o momento de se cobrar sobre isso e, muito menos, de cobrar os outros! É uma pandemia mundial em meio a ascensão de governos autoritários. Não é bolinho. </TEXT>

Procure fazer coisas que te tiram da ansiedade também, que deixam sua cabeça ocupada. Um filme fantástico, séries, videogame... Não tem problema nenhum esse escape em momentos de crise - é autopreservação.

Segundo: se afaste das notícias. Só deixa a ansiedade pior. Se afaste de qualquer rede social que tenha notícias, twitter, reddit, facebook... me ajudou MUITO.
Terceiro: você precisa mesmo de ajuda psicológica. Ideação suicida é algo sério e precisa de acompanhamento psicológico. Muitos psicólogos estão fazendo trabalho voluntário durante a pandemia justamente pq tem muita gente mal. Procure ir atrás, eles estão atendendo de graça e por skype. Vc deve encontrar em grupo de facebook.

Acho que é necessário que ambos invistam em proporcionar experiências novas um ao outro. Mas como você é quem está incomodado, seja você o primeiro a fazer algo pra ela, ela provavelmente mais querer retribuir. Daí vocês vão criando esse hábito de sempre tentar inovar.  Pode ser na cama, pode ser criando novos hobbys juntos, dando presentes inesperados, ficar bêbados ou chapados juntos para ver um filme.
Pode ser fazendo planos para o futuro - vocês ja namoram há muito tempo, já moram juntos? Se não, pode ser muito legal pensar juntos numa casinha de vocês. Se já moram, pensam em casar? Se não, podem planejar uma grande viagem.
Enfim, acho que tem uma infinidade de coisas e por mais bobo que vc vá se sentir ao pesquisar isso no google, tem umas ideias boas que vc pode encontrar kk </TEXT>

<TEXT> Você ficou mal como? Tente usar como comparativo o modo como vc se sentia antes da terapia e dos remédios. Se chegou perto, você precisa marcar o psiquiatra para ajustar seus remédios. É muito difícil ajustar a dose e o medicamento correto, pode ser que não seja seu tratamento ideal. Se você não estiver mais fazendo terapia, retorne.
E não se sinta mal por ter ficado mal. Nem mesmo se culpe. Não existe isso de “cair em gatilho”. O gatilho que te dispara, nao o oposto. Não se culpe. E no momento em que estamos, no mundo em que vivemos, é normal ficar mal. Significa que você é humano, que você tem emoções, que você está vivo.

Eu fiz cinema e as respostas que eu tenho ao dizer isso ou são de decepção tipo “nossa a hiponga que vai ser pobre” ou muita animação porque as pessoas acham que eu vou ser atriz kk
Ninguém nunca vai sentir o que vc sente por algo, então as respostas dos outros nunca vão ser satisfatórias. Mas a graça é mesmo que não importa o que eles pensam, quem está vivendo sua vida é vc e nao eles, e vc nao precisa da aprovação de ninguém pra fazer isso.
Mas acho que vc precisa de um elogio, pq todos precisamos vez em quando, então fica aqui meus parabéns por fazer um curso mega legal e mega difícil.
Agora, vc disse “claro que se imaginava fazendo outra coisa”. Parece que não era a primeira opção.
Você se arrepende de ter escolhido letras?
Se vc acha que ainda pode se apaixonar pelo curso, insista. Tem muitas matérias que serão úteis na sua vida, assim como um diploma. Se vc decidir fazer direito, com certeza vai poder eliminar muitas disciplinas no início.
Mas dê um pouco de tempo para ver como vc se sente com tudo isso. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eu também já vivi um relacionamento abusivo. É uma bosta. Não houve traição, por isso acho que foi meio demorado decidir sair. Quando a gente ta numa relação tóxica, nossos pensamentos são poluída e manipulados, a gente não pensa direito. Não vê que está numa relação ruim. Veja sua situação por esse lado: você agora consegue ver com clareza o quão abusiva era sua relação e ele deixou ainda mais claro que ele é um escroto ao trair você.
Ele não te merecia quando vcs estavam juntos e agora que estão separados merece ainda menos qualquer lágrima, pensamento, e menos ainda um suicidio.
Não sei se você tem esses pensamentos por querer atingir ele de alguma forma, fazer ele sofrer pela sua morta - não tem problema se for, todo mundo pensa assim vez ou outra. Mas serio, qual seria a graça dessa vingança se vc nao vai estar viva pra saborear? A melhor vingança vai ser você continuar viva, gata, inteligente, e arranjar alguém digno do seu amor.
Agora, se vc nao ve mais sentido na vida mesmo, seja por ter se machucado muito ou por ter receio de estar solteira ou sozinha, tenho um relato pessoal pra vc. A MELHOR coisa que me aconteceu foi o fim do meu relacionamento abusivo. Me libertar daquele ciúme doentio, estar livre para receber o amor de varias pessoas, seja das minhas amigas, seja da minha família, seja de outros caras... estar livre daquela possessão. Te juro que não vale a pena ir embora agora porque é agora mesmo que vai vir coisa boa. Você não consegue ver isso nesse momento porque seus pensamentos ainda estão contaminados pela relação.
Te recomendo fazer terapia, porque pensamento suicida é coisa séria e precisa ser acompanhado por um profissional. Eu só estou viva por conta do acompanhamento psicológico e psiquiatrico, e fico muito feliz por ter ficado por aqui, persistido. </TEXT>

Homem que bate em mulher é um cu mesmo, sinto muitíssimo que você tenha presenciado isso e vivido com um homem assim por perto. Sei como é tentar consertar seus pais através de discussões, mas alguns não têm conserto. Sua energia é valiosa demais para ser gasta nisso, e mesmo ainda em desejar a morte dele.
Tente focar em sua dependência financeira para que possa sair de casa e viver sua vida. Use sua energia para alimentar esse sonho.

<TEXT> Hello everyone :)
So I have too many recipes lying around and wish to trade them for ones I don't have yet. We can trade 1:1.

[These](https://villagerdb.com/user/thisbone/list/extras-diy) are my spare DIYs and [this](https://villagerdb.com/user/thisbone/list/diy-wishlist) is my wishlist (but you can make an offer if you really want something and don't have anything on the list).

<TEXT> É... matemática era meu pânico também. Siga tentando estudar o que gosta, mesmo que nao consiga, valorize sua tentativa.
Sobre terapia, é essencial um encaixe entre paciente e terapeuta, além da linha que ele segue. Geralmente depressão em casos de crise a linha que costuma ajudar mais é a comportamental. Não tenha medo de ir mudando de terapeuta, tente encontrar um que seja o mais adequado a vc. É muito importante </TEXT>

<TEXT> Olha, sobre você achar que as pessoas bagunçando tudo por conta do rapaz assassinado ser exagero, acho que tem a ver com ser adolescente mesmo. Bizarro mesmo é um homem negro inocente ser assassinado em plena luz do dia no centro da cidade, e a polícia ser tão abertamente racista que o policial não hesitou em nenhum momento em assassinar, crente que suas ações não teriam consequências, como nunca têm mesmo.
A violência é, infelizmente, a unica maneira de fazer o estado perceber que não pode seguir assim. O amor e a calma não funcionaram. É triste, mas é a realidade.
Por mim podia queimar vários predios aqui do Brasil se isso garantisse fim ao genocídio do povo negro. Para mim vale mil vezes mais a vida de crianças negras do que qualquer prédio do Niemeyer.
Não sei muito como te deixar calmo pq o mundo sempre foi uma bagunça. A diferença é que agora cada baguncinha é noticiada por segundo, com texto, com imagem, com vídeo.
Se isso te deixa mal e ansioso, recomendo se afastar das notícias e das redes sociais, que foi o que eu tenho feito. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oi! Então, pelo que eu li você tem muitas questões passando pela cabeça agora e digo desde já que algumas delas devem ser tratadas num psicólogo. Existem psicólogas atentendo gratuitamente e via skype durante a pandemia. Vá atrás.
Agora conselhos meus... não se cobre tanto durante a pandemia. É meio que sem precedentes a maneira como ela tem acontecido agora... Sinto que você está bastante ansiosa e isso pode já ser um traço seu ou ainda uma patologia (eu tenho depressão por exemplo e é mesmo uma doença, faço terapia e tomo remédio. Por isso insisto na questão da terapia para você), mas independente disso, todo mundo ta ansioso e disperso durante a pandemia. Não compare o que vc ta vivendo com fantasias que você cria do que as outras pessoas mega-focadas estão fazendo. Ninguém ta normal, te garanto.
Mas acho que você precisa se distrair com outras coisas que não redes sociais. Sério. Evite redes sociais neste momento, você só vai ficar mais ansiosa e não vai ter nada que vc vai poder fazer para mudar nada no mundo neste exato momento entao não tem motivo.
Respira fundo. Sei que vai ser o conseho ao contrário do que todos os professores de cursinho dão, mas para a pandemia to achando necessário: estude suas matérias favoritas. Foca nelas. Esquece as que você não vai muito bem agora. Comece pelo que você gosta, o sentimento de aprendizado vai ser incrível e vai ser um motor de confiança para depois você atacar as que você precisa de mais força. E você nao vai poder se sentir mal, pq suas matérias favoritas tb caem no enem, então vc vai estar cumprindo a obrigação. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Você não pode se sentir mal por estar fraca e desinteressada. É sinal de que você é humana e tem empatia.
Para humanos empáticos, é natural um esgotamento emocional levar a uma brusca queda na produtividade quando milhares de pessoas estão morrendo, quando se mora num país no qual o presidente não valoriza ensino superior, é genocida e autoritário.
É normal se distrair da faculdade quando o mundo ta pegando fogo lá fora.
Se você acha que ia se sentir pior trancando a faculdade, siga fazendo, dê o melhor que você puder para este momento, tendo em mente que seu melhor agora vai ser sim pior do que o seu melhor de sempre, porque estamos numa situação muito adversa. Se vier nota ruim, paciência, você sabe que teria ido muito melhor se o mundo não fosse tão lixo, se a vida de muitos não estivesse em risco.
Não se compare com os outros. Cada um tem seu nível de sensibilidade, o seu deve ser alto assim como o meu é, e eu tenho muito orgulho de ser sensível porque cada dia eu vejo mais que é um dos traços mais raros nas pessoas hoje em dia. Fique bem ❤️ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Eu passei por isso. Na minha escola no interior eu era uma das melhores alunas sem nem fazer lição. No ensino médio fui para uma escola em outra cidade que dividia os alunos em salas de acordo com a nota kkkk só em um trimestre fiquei na dos “inteligentes”.
É normal, o mundo é gigante. Mas essa mania nossa de nos compararmos com os outros só nos prejudica.
Função de segundo grau só é importante para o vestibular e se você for estudar exatas. Não crisa com isso, sério. Estabeleça objetivos para sua via de curto, médio e longo prazos e compare sua trajetória apenas com esses objetivos e não com a trajetória dos outros.
Hoje em dia tem tanto video ensinando matemática, às vezes se vc der uma olhada vc encontra alguém que te faça entender. Cada professor tem uma didática e cada um tem um jeito de entender. Eu não tinha isso na minha época, acho que vcs que têm podem aproveitar.
Mas a verdade é que no meio da pandemia essa não é mesmo a hora de se estressar com equação. Acho que se eu tivesse na escola ou na faculdade durante a pandemia, ia tentar me focar nas matérias que já são meu forte mesmo, para não me sentir mal, e porque eu ia aprender bastante e solidificar esse conhecimento que vai ser de fato o essencial pro seu futuro (assimindo que você vai escolher uma carreira baseada nos seus gostos mesmo). Se frustrar agora é muito perigoso e contra-producente, e nao há nada de errado em escolher um foco agora. Não podemos ter imunidade baixa e estresse agora abaixa a imunidade.
Não há nada de errado em priorizar seus pontos fortes, especialmente durante essa pandemia nunca antes vista. Ainda mais agora que além da pandemia estamos sendo distraídos com acontecimentos políticos importantes mundo afora. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Você conhece a Alexandra, do alexandrismos no insta? Ela aborda muito isso com relação à gordofobia e pressão estética. E ela, apesar de ser bonita, não se encaixa nos padrões de beleza e viralizou por conta da qualidade do conteúdo dela :)
Agora, se tem uma coisa que não vou conseguir fazer para te deixar mais calma é mudar a realidade. É verdade que pessoas bonitas têm as coisas MUITO FÁCIL nas redes sociais, e isso dá uma puta raiva do caralho, eu tenho muita raiva disso. Mas existem inúmeros exemplos de gente não necessariamente bonitas que fazem sucesso. Por motivos óbvios muito mais exemplos de homens feios que fazem sucesso do que de mulheres, mas existem mulheres fora do padrão sendo influencers sim! A própria Kéfera, a Lele Pons, não eram tão "bonitas" e fizeram sucesso, e depois fizeram plástica (coisa que não era necessário).
Planeje uma estética bem bacana pros seus vídeos que não dependa de você tentar ver erros no seu rosto ou seu corpo, como uma identidade visual, um design bonito... assim você consegue apelar pro lado estético do público e ao mesmo tempo ainda já cria sua "marca" na internet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mas esse rolê das redes sociais é muito diferente de uma prova. A prova tem sei lá, 5 questões sobre uma matéria que você sabe que vai cair etc. As redes sociais você não só tem todo o conteúdo que tem que fazer como o jeito que eles vão medir é MUITO mais complexo do que um professor dando certo e errado nas questões.
Cada rede tem um algoritmo e de verdade, ninguém sabe exatamente como funciona, por isso mesmo tem gente, como o rapaz acima, com uma carreira inteira dedicada a estudar isso, e sempre tem que se atualizar. E o resultado não sai nem todo de uma vez como uma nota 10, os views vão saindo durante dias, semanas, meses... você não pode desistir agora porque nem sabe o resultado real.
Mas meu conselho pra você é fazer uma lista de tudo o que deu certo na sua vida e tudo o que você gosta em você. Basicamente uma lista positiva. Parece a maior bobagem da TERRA mas funciona. Você vai achar que não tem nada pra listar mas quando lembrar de uma coisa, já vai lembrando de outra. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Procura ajuda psicológica, terapia. Tem auxílio gratuito e online agora. Parece ser uma situação muito complicada para procurar conselhos numa rede social de estranhos que não te conhecem e não são treinados para isso. O que eu posso dizer é: fica no seu canto, se acalma, faça coisas que te deixem bem. É péssimo ter uma relação abusiva com um parente mais velho, e sei como é ruim quando você, vítima, finalmente põe pra fora, as pessoas passam a te acalmar como se você fosse um grande instaurador do caos quando na verdade você guardou muita mágoa dele por muito tempo. A família brasileira gosta muito de manter as aparências ao invés de resolver as diferenças de forma eficiente, e qualquer coisa que abale isso já deixa todo mundo incomodado. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aborto não é simples, não é uma decisão fácil, é cheia de tabus, é doloroso e marca para a vida toda. Sugiro que você leia alguns relatos sobre isso. Acho incrivelmente difícil as pessoas usarem aborto como anticoncepcional - mas anticoncepcional segue tendo falhas, todos eles, e a responsabilidade sobre ele recai para a mulher na enorme maioria das vezes. De todo modo, com certeza você tem razão de que a liberação do direito de abortar (regulamentado em meses) deve, necessariamente, vir acompanhada de uma enorme campanha de conscientização. Infelizmente nem um nem outro virão muito brevemente no Brasil, visto que educação sexual é visto como algo feito por pedófilos, quando na verdade é o oposto disso, ajuda muito a reconhecer abusos sexuais na infância. E acho muito válido que toda família tenha o direito a atendimento psicológico gratuito, seria a melhor coisa da vida toda! Desculpa se fui simplista na resposta, mas vc só postou uma notícia ruim e foi a primeira coisa que eu pensei, porque não tem muito o que falar né, é uma bosta esse tipo de notícia mesmo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aliás, OP, eu vi que você postou sobre o assunto em inúmeros outros subs e o consenso parece ser que realmente não é uma boa ideia você seguir com ele. Tem um post que tem mais de 300 comentários falando meio que isso, sabe? Você inclusive comentou numa sub de estupro, o que acho até meio insensível pelas vítimas que tem lá.
Mas enfim, sigo achando triste que seus amigos não sacaram a complexidade de sentimentos que você tem, e é lamentável que vários estranhos que você nunca nem viu sejam as pessoas que estejam te aconselhando e não seus amigos, mas estamos aconselhando acho que com muito respeito mesmo, e sinto muito mesmo que você esteja passando por isso.
Não é fácil terminar um namoro, acho que você está querendo achar um motivo para ficar com ele e postando em vários lugares, mas não está encontrando esse motivo, o que diz muito. Mas por favor, pense em si mesma, você tá pensando muito no lado dele, pouco do na moça e pouco no seu! É muito bom se sentir amada e ter companhia, mas será que a companhia de um estuprador que aparentemente nunca nem pediu desculpas para a vítima é a companhia que você quer? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ah, sim. É que a gente não tá num grupo muitoo feminista né, quis ser meio didática, geralmente sou bem agressiva, rs. É foda porque a gente não tem quase nenhuma informação sobre o caso do estupro em si, por isso eu fui muuuuito ampla para não ser grossa com a OP, no sentido de não dar a entender que ela está necessariamente errada por ter entrado em dúvidas ao invés de ter terminado logo de cara. Tem gente que perdoa estupro, tipo a moça vítima do Polanski - mas ela era tipo menor de idade e ele drogou ela, então eu não dou a mínima se ela desculpou, ele segue sendo um imbecil nojento. Mas sim, quanto mais penso mais acho que ela tem que terminar pq to convencida de que o cara não se desculpou nunca com a vítima, chorou pq achava que nunca seria pego e infelizmente sobrou pra menina (OP) a primeira possibilidade de punição que ele vai ter, o que é foda, mas pensando agora eu realmente acho que se fosse comigo, eu daria sim essa punição.

<TEXT> Eu sinto muito que você esteja passando por isso. De verdade isso não deve ser nada fácil, é um assunto complexo e entendo totalmente os dois lados que você está enfrentando, sou feminista ferrenha, também e não sei o que eu faria se soubesse que meu namorado já estuprou alguém. Eu não sei o que dizer, nunca passei por nenhuma das duas coisas. Você conversou com a menina que foi de fato a vítima sobre isso? Ela te disse algo sobre esperar alguma coisa da sua parte como um término ou ela te contou para te alertar? Ela chegou a perdoar ele?Vou te falar o que eu faria, tá? Mas não acho que seja necessariamente o certo.
Quando eu namorava meu ex abusivo, mesmo nos momentos "lua-de-mel" do ciclo de abuso, mesmo apaixonada, eu sabia que ele não era a pessoa com quem eu ia casar, mas eu gostava de estar com ele, era uma companhia.O que eu quero dizer é: você sente uma conexão extremamente profunda com seu namorado ou ele é apenas uma boa companhia? Você acha que ele tem potencial para ser quem vai te acompanhar para o resto da vida (mesmo que você não acredite nisso, pense no potencial). Você acha que ele vale a pena a ponto de por em cheque seus valores? Além disso, tem que avaliar mesmo como ele é com você, se não há nenhuma pulga atrás da orelha.
Sabe, não acho que seu namorado deva pagar **para sempre** pelo erro que ele cometeu quando não estava em estado sóbrio e pelo qual se arrependeu, mas também **não acho que estupradores devam sair impunes**. Depende muito de como foi, do que a menina sentiu, se foi um enorme trauma que a despedaçou... se foi denunciado, se mais gente sabe. Porque se essa é a primeira vez que ele é confrontado com essa verdade e é a primeira vez que ele é "punido", de fato infelizmente recaiu sobre você uma responsabilidade moral que não devia recair sobre ninguém além dele. Porque ele deve, sim, ser punido de alguma forma.
E fico extremamente triste com suas colegas e seus amigos por te deixarem sozinha nesse momento difícil. Você nem tomou uma decisão final ainda, pelo que entendi, certo? Você decidiu continuar mas não parece tão convicta. Ao meu ver parece que você ainda quer pensar, afinal você pensou por apenas dois dias e continuou para não perdê-lo de cara. Pense mais, e tente falar com seus amigos, peça para que eles se coloquem no seu lugar. Não foi você quem estuprou, porque você é quem tem que ficar sem amigos? Você não é policial nem tampouco iniciou o romance já sabendo o que seu namorado fez, assim como **ninguém sabe nem nunca pode ter certeza do que o namorado fez**. É muito recente isso pra você e seus amigos precisam entender isso e conversar com você com argumentos ao invés de virar a cara direto. Se foi algo realmente horroroso e traumático, eu não conseguiria seguir o namoro. Aliás, acho que eu mesma não conseguiria mesmo se não tivesse sido traumático, eu sou muito fervorosa e ponho muita fé na sororidade, mas eu realmente não sei como foi, não sei da sua relação com o rapaz, não sei da sua relação com a vítima...
Mas sabe, sério, esse cara tem que valer mesmo MUITO MAS MUITO A PENA, e infelizmente, pensando agora (até editei a resposta depois de ver outras), acho muito difícil que um namorado que já estuprou alguém valha tudo isso. Não impossível, vai, mas muito difícil. Você diz que ele mudou, mas ele chegou ao menos a se desculpar com a vítima dele? Porque se ele nem ao menos mostrou o arrependimento a ela, sinto muito, mas ele não mudou nem se arrependeu, só está mesmo é com medo de perder você. </TEXT>

E, sei lá, você não devia estar escrevendo sobre isso no reddit e sim conversando com ela sobre isso. Porque um bando de gente que vc nem conhece deu sua própria opinião não quer dizer que ela pensa o mesmo, e nada do que vc tirar daqui a partir dessa pergunta vai ser bom pra sua relação. Se você não gosta mais dela, termina. Se você acha ela ciumenta demais, converse com ela, ué. A resposta não tá aqui não. E para cada pergunta que vc fez, imagine como vc se sentiria se fosse ela quem tivesse feito, e não vc. E se pergunte se vc ia gostar dela fazer essas perguntas pra um monte de estranho e pautar o que deve ou não ser feito no relacionamento de vocês com base na estrutura moral desses estranhos. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Assiste novela, o vocabulário é mais simples e os sotaques são mais homogêneos! Avenida Brasil é imperdível, eu amava também Chocolate com Pimenta.
De filmes, nossa cinematografia é maravilhosa. Para começar pode ser a série de filmes “Minha Mãe é uma Peça”, e “Que horas ela volta” e quando se sentir segura pode assistir aos melhores filmes. Cidade de Deus é bom como filme mas dá uma imagem ruim ao Brasil, ao passo que é um tanto racista. Recomendo: Carandiru, O Beijo da Mulher Aranha, Bacurau, Dona Flor e seus dois maridos (baseado em livro, pode ler também!), A Hora da Estrela (dirigido por mulher, baseado em livro da Clarice Lispector que você PRECISA conhecer), Bicho de Sete Cabeças... Temos ótimos documentários, como os filmes do Eduardo Coutinho (Edifício Master, Cabra Marcado para morrer).
Os melhores filmes são das décadas de 60-70 (Glauber Rocha), mas o som dos filmes era muito ruim então ficaria mais difícil para você ver agora. Mas veja um dia, o cara era um gênio e previu muito do que o país passou e passa. </TEXT>

"mulheres *terem vários* aos seus pés e possuírem o poder de escolha." Quando vc chegar nisso, aí sim você não vai namorar ninguém, porque mulher nenhuma vai querer alguém que as odeia.

Tipo sério em que mundo você vive que todas as mulheres tem poder de escolha? Ta maluco? Ta cheio de homem controlando mulher financeiramente ou pela força física. E o que eu mais vivi na minha adolescencia era nenhum menino querendo me beijar, e conheço muitas meninas bonitas que demoraram para beijar também.

<TEXT> Acho que você devia falar sobre isso com ele. Pode ser isso? Pode, mas acho extremamente improvável que alguém escolha estar com outra pessoa apenas por um único motivo, ainda mais esse. Ainda mais sendo homem, porque homem é criado geralmente para ser o pegador, a sociedade em geral os vê como os mais incríveis e maiorais, então acho um pouco mais difícil um homem namorar com alguém sem querer do que uma mulher.
Agora, sobre a traição no outro relacionamento como o evento fundador do relacionamento de vocês, acho que apesar de haver uma questão de lógica mesmo - o relacionamento deles teria de ter terminado para o de vocês começarem, também não acho que é a maneira correta e saudável de se pensar. Primeiro porque nada garante que eles teriam ficado juntos pelo resto da vida deles não fosse a traição, segundo porque se eles fossem perfeitos um pro outro mesmo às vezes até teria rolado perdão (tipo, eu e meu namorado nos vemos como metade da laranja, mas cada um por seu motivo traiu bem no comecinho e ambos perdoaram).
Terceiro que **todo** relacionamento necessariamente precisa dessa relação lógica de disponibilidade. Eu só estou com meu namorado porque eu terminei com meu relacionamento abusivo anterior e porque uma mina que ele era apaixonado não sentia o mesmo. Mas esse não é o **motivo** pelo qual ficamos juntos, e sim porque nos amamos, como imagino que seja o caso de vocês também :) </TEXT>

Pra que então entrar nessa pira? Homem sempre busca controlar mulher pelo dinheiro. Eu sei, eu já vivi e não foi só uma vez.Segundo que se ela trabalha e ganha um salário fruto do esforço exclusivo dela, o que o namorado tem a ver com o que ela gasta?Acho certo uma pessoa gastar 80% do salário com droga? Não. Mas como ele vai saber disso? Como ele vai fazer esse cálculo? Vai ficar requisitando relatórios mensais de ganhos e gastos pra menina? Não só é patético como é contraproducente. É um relacionamento cara, o que importa não é o investimento da outra pessoa, é se o relacionamento funciona ou não.Não importa o gasto, importa única e exclusivamente se esse hábito incomoda ou não. E tipo, nesse caso literalmente se ela simplesmente não tivesse falado pra ele, ele nem saberia! Eles seguiriam tendo essa química forte de casal e de amizade. Pra mim ta bem claro que essa menina não tem problema com droga, ao menos não neste momento. </TEXT>

Por favor, procure ajuda profissional, porque pode muito bem ser o caso - como é o meu caso. Procure um terapeuta. Adolescência pode ser muito ruim mas nossa, a partir dos 20 anos que é quando vc pensa em ir, tudo fica MUITO BOM. Te prometo!! É tipo você ainda é novo e tem aquela beleza de gente jovem mas está mais seguro de si e começa a encontrar amigos com mais interesses em comum.
E esse negócio da rejeição da namorada, meu deus, se eu já tivesse namorado com 14 anos eu tava realizada. Fui beijar com 16 só, me sentia péssima hahahha
Sobre seus primos te chamarem, sério, o que importa se você não sabe o que eles gostam em você, o que você faz etc? O mais importante já tá acontecendo, cara, que é eles quererem sua presença! Isso já basta, não se preocupe com o motivo, contente-se em se sentir querido. O motivo existe para eles, e você ainda vai ter tempo para descobrir qual é por si mesmo.

<TEXT> Eu acho que a questão nesse caso nunca é a droga em si, mas o que a pessoa está passando para buscar um escape nessa droga. Sabe, eu não fico puta com mendigo que usa a grana da esmola para tomar pinga e usar crack, eu tenho pena porque a vida deles é uma merda mesmo e eu também não conseguiria passar por certas dificuldades sóbria. O problema não é a droga em si, mas a falta de terapia, aconselhamento e orientação profissional correta. Falando mesmo da maconha em si que comprovadamente é segura. Outras drogas são problemáticas sim.
O que eu quero dizer não é que o ex da tua prima tava certo e é um coitadinho, ele é um canalha. Mas é que pra homem não há estigma nenhum em largar mulher com filho né?

Primeiro que eles são namorados e o dinheiro é DELA e ela tem total direito de gastar com o que ela bem entender, assim como tem gente que gasta uma puta grana com videogame e hardware sem ser gamer profissional, sabe?

Segundo que quanto mais cara a maconha, melhor a qualidade e menor a possibilidade de dar algum ruim, por ser pura, por não estar misturada com amônia e outras coisas. Gastar 600 reais no mês com maconha boa aqui onde eu moro dá tipo 5g, o que não é NADA. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Acho que o relacionamento de vocês é muito maior que este problema, e parece ser um relacionamento muito bom e seria bobo e uma pena mesmo você terminar por causa de algo pequeno sem antes conversar honestamente com ela.

Sobre maconha: Olha, minha família sempre demonizou bebida e drogas, ainda mais com meus pais tendo apenas duas filhas mulheres. Eu também julgava muito, até experimentar. Ela causa muito menos danos do que álcool, te dá uma sensação gostosa, de escape, de desanuviação de pensamentos que te preocupam. Todos nós temos nossos escapes, certo? Comida, videogame, sexo, bebida, pornografia. O dela é maconha. Sabia que o canadibiol está sendo prescrito para melhorar a qualidade de vida de velhinhos com Alzheimer? Isso não é nada distante, sabia? Tá acontecendo no Brasil já faz um tempo, apesar de todo o estigma. Eles ficam super calmos, diminui a agressão contra cuidadores e companheiros.
Não é porta de entrada para outras drogas - eu por exemplo não tenho vontade ALGUMA de experimentar outras coisas. É mais seguro que álcool. Pesquise um pouco antes de demonizar este hábito dela, afinal, ela confiou em você para contar isso.

Ah! Eu também tomo dois remédios TARJA PRETA que na bula dizem "não sabemos exatamente o mecanismo de ação desta substância" e mesmo assim os médicos dão pra nós né. Já a maconha é mega estudada, por exemplo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> É um cu mesmo. Eu entendo totalmente sua ansiedade e sinto muito que esteja passando por isso. Para você ter ideia, eu estou tendo diarreia de ansiedade (oversharing, mas acho justo ser honesta o máximo possível para as pessoas entenderem, da forma mais clara possível, que não estão sozinha). Você diz que não existe resposta, mas existe sim!!! E quando eu descobri isso, fiquei muito mais liberta e calma.

Ansiedade é uma patologia. É genético, é do molde do cérebro de cada um, é da química. Ciência pura e racional. É das experiências também. E te prometo que muita gente está sentindo isso, apesar das redes sociais insistirem em dizer o contrário.

Eu liguei no CVV na segunda passada e perguntei para a moça se aumentou o número de ligações e ela disse que MUITO. Minha psicóloga disse que 100% dos pacientes dela só falam de pandemia e que todos pioraram. Toda a linha de tratamento dela mudou de alcançar meus objetivos (que no momento eram profissionais) para FICAR BEM.

Eu tenho depressão diagnosticada desde os 18 anos e fui a primeira da minha família a buscar esse diagnóstico. Depois meus pais seguiram e minha irmã também. TODOS nós temos. É como se fosse hemofilia, sabe? É doença, é inevitável. Eu tomo remédios e sempre fiz terapia (mas ressalto que você e o terapeuta precisam ser uma combinação! Não tenha nunca vergonha de trocar de terapeuta e experimentar outros tipos de linha de terapia. E não tenha vergonha se precisar de remédios! Eu amo meus remédios. Não quero depender deles a vida toda, mas eles são uma incrível muleta para eu buscar uma vida mais calma. Sem eles eu não teria força nem para ir para a terapia.

Por favor, sinta-se à vontade para me chamar no privado caso precise conversar. </TEXT>

Mas eu acho, honestamente, que a energia dessas pessoas segue no mundo, e manter a memória delas e falar com elas, independente se elas vão ouvir literalmente, de algum modo vão emanar bondade e saudade para o mundo e de alguma maneira vai chegar neles, mesmo que a gente ainda não compreenda esta maneira. Eu não sou muito "jovem mística", mas toda vez que converso com minha avó que já morreu, esposa dele, eu sinto meus pensamentos viajarem. De todo modo, você está certo - devemos aproveitar ao máximo as oportunidades de ficar com quem nos ama. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sinto muito que você tenha presenciado isso. Acho que as pessoas deveriam pensar no impacto que têm nas outras, mesmo nessas horas. Já pensei tantas vezes em suicídio, mas acho que não é por que a vida é difícil e eu não vejo razão para viver que as outras pessoas não possam ter suas razões, e não devem ser traumatizadas. Fico pensando numa criança vendo isso. Um amigo viu um cara se acidentar feio no metrô, sem querer, e ficou com isso pra vida. Imagina ver algo intencional. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Baby, quando que eu disse que eu quero sub sem regra? Eu fiz uma crítica a um modus operandi de subs grandes e, principalmente, **gringas.** E não foi nem por terem excluído meu post com base em regra, isso é plenamente compreensível, foi por terem nem lido o que eu tinha escrito porque acham que não vale o valiosíssimo tempo de "grande detentor das regras de um subreddit norte-americano" deles
Aliás, eu me senti à vontade pra postar aqui nessa sub, que você modera, justamente por que eu acho que este aqui é um espaço que não faria esse tipo de coisa. Senão nem me daria ao trabalho, concorda? Agora, se pegou no seu ego ou a carapuça serviu, aí é contigo... Enfim obrigada de todo modo por cuidar dessa sub. Eu sei o trabalho que dá. Mas a crítica aqui realmente era outra. </TEXT>

Sinto muito mas pra mim isso é coisa de quem não tem confiança nenhuma em si mesmo na vida real, não tem poder nenhum sequer, e precisa tanto de algum poderzinho que fica inventando essas coisas pra poder ter uma pessoa no universo para quem ele pode falar "não", mesmo que seja por texto e denunciado por um bot kk acho tosco pq tinha muito potencial para ser algo bacana e no fim vira um clube do bolinha </TEXT>
