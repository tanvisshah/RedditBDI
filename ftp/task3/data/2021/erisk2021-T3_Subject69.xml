<TEXT> My doctor didn’t give me a note, but told me to work from home if possible. My work allowed me to do so for my entire pregnancy starting in March through now. I did have to go into the office twice in August for a couple of things. But I only stayed those days for as long as I absolutely needed to (so 2 to 4 hours) and then completed the rest of my day at home. And I stayed away from other people while I was there. Everyone in my office was wearing a mask, as was I. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is possible. We know people who have been in somewhat similar situations. While I am due with our first baby any second now, my husband is his last year of fellowship. So I think other posters here have more relevant perspectives. One thing I thought I would mention, though, is that as soon as you know where you match, your husband should notify his program director of your due date (don’t bring it up in interviews). Some programs may be unofficially a little bit more flexible than others, but you have to ask what kind of flexibility is available. For instance, my husband’s current program has no official paternity leave policy, but they unofficially make it work outside of the hospital system’s HR framework by switching around research/elective coverage weeks. But you have to ask for it. The program does not assume everyone will want to paternity leave and does not proactively offer it. It is likely your husband will have some orientation scheduled on the day that you were due, even though his official work schedule won’t start until July 1. But we know a physician who was let out of orientation week due to a family emergency, so it is possible for your program to work with you in some cases.

Also, being open to being induced will help a lot in terms of planning. I know that’s a big decision and it feels crappy to plan it around your spouses work. But it does help. My due date is today, but baby shows no sign of budging. Right now, I am scheduled to be induced this weekend if the baby doesn’t turn up on our own. We picked the deadline based on my husband’s schedule. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unless Neil  Gaiman writes a sequel, probably never, unfortunately. The miniseries ended where the book did. He has sold the rights to his works to studios before such that studios could farm out sequels or an extended universe to other writers. But since he co-authored Good Omens with Terry Pratchett, who is now deceased, it feels less likely that he would do it with this work. That being said, I would love to see him write a sequel to this that could be adapted. But he may have reservations doing it without his friend and co-author. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone in a physician family who has vaguely looked up immigration requirements and talked it over with other healthcare workers, do not tell me what the issue is and is not. We won’t actually pull the trigger, because our families and friends are here. But no, it isn’t simply the virus numbers driving many healthcare workers to look abroad (edit: And when I say “many”, I am talking about people who have basically just googled it and considered it in passing. Not people who are seriously making the move. But most physicians and nurses we know have at least looked into it out of curiosity in the last few months).

If there was a pandemic, and the people around us actually gave a shit about it, it would be different. But it is very difficult to not to be pissed at the public that is around us right now. My husband has coworkers who have almost died from covid, literally. Meanwhile, my coworkers have no problem going to parties and make shitty comments to me when I pass on invitations. They insist on telling me why me continuing to wear a mask is unnecessary, and why it’s absolutely fine for them to hang out without a mask. My husband has a patient or two per week make various accusations about him being a puppet of some sort of big science propaganda conspiracy, even while he treats them while wearing sub-standard PPE. We have relatives  and so-called friends telling us that Covid is made up. The leaders of our country tell us and everyone else that this virus that has upended our lives it’s not a big deal. Meanwhile, we are saving every single precious surgical mask he manages to get from work. We treasure used N95 masks. We have contingency plans for me to move out with our newborn daughter in case shit hits the fan like it did in March and April again.

Last time, in March and April,I didn’t know whether I would see him alive again. That is not hyperbolic. But at least at that time, people were taking it seriously. We were pissed about the lack of PPE, but at least the public was on our side. But sometime around May or June, that changed, and all the sudden people around us were telling us how we were part of the problem. Europe’s numbers are climbing again as well, but our relatives there tell us that the anti-science rhetoric is fairly minimal where they are. It is very difficult to not envy the physicians practicing there. My husband signed up to be a doctor, not a martyr. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It’s not an issue of pandemic versus no pandemic. It’s not even merely an issue of “respects science“ versus “does not respect science.“ It’s an issue of working in an environment where the public cares that spreading the virus risks lives, including those of healthcare workers who are risking their lives during a worldwide shortage of PPE, versus an environment where people don’t care that they are spreading a pandemic that will threaten healthcare workers’ lives and their families’ lives. Doctors and nurses signed up to save lives. They didn’t sign up to risk their own and their loved ones for no reason than government incompetence and people’s extreme selfishness. They didn’t sign up to be forced to choose between living apart from their families for months at a time or risking their families lives just because selfish idiots refuse to wear masks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyone currently in PSLF with qualifying loans will most certainly be grandfathered in. It was not an issue between the Obama and Trump administrations, and there is zero reason to be concerned that it will be an issue during this potential change. It’s an issue of contract law. Current borrowers include attorneys who I’m sure would be more than happy to lead a class action suit should the government try to terminate the program for current borrowers for some idiotic reason. It would truly be mind boggling for the government to even try it, though. As the above poster said, thousands of people have made decisions in reliance on this program. And as far as “getting into” the program, have you submitted an employer certification form? That’s all you need to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am due tomorrow and have been pregnant the entire pandemic so far. There isn’t tons of data, but there is some. My OB now believes the riskiest times are first trimester, because of the danger of fever, and later third trimester, when women’s respiratory systems are already stressed from the pregnancy. That being said, she recommended sensible precautions during the whole pregnancy. Masks worn anywhere where you will be around the public— Even if it is outdoors and “socially distanced” (unless the gathering is small and *actually* socially distanced such that you can keep track of people and stay away from them. A lot of restaurants and outdoor events are not really safe enough in how they *actually* work). She said that if you have the ability to work from home, do it, so I have been home since March, even though most of the rest of my office is now back. During second trimester, I went out a few times early in the morning during the senior/vulnerable hours at a few stores. That was great, and I really miss it. That was also when numbers were relatively good in our area. But I stopped that when I hit third trimester, which was coincidentally when Covid numbers started going back up. I have been nowhere except my house, my parents house, and my doctors office in about two months. And my outings to grocery stores were in the single digits before that since I got pregnant.

We’ve infrequently had friends over in ones and twos to our back porch. We stay 10 to 12 feet away, no masks. And my parents have been very careful so that I can socialize with them during the week, because being by myself, pregnant, during a pandemic is sort of hell on the mental health. If your wife ends up staying home during the week, keep track of that. I am lucky that they were able to stay home and were willing to see me. But please be aware of this. If your wife stops working and has no social outlet while she’s pregnant, you will have to be that outlet, even if you come home mentally exhausted from work. Take a little break, but then spend time with her.

Additionally, some new data came out indicating that the rate of miscarriages may have gone up during the pandemic, not necessarily because of the virus itself, but because women were foregoing prenatal care they would usually get. If you feel like something is wrong and would otherwise go to the doctor or the ER if there were not a pandemic, go anyway. The hospitals are generally being pretty careful (my husband works at one). Finally, and this goes for everyone, but especially vulnerable people like pregnant women: just because you have some risk points doesn’t mean you should expose yourself to more risk: so just because, for example, you continue to work and expose your wife potentially, that does not mean you should just start dining indoors in restaurants because “well, I am already at risk.” Your risk increases with every opportunity you have to contracts the virus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is definitely some crazy Boomer versus millennial stuff. I got married a couple years ago, and I also picked out my ring since my husband was a little overwhelmed by it. I did not want a diamond for numerous reasons: 1) the price. While we could have swung it (with some credit), there are better things for us to spend our money on; 2) Again, the price, but with respect to the fact that I would be the one that would have to keep track of thousands of dollars worth of diamond on a tiny little thing for the rest of my life. WAY too much pressure. I know multiple people who have lost diamonds off of their rings, even when they didn’t lose the ring itself. 3) Ethical concerns. Most natural diamonds come from mines with awful working conditions. I looked into it A LOT, and even the “verified ethically sourced” diamonds cannot actually be verified as to where they came from (unless from Canada). Basically, they all get thrown together in foreign markets, so no one knows which diamond came from which mine. And the lab grown diamonds are almost as expensive these days, btw.

So in the end, we went with some more reasonably priced lab grown white sapphires. I went with those, by the way, because they are hard stones that will not chip or scratch very easily over the decades ($500 for 3 small stones on a 10k white gold band, which was selected for price and durability, too). I ruled out CZ due to durability concerns— it likely won’t last through the decades.

But listen to your girlfriend like she is the independent adult that she is. Her parents and your parents think that buying her a diamond will show her that you respect her. You can respect her by following her wishes, especially since she is the one who will be wearing that ring for decades to come.

However, if you want to offer the parents a “compromise“ just to get them off your back, have your girlfriend tell them that you offered her a choice, she’s stuck with the cheaper stone, but you then told her that you would be happy to upgrade it to a diamond in the future for maybe your 5th or 10th anniversary, if she wants a diamond by then. That’s a thing people do. Obviously, you do not actually have to follow through on this. But this may be a path of least resistance in terms of reducing headaches for the two of you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, that was after his initial tweet storm saying that he was going to end discussions. Unfortunately I did miss where he said that the senate needed to immediately pass small business recovery— it was hours after his initial tweets, and roughly at the same time I initially responded to you, and well, there is a lot to go through on his Twitter. But you got me there. But his initial threat, which was made independently of allowing for any stimulus bill unless after the election, still stands. This article lays out the timeline and his change of course, likely after he realized there was a huge backlash against him holding the country hostage. https://www.9and10news.com/2020/10/07/president-trump-tweets-about-shutting-down-coronavirus-relief-negotiations/ </TEXT>

<TEXT> But he didn’t just decline to pursue the Democrats plan. He ended all discussions over any stimulus bill, period, until he wins the election. The Democratic plan is not the only one that’s on the table right now. So not only is he refusing to do any work on what may be the single most important immediate issue for most Americans until after the election, his phrasing indicates that if he doesn’t win, he will allow no progress until January when a new president is installed. Either way, stalling discussions until even just November is reprehensible given the precariousness of peoples health and livelihoods right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love this arc even more now, because at the end of it all, both he and Abby accept they were wrong and accept the consequences— censure and her suspension of medical license. It took them time to each come to that conclusion, but they did. Both volunteered, in the end, to accept the consequences they received. At the end of it all, the viewer is left understanding that while they had good intentions, and while actual harm may not have happened, what they did was still wrong. Good people can still do bad things, but those bad things can be forgiven.

That being said, I think there’s a world of difference between that storyline and present day events. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This doctor is bound by HIPAA— he can only disclose what his patient allows him to, by law. He’s doing a pretty bad job of dodging questions— some of them so badly that it makes me think he is doing it on purpose and trying to convey as much information to the public as possible without going astray of the law (example from early on: he is not *currently* on oxygen, which tipped everyone off to the fact that the President had, at some point, likely been on oxygen. Then the press poked around until another source confirmed it). Additionally, if you read Tweet threads from other doctors interpreting the statements, he’s revealing even more there to people who understand the medical side (I’m not a medical professional, but the threads I’ve read are informative). Taking HIPAA into account, he comes off as someone stuck between a rock and a hard place, but doing the best he can within the confines of the law. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you are forgetting this is your husband’s baby too. Just because you didn’t need to talk it out with someone doesn’t mean that he deals with scary situations the same way. He needs emotional support for this scary time too. You have basically prioritized only your feelings and have cut him out of it entirely. I’m currently pregnant, and I can’t imagine demanding my husband not seek emotional support when necessary. And I hope you do not threaten to ban him from future ultrasounds over this. That’s just cruel, and as someone whose husband was unable to come to any appointments due to Covid, don’t undervalue how big a deal that experience is.

For instance, if Trump interrupted Biden during what was supposed to be Biden’s time and launched into a paragraph, but Biden then interrupted him, does that also count as an interruption for Biden, even though he was the one who was supposed to be talking according to the rules?

<TEXT> I have. My sister-in-law is a dentist who takes this virus seriously, and she gave me some good advice. She told me to take the first appointment of the morning, even if I had to wait a little bit to get that timeslot. The issue is that a lot of dental procedures aerosolize saliva, and aerosolized virus can hang around in the air for a little bit. So you want to go in first thing in the morning after anything in the air has had time to settle. She also said to ask what kind of face protection the dentist is using. You want them in either N95s, or in a regular mask plus a face shield. Additionally, she said to bring hand sanitizer with me and to use it whenever I feel the need. Coronavirus can survive on surfaces for a few days, and since you won’t be wearing a mask, you may be more likely to touch your face unconsciously and transfer germs from the chair. Also wash your hands with soap as soon as you leave the office. When I got home from the dentist, I immediately threw the clothes I wore into the washer.

I did all of that, and my dentist visit was fine. If your tooth has been hurting, don’t screw around with that. Call around to dentists until you find one following procedures you are comfortable with. My sister-in-law specifically said do not skip the dentist during pregnancy if something feels wrong. Pregnancy makes you prone to problems, and those problems can turn into long-term issues or even dangerous issues more easily during pregnancy. But, she also said that as long as you have a reasonably healthy dental history, it may be OK to skip a regular check up/cleaning until after your pregnancy. However, If you have a history where you are prone to problems (including cavities), don’t skip your check up/cleaning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From what I can tell from English-language sources on the subject, which are limited, I don’t think the vaccine was approved for males in Spain back then. In fact, I am not even sure that it is approved now, based on the paper below. If that is the case, it would have been irresponsible (if not illegal) for your doctor to give it to you. Given those guidelines at the time, it is unlikely that you would have found a doctor in the entire country willing to give it to you. But, if the guidelines have changed, or if you otherwise have access to it now, you can still get it and have it be effective! But unless Spain has some utterly bizarre medical licensing laws, you will not get the doctor’s license removed for following the medical guidelines at the time. You can ask in the European legal advice sub, but I expect they will tell you the same.

 Again, I could only get so far into this since my Spanish is not good enough to read medical papers. But I found no evidence whatsoever that Spain allowed the vaccine for males back then, and moreover did find *some* evidence that Spain did not approve of it.

You sound like you’ve been able to separate being mad at the situation vs being mad at the health care workers/taking it out on them. I’ve seen a lot of great people like that here, but I’ve seen an alarming number of people on this board and other groups directing their anger toward the wrong place and/or explicitly saying they planned to rip their masks off. IRL, I watched one person (and her partner who refused to leave the waiting room) take out the “no visitors during ultrasounds/appointments” policy out on my doctor’s receptionists, who have the unfortunate role of gatekeepers— straight up yelled at them for a few minutes to the point they had to threaten security :(

<TEXT> The PPE situation in this country is ridiculous. Your situation sounds utterly insane. We are lucky in that my husband rotated through a VA last month, and they were giving out N 95s like they were candy. They said he could have a new one for every single procedure(!), but he only took one per day, because he didn’t feel right taking more, given the overall situation in our city and elsewhere. But because of that month-long rotation, he built up a little stockpile of about 20 N95s that he only wore for one day. He sent some to his friend in Houston who is seeing Covid patients all day, every single day with a single N95 that he’s had for God knows how long. Even the used N95’s are better than what was going on down there. So at least now they are both able to rotate to a new one each day and sanitize/give them a rest in between. But it is ridiculous that that is considered a relatively good situation! </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, you’re not crazy. It definitely feels like I’m hallucinating a pandemic when I look at what other people are doing, sometimes. And it’s kind of infuriating. But also, don’t feel bad that you are taking some small and reasonable risk for the sake of your mental health. Your small, socially distance, cautious gathering with people you know to be taking reasonable precautions in their own lives seems like its benefits outweigh the risks to you. With this pandemic going on for months, and realistically another year or so, I don’t think it’s healthy for us to just never see anyone except our partners, and to never go anywhere, ever. I tried that, and my mental health took a very serious hit after a little bit. We’ve had a few gatherings like the one you described with just one or two people at a time— people we trust— and my mental health improved immensely. Your mental health matters too. It is just a matter of keeping the risk you take thoughtfully and carefully. Anyway, that’s where I’ve gotten to in my own life. I just wanted you to know that I don’t think you should feel bad about the way you saw friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don’t know about your hospital, but many hospitals in the US are still trying to conserve N95s. The stock at the hospital my husband is at this month is OK, but they are still at the point where they are only giving out one per week… and he wears it for about 9 to 10 hours every day. They are not meant to be used that much. And who knows how long that stockpile will last. So every single one they have to use unnecessarily dips into a stock they might need for a truly critical case in the future. Like, making staff unnecessarily wear an N 95 isn’t just uncomfortable for them, in some places, it really could be risking someone’s health in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it’s important to realize that it’s impractical to put the same restrictions on nurses, because that is their life day-in, day-out for months— realistically, the next 1-2 years. For patients, it’s an uncertain and inconvenient, but ultimately temporary, period of time. We can’t ask healthcare workers to not have close contact with their families for the whole pandemic. Ideally, the healthcare workers and their family members would be taking reasonable precautions outside of work (obviously, there are some that don’t, and they suck). But every restriction they can practically put in place lowers risk— an imperfect bubble is better than none. Although wanting you to stay there for 2 weeks is a lot to ask of someone— I’d be annoyed about that! Usually, I’ve heard partners being asked to stay put for the ~2-5 days the women are typically laboring/recovering in the hospital. That’s still inconvenient for many people, but it’s usually manageable with ahead notice, because it’s only 2-5 days out of that person’s life (versus the years nurses operate in the same environment). And importantly, it helps lower the overall risk in the ward, particularly in hot spots. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’ve heard so many people who have already delivered say that they forgot they were wearing one during labor. It’s helping me feel more confident and get over the mental block I have about it. I KNOW it’s going to be fine and want to wear them both for the healthcare team’s safety AND my own. I have no idea why it makes me so nervous, but I’m working on it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The tests have a pretty high false negative rate. It really just allows the hospital to know for sure who is definitely a risk to staff, and it allows them to be a little more lax with negative patients, because while there is still some risk, it’s much lower. For instance, I’ve heard many places will allow women to take the mask off for the final pushing stage... they probably would not allow that for someone who tested positive. Also, I’m not 100% certain, but in the US, insurance should be covering WAY more of your covid testing— most companies have committed to doing that. </TEXT>

<TITLE> THIS is why we’re being asked to wear masks during labor, restrict partners during ultrasound, etc. </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off, this is NOT meant to invalidate anyone’s feelings of sadness, disappointment, fear, etc. We are all entitled to feel what we feel in these unpredictable times. But [this article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/amp/Young-Houston-doctor-dies-after-fighting-for-her-15581069.php) is an example of why most of us are being asked to deliver with a mask on, and why most of us haven’t gotten to share an ultrasound appointment with our partners. The link is about how a young OBGYN physician just passed away from COVID. She caught it while helping fight the pandemic in the ER, but OBGYN patients like us can pass it to healthcare workers, too. [Over 900 healthcare workers in the US alone have died of covid](https://khn.org/news/exclusive-over-900-health-workers-have-died-of-covid-19-and-the-toll-is-rising/). I think most of us understand this on a conceptual level, but something about her being an OB and so young just jumped out at me as such a concrete example of why so much about perinatal care as changed during covid... why we have been asked to sacrifice experiences many of us spent years looking forward to.

I’m about a month out from my due date and am still afraid of wearing a mask to deliver (and mad that circumstances are such that it is necessary), and I’ve cried multiple times that my husband hasn’t seen an ultrasound of our baby. But my husband is in healthcare, too, and I’m glad that there’s a much higher chance he comes home safe to me, and that our baby and I stay safe, because his workplace is doing its best to protect him by telling his patients to wear masks and limiting visitors at appointments. Since I’ve seen confusion over the latter precaution in other posts— limiting visitors lowers transmission risk, even when they are from the same household as the patient, because the amount of virus in the air matters— the more in the air, the more the risk—> two people breathing it in the air is much riskier than just one. And this is *especially* important in small, enclosed rooms like medical exam rooms that healthcare workers spend 8-24+ hours in per day seeing dozens of people from all over the community. And for those of you that are pregnant AND in health care, thank you, and I can’t imagine the level of stress you’re feeling in all of this.

Again, I don’t want anyone to feel like I’m saying you shouldn’t feel upset about how all these precautions have affected you and your pregnancy— I feel upset, angry, and afraid too. I’ve cried about it more than a few times. This is more just to remind us all that these awful but necessary precautions are happening for a really, really good reason— we are protecting the people who put themselves at risk dozens of times per day, multiple times per week, for months on end, to make sure women and their babies get through pregnancy and labor safely. Take care, all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Very, most likey. The notary stuff belongs to the notary in every state I’ve heard of. While your company paid for and benefitted from them being a notary, as someone in that thread pointed out, that would be like your company trying to take back a university degree that it paid for when the employee leaves, except more serious because there are legal and ethical obligations being violated here. When a notary signs/stamps something, they are basically saying “I witnessed this document and can personally verify everyone’s identity and competency should this ever be in dispute.” No one but that individual can do that, even if the employer paid for it. If someone were to steal their seal and fraudulently notarize things, or tamper with the log, this could cause very serious legal, financial, etc. damage to those involved in the transactions. So that stuff MUST stay with the individual notary to protect the security of those documents— particularly since legal issues related to the notarization could come up well after the employee has left the employer they were with. Their responsibility does not end with their employment. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Quarantine finally has me losing it </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-09-03 23:53:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I am pregnant in my third trimester, working from home since March, and my husband just started a rotation at a hospital known have active Covid cases amongst the staff, and now he’s working longer hours. Because of his increased risk, I can no longer see my parents, who were my only outlet and contact during quarantine. And now he just gets home late, and when he is I get him for 45 minutes before he starts working on some bullshit presentation his program assigned. There’s always some presentation that he has to work on, because apparently 12+ years of using PowerPoint in higher ed/med school/residency/first 2 years of fellowship wasn’t enough to make sure that he knows how to give a presentation. But this one is driving me fucking crazy. It’s not his fault at all, but the isolation just has me at my wits end. And on top of that he starts home call tomorrow for a week. He’s been on every other week for over a month now. And I don’t know when I’m going to see another person other than my husband for five seconds. Maybe when I deliver at the hospital, I guess.

I am pregnant with my first and uncomfortable and increasingly anxious about the pregnancy because we are getting down to the wire, and I can’t even tell if the baby’s head is pointed down or if I’m looking at a c-section due to breech position. And I won’t know for a while, because until I hit 36 weeks (I’m 34 now), I only get to see the doctor in person once per month (it was once every 2 through 2nd trimester). I have trouble doing all the housework and cooking because my balance is off, and for some reason I am just clumsy as hell now. I don’t know if that’s because of pregnancy or what, but I’ve broken like three dishes in the last week.
 I just didn’t think I’d have to do the hardest part of pregnancy during a pandemic basically by myself. I thought I would at least have my mom while my husband was working so much. I’m just so over everything. I need this baby to bake for another six weeks, but the irrational part of me just wants to her now just so that I won’t be alone.

I don’t think any advice can help here, because the whole situation is what it is, and millions upon millions people are dealing with variations of it. I just finally reached a breaking point today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A hard no while I am pregnant, although I will deliver before it’s available, so it’s sort of irrelevant to me in that respect. I will wait to see what scientists and public health experts that are unaffiliated with the government have to say before getting it. From what I have read, the vaccine is likely to be as safe as any other vaccine on average, since it is based on past research, but the big question is whether it is effective, particularly in the long term. It’s hard for them to know how long immunity will last, how many doses will ultimately be needed, etc. So in the end, people who get the vaccine early may still need to act like they could catch it until longer terms studies are completed… Which *sort of* (but definitely not entirely) defeats the purpose of getting the vaccine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel you on the frustrating “well your mother is a doctor, so why can’t I do x” reasoning. My husband is a physician as well, and early on, my boss kept bringing that up as a way of questioning why I wanted to work from home to lower my risk of catching covid. Like, I can trust that my husband is wearing crazy amounts of hospital-grade PPE and decontaminating before interacting with me in any way. I can’t trust my co-workers to keep their less-effective cloth masks on when they go to the grocery store or parties or wherever they think it’s ok to go not social distanced during a pandemic. And yeah, he’s my biggest risk point, bigger than most people have (on paper at least), so why would I want to introduce MORE risk points into my life? Fortunately, they dropped that line of questioning, but it drove me crazy, particularly when my husband and I were debating whether we should even live together for the next few months. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It’s easy to feel crazy when so much of the world seems to be acting like there’s nothing going on. I definitely relate to that. You’re not crazy. But at the same time, *depending on the precautions she takes* when shopping, your mom isn’t necessarily crazy either (is she wearing a mask? Going to places where others are required to wear a mask? Going at times where she can stay 6 feet away from others?). Parents of young children have it rough right now. If she needs childcare, she needs childcare, and a lot of options parents used to have are now unsafe or nonexistent. She turned to you, perhaps because who it sounds like she can trust you to take this pandemic seriously.

However, that doesn’t mean you need to babysit for your sister. This doesn’t mean you need to go shopping all the time. Your risk tolerance is lower, because you are at a higher risk. Even if you were not higher risk, it is OK for your tolerance to be lower.

My mom and dad go shopping, but they wear masks and stay away from other people. They go at times when other people are less likely to be shopping. I still see them, because while my physical health and that of my baby is important, my mental health is important too. I saw no one but my husband for months before letting my parents into our bubble, and during that time my mental health really suffered. I needed the contact, and my parents are taking this seriously. And also, if I need something from a store, my mom can get it for me when she goes. So that’s another upside. I’m not saying you need to do the same thing. Everyone’s circumstances and risk tolerance is different. But since you asked how we deal, this is how I deal. I give myself this one outlet to help me get through this pandemic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When it comes to the party they went to, neither of you are being unreasonable— and I am VERY pro-mask, social distancing, etc. It sounds like they took reasonable precautions, but it also sounds like your risk tolerance is much lower than theirs, which is also reasonable, given the situation. The issue is that everyone in a household has to be on the same page about these things, and there was a big miscommunication. On the face of things, your parents did not make any ridiculous assumptions, as what they did sounds in line with public/expert health recommendations. However, it was not what you thought you were agreeing to, which is also fair. The important thing is that you all need to get on the same page going forward.

It sounds like from your description that you may keep bringing up the party and rehashing it, but that ship has sailed. There is nothing they can do about it now, and it doesn’t seem productive to keep bringing it up. But it also sounds like they are not engaging in conversations on how to manage future social activities— I can’t tell if that’s because you are bringing that up in the context of the party they went to, which is a past event they can’t undo, or if they just refuse to engage. But the important thing is to bring up future expectations without rehashing past events.

Give it another day or two, and then say, “I don’t want to talk about the party you went to. I know we just miscommunicated and had different assumptions about how to handle those situations. But it sounds like we need to talk through our expectations and plans going forward so we can all be on the same page as to how our household manages this pandemic.”

Then, before giving your opinion, ask them what level of social exposure they fee is reasonable— based your description of what they did at the party, I’m thinking their answer will be something like “seeing people socially distanced and outdoors.” Before you respond, remember that opinion is in line with public health recommendations, and is not unreasonable; it’s just not what you are comfortable with (which is fair). But try not to respond in anger or like they are being crazy or irresponsible. Try not to bring up the party. If they do, just say, “none of us can undo the past; let’s just focus on getting through this together and talk about the future.”

Then, when they are done, tell them what you would be comfortable with. “Given that we’ve lost two pregnancies already, we are especially afraid of catching this disease, and my doctor says that I fall into a high-risk category for it. Would it be possible for you to...” and then say what you WOULD be comfortable with them doing, not what you wouldn’t. Think about this ahead of time: would you be ok with them doing smaller social distanced things— like 6—8 ft apart outdoors with only 2-4 other people where everyone brings their own food/drink? Maybe something like that but with masks and no food? Or are you just only ok with them seeing that one couple from work? All of those options are valid opinions for you to propose, but be prepared for them to disagree, particularly if what you are comfortable with is no or almost no social interaction going forward.

Ultimately, your health is what matters, and everyone has their own risk tolerance levels, which is ok (I’m NOT including the dumb anti-mask crowd here). If you all can’t come to an agreement, or if they refuse to discuss this civilly, it is probably time to look at alternate living arrangements. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She made sure the flight she booked had very low capacity. If it had filled up after she booked, she would’ve just kept moving the flight, which she was able to do on her airline for no charge. Hers ended up being somewhere between 5 and 10% full. A lot of the US to UK flights are like that since travel restrictions have made the number of passengers plummet. She was at least 10 to 15 feet away from the next nearest person. She also wore both a mask and a face shield the entire time (mask protects other people, shield helps protect you). She would quickly pull down her mask and use a straw to drink under the face shield. She only ate what she absolutely had to to get through the flight, and only what she could pop into her mouth quickly/easily under the face shield. She also brought her own snacks that would be good for that. She also brought wipes and hand sanitizer on board with her. She restricted liquids before and during the flight, and made sure that she did not use the plane bathroom until it had been empty for a little bit. But a lot of planes, particularly the large international ones, at least on United, have good air filters. Oh, and she also carried on so she would spend less time in the airport. It was a pretty big effort on her part.

She said that everyone on the flight wore a face mask the entire time except for meals, and people were pretty quick about those. But those people were pretty far away from her, and she just waited for about an hour after people finished eating to have a bite to eat.

One thing for your family member to check on is travel restrictions. My sister was only able to come over to the US is because she is a US citizen. And she had to quarantine for 14 days by law when she went back to the UK, which was OK since she’s been working from home. </TEXT>

We’ve had posts here, and I’ve dealt with an incident or two personally, of medical spouses under-reacting to their families’ medical issues— treating the issue clinically, and not as a personal issue that is an emotional situation. That is what they are trained to do with patients, so they get tripped up sometimes in their personal lives when faced with similar situations.

But what you are talking about is not that. Your partner is not only not emotionally supporting you, he’s not even physically or logistically supporting you. Frankly, it kind of sounds like he’s risking your health, although I’m not sure we have quite enough information to make that call. But ask yourself if that is true. Are you up and around more than you should be because he simply won’t help you when he otherwise could? Because he’s choosing to be out of the house rather than with you?

“Stressed during residency” is not an excuse for this behavior, so don’t let him try to use it as one. To put your partner’s behavior in perspective: my husband is a fellow, and when I had severe hyperemesis during my first trimester of pregnancy (I *literally* couldn’t walk to the bathroom without throwing up), for 5-6 weeks, he had to do literally all of the housework and all of the cooking, in addition to taking care of me, all while working crazy hours during the absolute height of the pandemic. At one point, he had to help me dry off after a shower, help me go upstairs/physically get in bed, etc. because I was too exhausted. That’s how dependent on him I was. Granted, I was alone a lot and door dash/Instacart got him through a lot of days, but he left me food, water, medication, etc. in places that were easy for me to get to, and he kept in contact during the day (or made sure my mom did if he was too busy to check texts or call). He used his training to closely monitor my health every morning and every night to make sure we weren’t at “go to the ER” territory (frankly, if he weren’t a doctor and if we weren’t in a pandemic hotspot, we would have been *well* past the point of going to the hospital). He didn’t accuse me of being needy, even though I know he was stressed as hell with it all— after I got better, we had to focus on his mental health a bit. It was an awful period for both of us. As sick as I was, I think it may have been worse for him. The point is that a supportive partner doesn’t abandon you during a health crisis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would not get on a flight, especially a domestic one. Some domestic flights are being packed and cleaning/enforcement of masks is iffy sometimes. Also, if you are flying from a small airport, you will be on a small plane with worse air circulation and social distancing, most likely.

My sister just flew from the UK, and did TONS of research on flying before doing it. The UK has almost no cases in her area and has more stringent measures in place for flights leaving from there (she also got rapid testing before leaving there). She said the only reason the US airport she flew into was safe for her was because she flew into the international terminal, which was practically empty. She went by the domestic terminal, and she said it looked a shit show. She then elected to drive several hours from that major airport rather than taking a connecting flight to our smaller nearby airport like she usually would, because her research showed that US domestic flights were MUCH less safe than international ones leaving from the UK. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are in the US, definitely put intern. I review entry-level resumes, and I would find it a little strange if someone put “trainee.” It wouldn’t be so strange that I would toss the resume or anything, but “intern” is definitely much more common, and sounds like it’s more advanced than a trainee. To me, “trainee“ sounds like it may be that you started a job but got fired before you finished the training period. I would definitely be asking you more questions about how long you were there, what you did, etc. in an interview to figure out what happened there. However, if you are not in the US, I cannot speak to resume norms elsewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The amount of ableism in this comment is staggering, considering you claim to have a disability. Not believing someone has a disability simply because you don’t have it/haven’t heard about it/can’t see it? FFS. That is practically a textbook definition. You are not an expert, even if you have some run-of-the-mill bad allergies. Some people’s allergies, even with the best medical care, can’t just be made to disappear— that is why people still die of anaphylaxis. Congratulations; you got lucky and were able to “take care” of your allergies. Some people are very unlucky and due to the severity of their allergy (or other co-occurring conditions) are unable to, and are considered to have a disability— in addition to knowing someone with incurable dog allergies as bad as OP’s (she’s tried EVERYTHING and no progress), I know a friend of a friend who received disability benefits from the government (the AMERICAN government, which is stingy AF with that) due to an an *extreme* allergy to lavender— as in multiple ER visits per year because she can’t even stand next to someone who put on hand cream with lavender in it 30 minutes before without going into anaphylaxis. THAT is how bad allergies can be. It got so bad she was unable to work with any other people, go to any stores, etc. She had to completely change industries to something She could do 100% from home. Allergy shots would kill her, and pills did absolutely nothing. What do you suggest she do “to take care of it” that her medical team hasn’t already tried? </TEXT>

<TEXT> You need to read the original post. Her allergies ARE that bad, likely to the point where they legally qualify as a disability as well. I’m guessing you don’t have much experience with severe environmental allergies. Some people have such bad allergies/co-occurring conditions that they can’t just take shots or pop a few pills and be fine. I have a friend with a similar allergy to dogs (so similar that I would have thought she was OP if she had just gotten married). Allergies like these— the ones that require the heavy duty sleepy allergy pills— are SERIOUS and life threatening. My friend’s dog allergy has put her in the ER more than once. She’s 31 years old, and the allergy can’t just “be taken care of” or else she would have done it, since it seriously affects with her life pretty much every day she leaves her house. She has pursued shots, but she is not a good candidate for them, and the pills make her practically non-functional (she is also not allowed to drive or even do her job after taking them). In this post the friend brought the dog to the wedding, OP had the option of risking her life or sleeping through/not remembering her own wedding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A big caveat to this: know your company! Keep your ear to the ground when it comes to “office gossip.” Office gossip is your BEST FRIEND as long as you are not seen to be “fanning the flames” of dramatic situations. Listen in the break room and file away information on your HR managers, upper management etc.— how do they handle situations? Are they smart enough to see a potential PR/legal landmine when they have one (The HRs who don’t recognize illegal activity or the potential for bad publicity (even if only within their own industry) are the ones to be especially careful of, because they *most* obviously have no critical thinking skills). Or do they simply tend to actually be helpful/do the right thing? How do they handle senior/upper management vs. low-level/new people? Do they seem a bit dense/hardline when it comes to employees vs. the company, showing little empathy or flexibility? Do they tend to favor upper management no matter what? Do they half-ass legal/ethical requirements, or do they inform and enforce with full effort?

There are some HR departments that take care of their employees, but sadly they seem to be far and few between. My previous jobs have had HRs similar to what OP describes, but over time, I’ve learned my current one is fabulous. If you have a good one, it would be unfortunate to feel that you couldn’t use it. My company’s HR department has decades of goodwill built up with its employees— especially the lower level ones. I feel like I could trust them if a difficult situation came up, because I’ve heard about them handle previous problems fairly. They work their asses off to not fire people, to the point that they have provided entirely new job training so that people could move departments rather than be jobless when their position got cut (a legal secretary got training to become an accounting clerk; another got months of training to learn to field IT Help Desk calls). They never hesitate to support lower level employees against upper level if the situation calls for it, and they make very, very sure that we all know our legal rights, procedures for making complaints, etc. People rarely have to make major complaints because HR is proactive in creating a good office culture. I’ve never had to make a complaint, but I know a few people who have made minor ones, and they were happy (or at least just fine) with how it turned out. </TEXT>

We are limiting visitors to our parents. We are lucky in that they’re all driving distance and are able to reasonably quarantine for two weeks ahead of our due date. We are also lucky in that we can trust them to actually do it.

But we are also requiring a DTaP and a flu shot of anyone meeting the baby in the first year. It’s not much to ask, especially since people should have those anyway. The baby will not meet our siblings or anyone else for a couple of months at least, because our siblings will not be able to quarantine at all and are living/working in relatively higher risk situations. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyone in the US can get one in normal years (when there is no shortage, which is rare but expected this year due to people’s fears about COVID). In a lot of circles, including mine, it is often just taken is granted that people will get the flu shot, especially if they are expecting to meet a newborn. That being said, some people have to be talked into it.

The flu shot isn’t 100% protection against contracting it or spreading it around, but it does help. Most people still restrict visitors for the first one to three months to family, close friends, etc. just in case. They don’t completely shut the house down like now, but they limit to people they trust to have gotten the shot and to own up to not feeling well, even if it’s just the sniffles.

The flu truly can be deadly to infants, particularly during the fourth trimester when the immune system is still so fragile. In the US, many hospitals even restrict the number of visitors to delivery wards during flu season for that reason. In a normal non-covid winter flu season at my hospital, we would be restricted to four total visitors beyond my husband and I.

Edited to reflect that after the ACA, the flu shot no longer costs money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, that complete lack of empathy, not only for other people, but for what YOU are going through, would be a dealbreaker for me. I honestly can’t believe you still have the capacity to talk to her at all. I would not. Reading what you described, the only response I can think of that I’d consider is along the lines of “fuck off” (or just ghosting). But I’m guessing that’s not the advice you’re looking for. But I would seriously consider whether you want this person in your life at all.

If you do really want to keep this person in your life, tell her, “I know you don’t believe in the severity of this pandemic, but I do, and it is greatly affecting my life. It is extremely distressing to me when you talk about it. I’m happy to talk to you about other things, but not that. If you cannot respect this boundary, then I may need to scale back communication with you.” </TEXT>

<TEXT> That model was based on a full-time working person relying on the unpaid labor of a stay at home spouse. The working person would leave for the day, maybe go to the gym after work, and come home to a clean house and a meal. Very little housework was required of them, because that was their stay at home spouses full-time job. Now, everyone either lives alone or lives in a household where both people in the couple work at least full-time. Fitting in all the “extra” is impossible. You cannot work full-time+, exercise the amount you’re supposed to, cook homemade nutritious meals, sleep a full amount, and completely maintain a clean and fully repaired home, on top of having the “me time” and social time everyone says you’re supposed to have. And all of that is without considering households with children, who come with significant extra time requirements.

If someone makes you think that they are doing it all with a full-time job, they either are lying (either to you or to themselves), or their mental health is likely suffering under the pressure of not letting anything go.

The days of everyone having a perfectly cleaned leave-it-to-beaver home are gone, unless they are able to outsource it. “Good enough“ or “decent“ is the name of the game when it comes to housework. And most people are not cooking homemade nutritious dinners every night. They rely on meal prepping, leftovers, takeout, frozen meals, etc. That’s not to say people never, ever cook full meals. But they are not usually doing it every night (or even most nights), unless that is their way of relaxing. But at the end of the day, in the US, and in other countries that operate like it, people just don’t have enough time with a number of hours they are expected to work, or HAVE to work to survive. </TEXT>

It meets online once per week and is run by a therapist who specializes in perinatal anxiety and depression. A lot of it has become a Covid anxiety support group, given the times we live in. While further interventions are available if I want them, or if the therapist feels like I should pursue them, the support group has been hugely helpful.

<TEXT> I am not in med school or in medicine, but my husband is, and we know a lot of people in the field. I worry about the mental health of my husband and our friends pretty regularly, and all of them generally are passionate about their jobs. Medicine has one of the highest rates of suicide. That sounds dramatic, but it’s true. My husband knows more than one colleague who has killed themselves, and I think that’s true for a lot of physicians— and he is early in his career. This country literally loses a med school’s worth of physicians to suicide every year (and that was before Covid). The hours are long and constant, you’re usually sleep-deprived, and the stuff you deal with it is high stakes, stressful, and sometimes heartbreaking. I don’t experience it firsthand, but I have a front row seat and do my best to make sure my husband is managing the stress well— sometimes he doesn’t. And all this is for people who, at the end of the day, love their work because they are passionate about it. I can’t imagine how people who are only in it for their parents, for the money, etc. cope. I definitely couldn’t. This field has very, very real and sometimes devastating effects on mental health even for people who want to be in that profession. I don’t think I’m being overly dramatic when I say that you would be risking more than just your basic level of happiness if you went into it not really wanting to be there. </TEXT>

Who knows how advanced technology will get, or what new tool will pop up to comb through peoples post histories. The issue of Internet privacy is so important that it is best to err on the side of extreme caution, in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So there are 3 follow-up series after the movie: SG-1, and then Atlantis and Universe, which are spin-offs. All are complete and wont’t be coming back. What people on this sub are talking about is wanting to see a reboot or a new spin-off. SG-1 as a series is complete as a series and had 10 seasons. Atlantis had 5 seasons and ends in an ok place, but it could have used another seasons to flesh out where it left things. It ends reasonably well, though, and it’s a great show. Universe ends on a cliffhanger, since it got cancelled mi-plot arc. It was very different from the other two series— darker in tone. In my opinion, it is good when assessed on it’s own merits and not in comparison to the rest of the franchise, since it’s so different. You also get to see characters from the other two shows to guest spots. You can find all of these on Hulu. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, this is hard. How badly does your son want to come home? Does he need to be home for school? If not, unfortunately, it sounds like the best place for him may be staying with his dad for a few months. That kind of separation just sounds really hard, but it sounds like it’s the one that keeps everyone healthy both physically and (relatively speaking) mentally. Because quarantining a 12-year-old alone in his room for two weeks just doesn’t sound like it would be good for him. But you know your kid best. And while it sounds like your mother means well and desperately wants to help, a one-week quarantine doesn’t seem long enough to keep her safe in her immune compromised condition. So I’m not sure I would take her up on her offer. This just sounds rough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the big one is not being able to have family members at the hospital, and having to deliver with a mask (which I’m willing to do if necessary, but it sounds scary). I think another issue is the amount of time between in person appointments where I could hear the heartbeat. During mid second trimester, after my nausea was gone, but before I could feel the baby, I had no in person appointments and didn’t get to hear the heartbeat for about two months. It was torture. I just had to assume the baby was still alive with a beating heart, and I had no confirmation that I was still pregnant. At least when I was nauseous, I knew the morning sickness was a sign that I was still pregnant. I had hyperemesis, which was awful, and I cried after I realized it had gone away but I still couldn’t feel the baby. Because as awful as the nausea was, at least  it meant I was still pregnant.

In the amount of time between visits in general is just disconcerting. It’s hard to know, especially as a first time mother, whether I am getting adequate obstetrical care. Even in the third trimester, every other appointment is telemedicine up until 36 weeks.

And then, of course, the isolation has been hard. And missing out on all the things I was told to expect and enjoy about pregnancy. Sharing it with people, a baby shower, even just getting to shop for baby things in maternity clothing has been difficult. All I want is just to be able to try on a maternity bra in person. And we didn’t get to tell almost anyone that we were pregnant in person, which sucked. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been pregnant for the duration of the pandemic, and the only public place I feel safe going is Trader Joe’s. I have attempted a couple other grocery stores, and stores in general, and none of them have gone to the efforts that Trader Joe’s and it’s staff at my local store have gone to to keep the store safe. They even open an hour early for Covid vulnerable people, whereas other stores just have “special hour” during their first official store hours! That means really that only the customers that have gone to look for TJ’s special hours are the ones there, and those people are the most invested in staying safe. Everyone is in masks, and it’s rare for someone to break the 6 foot rule, which is even harder in TJ’s smaller floor space than in other stores. People will stand and wait until there is room for them to pick up the item they want. That never happens anywhere else! Part of it is the customer base at that time, but I think a big part of it is the tone that the staff sets for everyone.

The staff is so respectful of everyone’s safety. All staff always has their mask on correctly, even though I know they have to wear it all day, which can’t be easy. To put this in perspective, one time, I went shopping at a baby store for a stroller and all the employees had their masks on their chins or under their nose. In a store full of pregnant women. So TJ’s employees dedication to proper mask wearing is especially impressive to me. During that early hour, I shop while the staff is still stocking shelves, and instead of being annoyed that customers are interfering with their usual workflow, they are so kind and willing to help (from a distance!). It’s the only store I’ve seen that has someone outside not only monitoring the cleanliness of the carts, and making sure the covid vulnerable people are all set.

Anyway, my husband and I have decided that Trader Joe’s is the only public place I will go the rest of my pregnancy. Eventually as I get close to my due date, I will have to stop even that per my OB’s advice. But being able to get out of my house to go somewhere that feels safe has been saving my sanity. Before I decided to venture out of the house, I was feeling so isolated and nervous about going. So thank you Trader Joe’s! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many US States (or at least mine and several others I know of) have similar laws for infants. My state even has “baby boxes” at a few fire stations around the state so that mothers can legally and anonymously give up their babies if they feel they need to do it that way, the thought being that some babies may end up staying in dangerous situations if the mothers fear people knowing who they are upon surrender. The boxes are temperature controlled, lock after being closed, and send an alert to someone to come get the baby so it is not alone for too long. They are not used frequently and are relatively new, but they have been successfully used several times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Keep your head down as far as drama/gossip, but DO make chit chat. But your chit chat should be relatively innocuous— what you did over the weekend (family friendly version), the weather, ask after your co-workers’ families, etc. People who are considered likable are more likely to be promoted over people who are considered boring, even if they are not unlikable. But bosses tend not to like the employees who always seem to be involved in drama. Also, almost conversely, if you can *listen in* on short bursts of gossip without participating, that could be to your advantage in terms of knowing what is going on in the office. It’s a balancing act.

If people start making gossip or trying to pull you into a dramatic conversation, just stay quiet, maybe nod and smile, and say “sorry, I have to run to the restroom” or something. Don’t be the stick in the mud who comes off as judging people for gossip.

Finally, try to fix or at least come up with an idea for a solution to a problem before bringing it to your boss. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The implication that women are have showers for “free stuff” is pretty judgmental. Having an in-person shower is not worth the risk to me, either, but there are better, less judgmental ways to phrase what you said.

Edit bc accidentally sent at paragraph break: For a lot of people, the shower is a cultural rite of passage that marks a huge milestone in life. Entire anthropological texts have been written about the place giftgiving has in cultures throughout the world. It is practically an entire sub discipline in Anthropology. In giftgiving cultures, the act of giving and receiving a gift is about more than what the gift is. It is about the thought, love, and/or respect behind it. This goes hand-in-hand with why giftgiving is considered one of the five love languages. These types of events are also where communities come together. It’s a way to see and share an experience with loved ones. And it is not selfish to want to be celebrated in a way that we all have celebrated our friends and family before this pandemic, and will celebrate afterwards.

While mitigating the risk of spreading coronavirus takes precedence, the desire itself is not selfish. We all got screwed in this pandemic out of a lot of experiences any pregnant person pregnant at any point BUT during the pandemic gets. So be nice to each other. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pragmatically speaking, my thought is that there’s probably not much she can do now as a resident, because hospitals pretty much have total leverage over their trainees due to how much the trainees have at stake. Like, it’s really hard just to go find another job as a resident. But feel free to burn it to the ground when she’s done there. Flame it on social media, warn other women thinking of having kids to avoid it, etc. One of my husbands friends from med school literally just did that yesterday. She wrote an entire post that’s going a little viral on how terribly her residency program treated her when she was pregnant. But she didn’t write it until she was an attending at another institution. It sucks that things are that way. Your wife’s program should be ashamed of themselves.

To put this in perspective of how wrong your wife’s program is, my husband’s (currently in training as a fellow) program director has gone out of his way to keep *my husband* away from Covid patients just because *I* am pregnant. We did not ask him to do that, he just did it. Our hospital system as a whole keeps pregnant employees away from Covid patients by default and puts them behind desks/on telemedicine whenever possible, just to be careful (unless they request otherwise). This extends to trainees, as far as I am aware. My husband’s pregnant co-fellow has also been kept away from Covid patients. Back in March and April, when they were pulling the fellows in to treat patients in Covid wards, and she was told there was no scenario, no matter bad how things got, where she would be put on a Covid ward. My husband was not made the same promise, but that seems more reasonable since he’s not the pregnant one. But we are so thankful that my husband was never pulled for that. They really went out of their way to keep him toward the bottom of the list of people getting pulled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And be professional and courteous, and moreover, respectful, to every single person you meet from the second you enter the property. My company always asks the opinion of the receptionist. Most people know that trick though. The tip/basic common courtesy that a shocking number of people don’t follow is being respectful to younger-looking and junior employees. Never, ever dismiss or be disrespectful to an employee who seems like they might be an intern or entry-level. For one thing, they may be older and more experienced than you think (at my last job, one guy lost an offer for assuming I was an hourly employee instead of the manager he was going to interview him, and asking me, as he filled out the application, if the job was easy enough to “phone it in” during shifts. I mean, it was, but I didn’t want anyone dumb enough to bring that up like that.).

For another thing, the company may put a lot of stock in what the junior employees think of an interviewee. At my sisters old company, a cocky 22-year-old college student lost a job offer he was otherwise 100% set to get, because the higher ups checked with the first and second year employees and discovered that he was completely disrespectful to them during the tour and Q&A they did with him. </TEXT>

Plenty of perfectly healthy people are getting severe cases, even if they aren’t hospitalized.

Also, take it from someone who got pertussis (whooping cough) as a perfectly healthy— actually, extremely healthy— teenager back before they realized people need a booster shot to prevent it. I was an athlete, I ate healthy, had all my vaccines, had no additional conditions, etc. I STILL was *severely* sick for about 6 months. It took me years to get my full respiratory health back.

<TEXT> It will result in them being treated as positive, which is presumably what they are afraid of— meaning they will most likely end up in the wing with positive patients. The husband may be presumed positive and barred from the hospital. The hospital may recommend newborn separation, although that is not mandatory. And moreover, doctors and nurses will not come check on your friend nearly as much, because they will have to take on and off full PPE (which is especially hard if the hospital still had to reuse).

Frankly, your friend will very likely get the bare minimum necessary care with a begrudging (but still professional) attitude from staff and no more— simply because she will be perceived as putting staff at unnecessary risk and anxiety when she could just take the test. She will be compromising her own comfort— she can expect that extra pillow or jello cup to not show up until the next time it is absolutely necessary for someone to enter her room to perform a medical service, because why should they superfluously put their own health at risk for someone who couldn’t care less about putting them (or at least making them feel) at risk in the first place? Your friends can sue if they want, but they will lose (and still have to pay their attorney, assuming they can even find one to take the case), because the hospital has every legal right to do what is necessary to protect its staff, and it’s not illegal for healthcare workers to be unfriendly. So if your friend wants the best care for herself and her baby, she should take the test. </TEXT>

Out of my group of six friends where I am the last to get pregnant, three of them tried for 2+ years to get a healthy pregnancy that went to term (as in they were TTC for 2 years; not that they were TTC for 1 year and then pregnant the next. It took them all almost 3 years or more to end up with a full-term baby). One had unexplained infertility, one had multiple miscarriages, and the last had one miscarriage + more months of infertility than usual afterwards. I have a family history of difficulty conceiving, and while it didn’t turn out that I had that issue, it was a significant concern for us when we decided on when to start trying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on your personal situation. Personally, even had I known this would happen, I wouldn’t have waited. But, both my husband and I are in stable jobs and didn’t lose any income, and my job has been very accommodating so far in letting me work from home. And most of all, with my age, and my mothers history having problems conceiving, it would have been really risky for us to wait.

My husband is in healthcare, which added some additional stress, but we’ve hit a rhythm with that and have realized that with proper PPE, which he’s been lucky enough to have access to, he is perfectly safe at work. and since he works in healthcare, his workplace takes pandemic precautions incredibly seriously (he is also in a hospital where every patient gets a covid test upon admission, which takes A LOT of stress out of it). Our baby is due in October and was supposed to go to daycare next January, but it’s looking like it may be too risky to send a newborn to daycare. I’m not 100% sure what we are going to do, but we are lucky enough that our mothers have said that they would step in for a few months if necessary to help us deal with that. So our situation is much more low risk than others. Like, if I were younger and a teacher that was going to have to be teaching this fall, I would 100% wait. I know that we have been very lucky for our situation to shake out the way that it has.

Maternity care has definitely been different, but manageable. I was super scared a couple months ago when all this started, but things have calm down on that front, too. The healthcare system now knows a little bit more about what it’s doing when it comes to managing maternity care during this. At least in my area. Even if numbers increase (they will), as long as my husband is not symptomatic when I go into labor, he will be allowed to be there with me. And even if he is symptomatic and can’t come, I will be allowed to choose another support person. And they are no longer separating newborns from Covid positive mothers at most places now, which is immensely reassuring. I am in a Facebook group for pregnant women in my area, and the ones that have already delivered  have all had positive experiences delivering at the hospitals nearby, including mine.

I will say that I was initially *incredibly* stressed about this entire situation for a few months, and almost lost my mind, but I am not feeling *as* anxious about it now. I won’t say that this is causing zero stress even now, but I’m doing okay with it. I think not being pregnant during a pandemic would be preferable, but I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve accepted it is what it is. </TEXT>

I know a point came pretty early in my relationship with my now-husband where we both had to commit in different ways, probably more consciously and possibly earlier than couples without someone in such an intense field. I had to commit to working around his schedule almost exclusively. I had to be the one to move stuff around to make time with him work, because 95% of his stuff wasn’t movable. I also had to commit to mostly being at his place to maximize our time together; I had to commit to getting woken up hours earlier than I otherwise would have if I wanted to spend the night with him more. He had to commit to risking changing up his tried-and-true routines that kept him sane. He had to commit to remembering to that include another person in communicating his schedule. Do those trade-offs sound uneven? They are; they most definitely are. But it’s worth it, and not nearly so bad as it sounds once you find a rhythm.

One thing you might ask is if you can spend more evenings together. Could she take an hour for a late dinner right after work if you have it ready, or could you take a run for take-out together? Can you make dinner for her and then read next to her while she studies sometimes? Another part of going next-level, I found, was just allowing being in the same room together to count as quality time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This was a big struggle for me when we first got engaged and he was still in residency. It still comes up from time to time, and has been an issue during Covid when I am home alone all day while he’s gone. Pre-Covid, I would make sure to try to schedule outings or meeting up with friends when he worked weekends. Now, since that’s not advisable, I just go see my mom, who we share a bubble with. Weirdly, finding television shows that were just for me to watch helped. Shows where I don’t have to wait for him to be home and can just fill my time with them. But we have also found short 30 minute comedies that we can watch together, because sometimes that’s all he has the time and energy for at night, especially when he’s taking home call. And sometimes, just being in the same room together is enough to count as togetherness. He likes to play computer games to get his head out of work, and sometimes I’ll just sit and watch while he streams it onto the TV so we can see. Or I will sit next to him and read while he plays. We have also played through a bunch of video games together. I don’t like to play, but I do like to watch, so I get input on which games he plays. It’s a nice compromise that lets both of us do something we enjoy while still spending time together. Finally, we go for walks together when he’s not on call. Even if it’s just a quick 15 minute walk around the block.

The other big thing is that he does not get a pass when it comes to communicating with me about his schedule. That was a major issue for us at first. He was just not used to putting his life into a calendar, much less sharing it. Now, his schedule goes in our shared calendar so that I can at least sort of predict when he will be home or not. His call weeks and working weekends do not take me by surprise. That way, I can schedule my life and our life, since I tend to schedule most things for the two of us. Also, if he’s going to be extra late, he can find five seconds to send me a text. “I was too busy” doesn’t cut it when it takes such little time to send a text. Even if it’s just a text that says, “waiting to do a procedure. Don’t know when I will be home.” </TEXT>

All domestic abuse is awful, but I’ve always found any type that’s premeditated/thought out (rather than “fly off the handle” anger) to be especially horrible. He did this to you as on purpose as a person could be while in 100% control of his actions. Leave him and never, ever talk to him again. Zero contact, because he WILL try to manipulate you into getting back with him. </TEXT>

Tbh, I’m not sure I would ever be comfortable visiting your in-laws, even if you didn’t stay with them. They already tried to keep the children away from you once by essentially attempting to kidnap them. If they want to see the kids (when or IF you are ever ready), they should come to you, on your turf, where you have other family to back you up. And they can stay in a hotel, and do not ever get the kids alone. I also don’t think I would allow zoom calls if you are not in the room. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My husband and I are due with our first baby in October, and it’s a girl. We both love the name Sylvie and plan to call her that. But a part of me would like to make her full name Sylvia so that she has a more “serious” sounding name to use if she would like to when she’s older. I feel like in the US, Sylvie still sounds too much like a young/familiar nickname or even made-up, and it hasn’t quite crossed over to sounding as “serious” or “real” as nicknames like Vicki or even Ellie. We would basically never use Sylvia except on official documents. My husband wants to just go with Sylvie since we would never really use Sylvia, but he understands my concern and is willing to go with it. But now I’m wondering if I’m overthinking it. </TEXT>

When I was first able to venture out with a mask in May, it felt so hard to breath. But now that I’ve been able to build my endurance back up, wearing masks has gotten much easier.

<TEXT> I come from a wealthier family than my husband’s, and he’s never acted like that or expected my parents to pay for anything, even with his (which is now our) boatloads of student loans that put our personal net worth in the negatives. The way your fiancé is acting is not normal or okay.

It’s easier said than done, but you do not have to be stuck with him. At the very *least* propose a prenup and see how he reacts. Anyone is entitled to ask for one, but after this little tirade, you are especially justified in doing so. If he goes off at you again, you’ve definitely got your answer on why he’s marrying you, sadly. Full disclosure, my husband and I did not get one, but on the other hand, my husband never acted like this.

My read on this: your fiancé now feels free to verbally go off at you and to finally express his full, awful, entitled feelings, because he thinks you’re stuck with him. After all, you’re pregnant with his child and practically married to him already. You’d already be legally bound to him if it weren’t for the pandemic. I bet the marriage is just a technicality in his head right now. But he’s wrong. You’re not stuck with him, and wouldn’t be even if the marriage had happened already. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m not saying they *can’t*. I’m saying that Black people on average are more often (not always) forced into those situations due to systemic discrimination that prevents them from getting start up capital as easily and in the amounts that white people do (again, on average, not always). This lack of start up capital results in it just being harder to maintain a business aesthetically. There’s a reason high-income areas tend to look nicer than low-income ones (more $ to spare on lawn care, more regular re-painting, etc.). If you can only afford real estate in a low-income neighborhood, your primary customer base won’t have as much money to spend in your business. And people from higher-income neighborhoods avoiding lower-income ones based on “appearance” and *perception* of safety problems, regardless of actual crime rates, is very unfortunately a thing that happens. None of these are things that are caused by black people themselves; they are things caused by the system that discriminates against them.

For instance, discrimination by banks when giving business loans has historically been a huge issue— they just do it based on zip code or other things that are *correlated* with race, but isn’t race itself (much like how school zone lines in many US cities *just happen* to wind their way around black/brown neighborhoods in a way that *just happens* to essentially racially segregate schools— as an aside, inequitable access to education and its correlation with ability to start a business also dovetails with this. It’s harder to start a business if you were at a high school that didn’t have enough math textbooks to go around. People can do it, but it’s harder than it would have been for someone that had access to better educational resources. Many of these poorly-funded school systems *just happen* to be in black and brown neighborhoods... by design of a discriminatory system that found a workaround for segregation). </TEXT>

<TEXT> To some degree, yes, I think, although I think most people phrase it as “It’s not in a great part of town,” or “It seems kind of shabby” and don’t realize those disqualifiers push out a lot of minority-owned businesses. Since a lot of black entrepreneurs don’t have, on average, the same amount of startup capital as white people (ON AVERAGE), their businesses are often in lower-income areas that don’t look as good. Being in a lower income area also means their primary customer base isn’t spending as much as people in higher-income areas do, so it’s harder to turn a profit as quickly. And they also don’t have as much money to put into making the business itself look/feel as nice.

There’s a hole in the wall BBQ place about near us that happens to be black-owned in a black-majority part of town that is lower-income. Lots of people drive by it and are vaguely aware of it though, since it’s on a major commuting road near the highway. I recommend it to people (white people; I’m also white), and most times I hear something like “really? The building doesn’t look that great.” One person even asked me if it was “safe.” I think I would have been one of those ignorant people a few years ago before I moved over here. Glad I learned better.

Edit: copy/pasting a below comment I made elaborating on the above. My above post may have been unclear. Sorry.

Yes, Snape was always on the side of the Phoenix, but for many, he would always be the guy that killed Dumbledore, no matter what his reasons. I am sure there were many people who finished that war believing that all Slytherins were bad and were hoping that one day they could get their pound of flesh somehow. Giving their son a that name was the greatest symbol of peace that Harry and Ginny could impart to all those who followed, loved, and/or hated their post-war celebrity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an extremely unusual name (one that is only now just barely gaining traction; as in, I’ve now heard of— not met— 2 children born in the last decade who have it, but spelled differently. I’m in my 30s now). It is also Western European in origin. I get comments on it every time I introduce myself (usually that it’s so pretty, or that it’s so unusual), and I’ve had a drivers license misspelled (among other documents). I had a teacher unable to pronounce it for multiple *years* for some reason. My parents also have very common names. My experience sounds pretty comparable to this post. And... I disagree with most of what OP is saying. While I’m not a fan of you-nique names that are spelled weird just because, I still have no issue with names that are simply unusual. I like my name, even if it has sometimes been the source of trouble for me. Once I tell people the pronunciation, they (almost) always get it down going forward, or maybe need one more correction, even if they don’t spell it right.

However, I’m NOT saying OP is wrong. Her experience is valid and just different from mine, and it’s worth considering if you’re naming a child. But I’m just saying that experiences like mine are also worth considering— not everyone with an unusual name has such a bad experience with it.

Edit: it occurred to me to add that my sister has a  common name (our names go well together as a set though). She disliked being one of several girls with her name in every class. She disliked her name enough that she started going by something else as an adult. So you just never know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No idea about prenups in the medical community (we did not do one), but one-way prenup is an absolute no if they have agreed she will not work outside the home to take care of the home and potential children. By one-way, I assume you mean that she walks away with nothing if the marriage goes south. She will be bringing value to the house and to her future husband through the labor in the home, especially if there are kids involved. And she will be sacrificing years of building a resume and building up her earning potential in a traditional job. A prenup that protects her future husband should also protect her. If the marriage were to go south, she should at least be protected for the time it would take her to find a job and to build up her earning potential some (aka alimony for a set period to be negotiated).

I don’t have much experience in the family law field, but she should absolutely seek out her own attorney to talk this through. Under NO circumstances should she sign one without running it by a lawyer first. This is 10000% non-optional if her SO hands her something to sign. I am not an attorney, but work in law and know enough to know that with a contract like this, all parties should have their own attorney involved. Always.

If her SO is seriously suggesting a prenup where she walks away with nothing after raising his children, that is a major red flag. </TEXT>

My husband’s residency program was pretty big, and I became close with a number of his female co-residents, and was friends with a lot of the male ones as well. Like, I hung out with them all a lot both with and without my husband. I never heard of any of this happening. Sure, there was some relationship drama among them all, but nothing inappropriate.
Edit: to be clear, I’m not saying this doesn’t happen at all at our hospital (it’s a large institution in the year 2020; it statistically probably has to be happening, unfortunately) or at other places. Just that, if it’s happening at yours so much that you’ve heard of so many incidents in the short time you’ve been there, that may indicate a deeper problem than other places. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you have another room where your partner can sleep, that will go along way towards helping. Back when we were in a smaller apartment, he would sleep on an air mattress in our apartment’s living room since we only had one bedroom. We invested in a good, comfortable air mattress. Once we moved into a house, we got a second bedroom that he now sleeps in when necessary. Also, a white noise machine can help your sleep a lot once you get used to it. Also, melatonin. Find the 1 or 2 mg pills, and if you get woken up in the middle of the night pop one if it’s before four hours before you have to wake up. that is an extremely small dosage. You may have to experiment with dosage and accept that you’ll be a little bit drowsy when waking up, but it wears off very, very quickly once you’re up.

As for picking up so much housework, meal prep and prepared frozen foods go along way towards helping my sanity. We are big fans of Trader Joe’s frozen section. Take out would probably also fill the same need. And as for housework, do what you can during those rough times and realize that your house does not need to be perfect. When I got a promotion at work, which also came with longer hours, we decided to put some of that money towards a once per month house cleaner. I never thought that I would prioritize something like that, but it helps so, so much. This doesn’t mean that your SO doesn’t help at all. Like, he can put his own dishes in the dishwasher and stuff, and single physicians make it work all the time.

Finally, as for helping yourself stay sane, do your best not to drive yourself nuts trying to plan your life around his schedule when it gets too crazy. If you’re hungry, and he’s not coming home anytime soon, eat dinner yourself. If friends invite you to grab evening drinks, and he’s not off yet to leave with you, just go— if he wants to go when he’s off, he can meet you there. And finally, this is maybe a dumb one, find TV shows that are YOUR TV shows to binge when he’s gone at night. No waiting for him to be there until you can watch. Shows that are just for you. </TEXT>

The one really big factor you haven’t mentioned: presumably he’ll wear masks when seeing patients, but is he wearing a mask at all times in the hospital— seriously, all times except for gabbing food/water away from others? Is everyone else doing the same? Because his colleagues who ARE seeing covid patients sound like his biggest risk point— my husband’s hospital has everyone in masks at all times for that reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn’t bring it up if they don’t. As long as he wears his mask when in the hospital (even when just with colleagues), and takes PPE seriously if he ends up dealing with covid positive or rule out cases, he should be fine. We know a physician who got it (most likely) from work, and it took her 2.5 months of seeing literally only covid cases 12+ hours per day, 3 weeks per month, most of that time in reused surgical masks (rather than N95s), to get a positive test. I mean, that is a hell of a lot of exposure before she finally managed to get it. After universal masks and safety protocols got in place, we don’t know of any other physicians who got it from work (we know a few who got it right at the beginning when safety protocols were still crazy).

Also, unless you’re in a major hotspot that’s overwhelmed, I’d be surprised if they throw a med student in with many (or any) covid/rule out cases. A lot of places are trying to limit the number of staff who has contact with those cases, which means no med students until a negative test comes back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are not selfish, but this is definitely bigger than just match. His family being there does change the situation from the usual match disagreement. Both of your feelings matter, and you aren’t a bad person for expressing yours. But at the end of the day, you both need to agree on where you live and not hold resentment against the other for it. That means a pretty deep heart to heart. But it sounds like he has not strongly expressed that he must stay there forever, so the situation is absolutely not hopeless.

Beyond everyone’s personal preferences, there are career issues affecting this: as has already been noted, he will not have any control over where he matches. He can only control where he applies and how he ranks, and given how competitive residency spots are, he absolutely should apply to as many places as he can afford, which definitely includes the local hospital that’s appropriate to his career path. Where he ranks it is another story, and that’s the discussion you two need to have. Even if he happily agrees to rank other places higher, you have to acknowledge that he probably needs apply locally, and that there is a chance he will match there, and there will be nothing that he could have done to prevent it. At that point you have to ask yourself whether the relationship is sustainable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many hospitals in the US are allowing covid positive parents to see, hold, and even breastfeed their infants with proper precautions— to emphasize: these are people who have HAD POSITIVE TESTS before/after labor. The WHO does not recommend separation, and the CDC, last I checked was neutral on the subject, again both with respect to confirmed cases. The best, most current research is showing that parents should, that the very least, be allowed to be in-room with the infant while 6ft away plus masks (this is what mine is doing). And if mothers are symptomatic but know they want to breastfeed, hospitals should do what they can to help them to pump so that the newborn can get started on breastmilk until breastfeeding is possible. None of that happened in this situation. The hospital is responsible for keeping up on current research and recommendations and failed to do so.

<TEXT> We go outside for walks pretty regularly, and I have just started going to stores wearing a mask during light hours. I drove 20 minutes to the nicer part of town where people seem to take a mask wearing more seriously at the stores. One of my coworkers that lives near us said the grocery store nearby had almost no one wearing masks, but the grocery store I went to last week in the nice part of town had every single customer and employee wearing masks. Just because they all wanted to, not because the store forced them. We also see my parents pretty regularly, but they take social distancing seriously. I have also started doing some outdoor social distance socializing with a friend or two that I trust. But 100% isolating myself was not going to be mentally sustainable for me. I wish I was stronger, but I was losing it. I am so much happier now that I am doing just a little bit. However, I will probably go into pretty strict quarantine starting four weeks before my due date per my OB’s current recommendation.

Baby will stay quarantined for about six weeks. Grandparents are planning on socially isolating before my due date, and I think we are going to let them hold the baby with masks. Especially given that some hospitals are now not worried enough that they let Covid positive mothers breast-feed hours old babies. Walks will still happen as soon as I am able with the stroller/car seat totally covered. After six weeks, maybe will take maybe a few trips in a covered infant car seat to pick up coffee or something. Or to grandma and grandpa’s house for visits. But other than that, I can’t really imagine where I would want to take a baby that young. Even during normal times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bring it up yourself. It’s too big an issue for both of you to just leave it up to him. I wish I had just been more direct about what I wanted. We didn’t meet or get engaged until residency, but in our case, it was “just let me get through fellowship match.” We had that conversation under the assumption he would definitely match somewhere we would have to move to— we said we would get engaged before I moved with him. But then unexpectedly, he matched to the highly competitive program in our hometown. So it kind of felt like... well now what? I heard nothing from him for a couple months on the subject. I’d emotionally been willing to drop my whole life for him, and then nothing just because we got lucky in match location?!

The waiting and not knowing got to me and we ended up having the biggest fight we’ve ever had before or since, by far. I didn’t know that he had been working on it but had been delaying because some dumbasses on the internet told him he had to spend 6 months salary on the ring. He didn’t know that I’d been expecting it so soon after match. I wish I’d just calmly asked him, “okay, now that match is over, can we officially get engaged? I’d like it to happen in the next couple months. What do you think?” This is your life too; you get to have a say in how and when something as big as engagement happens. Don’t expect him to read your mind as to your preference on such a big thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We are having a baby girl in a few months, and all of the names that we like begin with S. The problem with that is that the middle name and last names both also begin with S— sounds similar to Solomon Sando. My husband and I have different last names, and my last name will become the baby’s middle name. This is not negotiable. The first names that we love are Sadie, Sylvia, and Susie (Susan). The only other names that have come close are Julia, Phoebe, and Melody, and we don’t like them *nearly* as much as any of the other three.

Is it too weird for someone to have a name that alliterative? I expect that her middle name won’t be used regularly, much like mine— just for paperwork/official things. And we aren’t looking for the worlds most perfect or lyrical baby name— We would be happy with one that sounds fine and isn’t too weird as long as WE like it. My instinct is to think that most people might say to her, “wow you got a lot of s-es there” and move on. My husband and I both have fairly unusual first names and have never been bothered by having the same quick conversation about them whenever we meet someone. But that is different than having an alliterative name... Naming a whole person is a big responsibility, and I’m starting to doubt my instincts. I’d appreciate input from others. </TEXT>

It’s a risk I’ve decided I want to take, but how on earth could I be a good person and force someone else to do the same against their will? On top of that, do you have any idea how cruel it is to force women to carry babies with non-viable conditions to term? I know a woman who was forced to do that, and it BROKE her. She was admitted to a psychiatric hospital both before and after birth— multiple times afterwards plus a suicide attempt. Not only that, it was cruel to the baby, who was in constant pain from the moment he developed nerve endings until the moment he died a couple hours after birth— almost every bone in his body was broken over and over due to severe genetic defect. And you think that it is kind to force that kind of pregnancy to term. So yeah, YTB, but not for not dating her. You did her a favor. But YTB for having such awful, horrific views. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it’s dependent on what the condition is, and the parent’s personal experience with it. Like, I have a metabolic condition where I can’t properly metabolize a lot of medications. I got it from my mother, who did not realize she had it until well after I was born. My sister has it too. It does not really affect our day-to-day lives and only comes into play when We have to take prescriptions or OTC cold medicine. And even then, I have alternatives, I just have to do more work to figure out which medicines I can and cannot take. There are a lot of common ones I cannot take. I am currently pregnant, and we just have to do a little bit more studying of the meds to figure out how I’ll go through labor. It is definitely doable, and my doctor just wants us to be prepared but she’s not worried about it.

There’s a good chance I will pass this on to my children. But I know for a fact it is possible to live a full, healthy, and happy life with this. It is just not a huge deal if you manage it correctly, and in general, it doesn’t take a whole lot of management. I know this from personal experience and don’t think it’s unreasonable to risk passing it on to a child.

But that is my specific condition with my specific experience. Passing on something more severe, particularly without a lived experience AND thoughtful consideration of that experience, may be selfish. Like, if someone considers their experience, realizes it has been very hard and just wants a child to share it with/wants a child no matter what, that’s probably selfish. </TEXT>

Your SO and maybe you will likely need to travel for residency interviews, and very likely for fellowship and/or attending interviews a few years after that. The Chase Sapphire card (lower tiered) is a good travel card with a decent sign up bonus— it helped my husband pay for his fellowship interviews. It’s $99 per year but more than pays for itself in points. There are other cards out there too, but I’m not as familiar with them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Be VERY careful with this though. I know at least for prescription drugs, or some of them, generics are often manufactured in China, where quality control and factory inspections are not as good— at least for the stuff that they export. There have been published medical studies comparing certain brand names to their generic counterparts, and the generics don’t perform either as well, as consistently, or both. In delicate health conditions this can have extremely severe effects. My endocrinologist will not put pregnant women on the generic of Synthroid for this reason, because she has had way too many people have problems with the variation and dose from the generic. She prefers all of her patients on the brand-name, but she’s a specially careful about it with her pregnant patients since low thyroid can really screw up a developing baby. It’s just coincidental this came up in my personal life. My additional source for this is that I had to do a big research project in this for my job assisting at attorney who advises clients on multi-employer insurance plans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTB. I am pregnant and was on bed rest for 6 weeks during the height of the pandemic due to hyperemesis. I was too sick to cook, heat up food, or even bathe myself. Fortunately, I was mostly able to hold down liquids. That’s what saved me from going to the hospital. But intitially, my OB said that if we were careful, my mom could come help me during the day if I needed it. Like you, my husband was working during the days, so I was alone. I never let on to my mom how bad it got.

In retrospect, now that I’m out of it, I seriously regret not taking my mom and my OB up on that. Like you, I felt morally conflicted and toughed it out myself. This is my first time being pregnant, and I just didn’t realize how bad it was until I started getting better. I think I put my health and my babies health at risk by not accepting the help. My mom is in good health, and it’s now pretty clear to me that I was at a much bigger risk of winding up in the hospital then she was. Accept the help. It sounds like you have a really great sister. </TEXT>

At one point in elementary school, Marika and her parents moved to Uruguay for a few months, where they discovered her name is apparently slang for “lesbian.” They changed her name to Maria while they were down there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is not normal. I take a pretty liberal view when it comes to people using water—I think it depends on where you live and where you get your water from. If you live in a really rainy area and your water source is plentiful, go ahead and get that crazy multi-headed shower. Water your lawn if it makes you happy and you’re willing to pay a little extra for it. But if you live in an area that experiences water shortages, don’t be an asshole and conserve your water.

But I don’t care where you live, leaving your tap running for hours, or even several minutes,  is stupid and weird unless your pipes are in danger of freezing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, they do match, but so what? People will occasionally be like, “Aw, they rhyme!” And you’ll say something like, “Yeah, they do! We just loved the name and it happened to match.” It’s not the kind of thing people will judge you for in real life (aka outside of a sub specifically meant for deep analyzing names— and here people are only nitpicking because you asked them to, not because they are being judgey or mean).

I have a friend who happened to give her kids rhyming names. They just happen to be the only names that both she and her husband liked. They had some minor reservations about the rhyming, but they went ahead and did it anyway. It is seriously not a big deal at all. I know people mentioned it a few times after they had the second baby, but it wasn’t in a negative or judgey way. And their kids don’t even have nicknames that would prevent people from noticing like yours would. People notice and get over it, because it’s not that big a deal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My husband‘s best friend in the world is finishing med school soon, and like everyone else, he does not get a graduation ceremony. He is across the country, but my husband and him have been close since they were six. We love him and are so proud of him. Everyone works hard in med school, and he’s no different. He is  one of the kindest people in the world, and my husband truly would not be who he is today without him. He is family to us. We have been wracking our brains to figure out a gift we can mail to him, but just haven’t come up with anything that seems good enough for such a huge achievement. My husband is now in fellowship, and even though he was once graduating med school, he doesn’t have any ideas.

Does anyone here have any ideas? It doesn’t have to be expensive if we can come up with something meaningful. But we are also willing to spend some if we think of something great. Any help would be hugely appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not the doctor, but my husband is. At our wedding, the best man fell onto the floor in excruciating pain because he dislocated his knee. A few of my panicked relatives yelled out “We need a doctor!”

My husband and about 10 of his friends/co-workers came over. By the time they got there, it was over, because the best man was a fourth-year medical student and had just put his own knee cap back in place. Everyone else just kind of stood there calmly while my husband helped him up. Things I heard: “well I don’t know what to do, I am a neurologist.” And another said “what? I don’t do ortho.” Those 10 doctors were basically useless for the situation, because they were all neurology or internal medicine. Probably also because the best man seemed to have it well in hand almost immediately. The extent of assistance the he got was that my husband went and got him a beer. He rested his knee for a little bit and then got back to the dance floor. Carefully. We heard he was out with the rest of the wedding party until three in the morning. Good times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is pretty spot on. Some parents are just worriers and discouraging, but if there’s a chance her mom’s worries have merit, it’s something to consider. Not just for getting through med school, which is tough, but for residency, too, which is really mentally and even physically demanding in terms of endurance. I had to drop out of training for a high-demand career (law school) due to a severe health condition. It was so, so hard to make that decision, but it was for the best in the long run.

But if you and your girlfriend are confident in her health, be her cheerleader and give her support. Encourage her to put her mother on an information diet to keep the discouragement to a minimum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Your husband sounds like an asshole. It sounds like he thinks he’s better than you and that his career is the be-all end-all of life. Guess what? If he missed one or two points on a test because he decided to prioritize you/his marriage for an hour or two instead of studying, he would still get to be a doctor and he still gained something, even if that something wasn’t test points. It’s called work-life *balance.* Ultimatums in marriage are usually bad, but in this case, it sounds 1) necessary, since you’ve tried everything else; and 2) not an empty threat; you sound serious about divorce in this post. Tell him that he needs to find time for couples therapy immediately or he needs to move out so that divorce proceedings can start. Be clear about your intention to move forward with separation. Meanwhile, focus on your schooling and don’t feel pressured to put effort into a relationship that’s giving very little back to you.

I know from experience that finding therapy appointments can be hard if you’ve got a 9-5/medical schedule, so definitely consider online options if nothing local works— something with a real-time video therapy, not just text (the american psychological association supports video therapy but finds no basis for text therapy being successful). </TEXT>

But he just assumed you would know to check the back door, and he had no way of knowing you would come home in an emergency bathroom situation. He had no idea you were pregnant (PS I am pregnant now, and I totally get the “need bathroom now” thing). He should NOT have said “it wasn’t that bad” or downplayed your experience. That’s just mean, although I do wonder how you approached the situation. His response wouldn’t be surprising if you put him on the defensive, although he still shouldn’t have said it. However, you did overreact over a simple miscommunication where he did do what you asked in the most sensible way— it just wasn’t what you expected. This was not worth not talking for four days. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having a lot of family not show up would in fact be less fun. OP is changing her wedding date to accommodate her guests (she specifies that’s in comments), so I don’t know why you think she should plan better. She DID plan, and she clearly has family on multiple continents, so moving locations solves nothing— and I say this as someone who had to plan a wedding with guests from four continents/half a dozen countries (including a sibling on each side). We planned around people’s ability to travel to and from the wedding (both domestically and internationally), family’s school and final exams, and what we figured a lot of people would do for holidays. Would we have preferred a spring or summer wedding? Yes, but our family is more important, so we made it work. We had a winter wedding for family, not ourselves. And it was wonderful. I wouldn’t change a thing. All but a very small handful of friends/family were able to be there because of the date we chose.

And yeah finding new dates is difficult, but a date far enough out could fix that. Instead she chose a closer date that obviously screws over her family. I would never, ever do that to my sister. Never. Not even under these admittedly crappy global circumstances. I’d rather have a small legal ceremony and do a bigger wedding later than make my sister choose between having our family at her wedding and changing her wedding date. I know a family where a sibling made the choice to delay his wedding rather than make family choose between him or his brother— they both just happened to get engaged close in time. But that’s what you do for family. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a winter wedding. Dead of winter, in a cold climate. It was great. We picked a date that not only worked for us, but that worked for other people (including some international family), because we wanted our families at our wedding. I doubt SIL did it out of spite, but it was inconsiderate. Booking before OP’s wedding will definitely make some people less enthusiastic going to the second wedding, particularly because in her case, a lot of the family will be international travelers. She fixed her own problem by making it her brother’s problem instead. I could never see myself doing something like that to my own sibling. If you share international family with one of the four couples, and you chose a date closely before ones already set that will force that family to choose which wedding they go to, what you are doing is also inconsiderate. Like, maybe it’s fine if they are second cousins or if you have a ton of first cousins where these kind of conflicts tend to happen. But to your own sibling? That’s pretty bad.

Edit: *closely* before, not just before the other wedding date </TEXT>

 I don’t think OP is the asshole, but I think the sister-in-law is. I get that it’s a shitty situation, but the sister not only moved her wedding close to OP’s,  forcing guests to choose between the two, she chose a date shortly before OP’s, which increases the chances that people will choose hers. It would be different had she chosen a date more than six months before or after, and/or if international guests were not involved (whichOP indicates in the comments). Having weddings close together isn’t always bad, but in this case it is. I know a set of twins that got married within four months of each other, but only domestic travelers were involved, and most of the family didn’t have to travel for one of the weddings.

But as things stand, I don’t blame OP for sounding a touch petty in the post. I am shocked she only sounds petty and not infuriated. She is also taking an incredibly  high road by offering to change her own date rather than confronting the sister in law about her complete lack of consideration for her family (OP/her brother and all of her relatives who will have to choose). Honestly, OP sounds not only reasonable, but kind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) Warring Goa’ulds take over each other’s planets (it’s basically their only hobby), and they don’t know all of the planets the others had. This happens *a lot*. We see at least 4 instances of Goa’ulds being imprisoned or stuck on *just on Earth* for thousands of years. And those are just the ones we know about (and the ones from the show I can think of off the top of my head). Many of the planets they had were likely forgotten.

2)Additionally, Goa’ulds that lose ships and Jaffa troops in battle cannot afford to keep up on every planet they previously seeded with slaves, even if they don’t technically lose the territory or entirely forget about it. This must happen pretty regularly, given how often they all go to war with each other.

3) they abandon the human colonies after the resource they wanted on that planet becomes scarce.

4) they drop off human slaves to look for resources on a promising planet, find out it’s a dead end, and abandon them very quickly. Humans are plentiful and herding them through a gate is easy, so it’s not a huge investment of resources.

5) a few of those human civilizations figure out the stargate and migrate on their own— just one civilization with gate travel could spread to dozens of worlds or more.

6) Without written history, at least in the early stages of each planet’s development, how the humans got there quickly passes into legend/religion, and in some cases is simply forgotten. This was likely particularly the case on planets that were more quickly abandoned.

7) Goa’uld don’t really care what humans do because of their hubris. It is entirely possible that some of them have come to believe that they are actual gods, or might as well be, given how much “better” they are than humans. They treat humans sort of how we treat deer. We never worry deer are going to develop technology and destroy us, and they are around when need them for the resource they provide (in this case, food). The big difference there is that we don’t think that we are gods to the deer. So the Goa’uld see no problems with just abandoning human planets to their own devices until such time as they are needed. The Goa’uld learn they were wrong too late.

8) The general population of Goa’ulds is very small compared to humans, either due to genetics, or more likely, due to them purposefully limiting their own reproduction in order to prevent future competition to their immortal selves. This backfires when humans have to take out relatively few Goa’uld to basically take out the entire parasitic species. A side effect of this limited reproduction is that they have few “generals” or “demigods” to keep their species/godhood present in the minds of all the human planets they previously took over. And the Goa’uld don’t seem interested in visiting boring backwater planets in person regularly when they don’t actually have to in order to take what they want when they want it.

9) a goa’uld lifespan Is immortal so long as they have a supply of hosts. They may think nothing of abandoning a planet for 1000 years or more. While that is a long time in human years, it is not long in an immortal life span. We see multiple Goa’uld get woken up after a few thousand years and not think much of how long they were gone. They’re just like, “oh what is Ra up to now? Oh he’s dead? Excellent, just give me a minute to get my troops together.”

This ended waaaay up longer than I thought because I’m bored, stuck in bed, and this was interesting to think through. Thanks for reading if you got this far. If you didn’t, well this was fun for me. </TEXT>

They also have ridiculous looking covers, and I avoided them for a long time because of that. They have a little bit of a romance plot, but mostly they are about a kick ass lead character in a well built urban fantasy world (post-apocalyptic Atlanta) with a unique magic system. They hold up well, and I’d definitely recommend them. I think there are a few sex scenes in them, but I didn’t find them disturbing (unlike the ones described in this post), and they definitely did not become the focus of the books in any way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTB. Abso-fucking-lutely not. His parents could kill your baby, or land him or her in the NICU. They could cause you to catch it, causing you to be quarantined from your child after birth (this is a thing that is happening! I’m pregnant and my OB told me this). Your husband needs to give his head on straight and realize that his priority is now this baby. Not his parents. Not them ever again. If he overrides you and tells them to come anyway, this would be grounds to start looking at separating. I know that is scary at the worst ever time for that, but YOUR priority is now that baby too. Whatever it takes to keep that baby AND yourself safe (because YOU are a priority too). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! I just rewatched this and completely agree. I didn’t notice the first time I watched years ago, but now that I’ve been a manager for a few years, Weir’s management of him initially was *terrible*. You don’t call out a subordinate in front of people like that, and that’s definitely not how you give feedback. She managed him poorly starting with the puddle jumper episode and it just got worse from there. Even if he was being a little pessimistic and annoying, she basically did everything she could as a manager to make the situation worse.

I still don’t like the guy though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like OP is leaving something out, if this is even a real post. I could believe it if she just got messages from the bride/groom, along with a few other  wedding party and/or family members. But she said random GUESTS were messaging her. Something had to have happened for that many people to take the effort to message someone they don’t even know that well (since they are connected to the wedding through her partner). Maybe she said something when she thought she was on mute, or at best, this is a case of mistaken identity, and people somehow got her mixed up with someone else... on zoom... which has name labels. Maybe this dress showed more cleavage in her than on the model (especially since OP is pregnant) and she was almost flashing the camera. But that sounds like a stretch too. I don’t know, but I’m calling BS on this one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We bought when my husband started a 3 year fellowship— roughly the same salary as residency. I was working and slightly outearned him at the time (still do, since he’s not done). We bought because there is a high chance we would be staying after fellowship was over. My family is from here, his is driving distance, and there are employment opportunities here for him. However, we knew that there was also a decent chance we would have to leave the city for him to get a job in his specialty, because that’s how things shake out sometimes. But we bought in an area where houses sell quickly, and we would likely be able to sell it at a profit— or at least, not at much of a loss— if we had to move at the end of 3 years.

My advice: Heavily consider the market you were in and whether there is a chance he would stay after residency. In some markets, it may not even matter if you stay, because real estate might be that hot. Also consider the intangible value to you. Are you willing to potentially end up paying a little extra to not have to deal with a landlord? Not going to lie, that did factor into our decision. Finally, also factor in the amount of time (and $ above mortgage) it takes to keep after a house. It can require a lot of maintenance and logistics even when in good condition. Some people value not having to deal with that and would rather just pay a landlord to do it. There are some days I kind of wish we could just call someone and say “hey please deal with this” but mostly I am happy with our decision. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A resident is a doctor, but they are still in training— but mostly hands-off training, as they are done with med school. What you do not want is a first year resident (also known as an intern). ESPECIALLY if you deliver in July, August, or September— all the new residents start in July in the US. And as this comment said, DO NOT let a med student put a needle anywhere near your spine. Personally, unless I got a 2nd+ year resident, I would ask for a resident with more experience or for the attending, who is the more experienced doctor supervising the resident cases. You may not see the attending much, but they do get reports on your case— a good attending gives residents a decent amount of independence. Don’t feel bad about asking your doctors where they are in their training, and don’t feel bad about requesting someone with more— I know doctors who are patients (or whose family are patients) do it when the stakes are high. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP, I think you should talk to a family law attorney NOW about how to best protect your child going forward. A man who went to the lengths your ex has should not ever be allowed custody. Things you do now can protect you years down the road. Your ex could do a 180 Right after birth or 10 years from now and try to sue you for custody. Based on what you have said about him, your child should not be with him, particularly in the near future. I think talking to an attorney needs to be a priority for you right now to make sure you have everything lined up at the birth. First, so you know how to handle the birth certificate, and second so that you are prepared in case he suddenly decides he wants to play dad. You need to give up on him entirely, because he is not a safe person for your baby or for you. I’m really sorry you have to deal with this, especially given how hard your pregnancy has been and how close you are to birth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You messed up. You may consider her your immediate family on every sense of the word, but it sounds like you are putting her in the position of “Treat me exactly like family or we can’t be friends.” The thing is, she has family obligations that she has to consider too. That sounds harsh but I can’t think of another way to put it. You are a friend— a very, very close one, but you can’t force her to choose you as literal family just because you choose her. It sounds like she was out in a tough spot and hoped you would understand as her friend, but instead you acted the same, if not worse, than the jerks in her family. And she’s now got even more family obligations as she’s getting married, and in-laws can be a tricky situation, especially at the beginning of a relationship/marriage.

And she tried to make it right as soon as the opportunity arose. Instead of maybe talking to her about your feelings and accepting the olive branch, you slapped it away and ended the entire relationship. I’d feel disappointed and upset about her actions in your position— you’re allowed to have feelings, and they are valid. But you can control your actions. To throw away a friendship over this? That’s an overreaction. Most of us are lucky to find one close friendship in our lives like the one it sounds like you had. Why is a close friendship not good enough? Why does it have to be “sister or nothing”?

Edit: also, one point I haven’t seen mentioned is that if her parents are paying for the wedding, or even part of it, they would get significant input on the guest list. If they are assholes (sounds like they are), situations like this happen. This payment structure is a VERY common situation, and your friend would have little control over it beyond cancelling the wedding, which would likely sever her relationship with her parents and other family members. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Get copies of those comments!! Names, date of comment, what they said. I pull this kind of information for attorneys all the time, and this is often the exact kind of information they want from me. You’ve already got the videos, but the comments can be very, very helpful.

Also, if you can go further back in her social media timeline, do so ASAP and download anything that looks remotely relevant. As another poster said, she actually could have been seriously injured in January but well enough in April to have a legitimate (sounding) claim. It really depends on the type of injury/effect on her life they are trying to claim damages for.

Edit: also, if you can find her Twitter, in my experience, that’s often where the gold is, even moreso than Facebook. Search her name on Twitter— lots of people use their real one there for some reason. Also try reverse image searching her Facebook profile pic. Lots of people use the same one across platforms. If that doesn’t work, you can also try to backtrack to her Twitter profile by searching the names of the people who were also there/commented on Facebook and see if they tagged her on twitter. Check the other commenters’ accounts back to the date of the injury to see if they have pictures/videos of her since they are friends. I know of more than one defendant who was sunk because no one thought to tell their friends to delete incriminating stuff off *their* social media. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Delta didn’t cancel my international flight until 5 days before. In your case, they may be waiting to see if borders open back up. But mine was to the U.K., where there are no travel restrictions other than common sense, and they still cancelled. I would wait it out if I were you. If they do not cancel within a few days before, call them (and be prepared for long hold time). If they don’t agree to refund, I’ve seen on other Reddit threads that in situations like like yours— where the destination country has closed its borders— credit card companies have been willing to issue a chargeback for services not rendered in that specific circumstance. I’ve heard elsewhere that this means delta may not let you fly/pay with credit in the future, but I don’t know enough about the system to know for sure.

On the other hand, Delta is allowing people to use their flight credits through May 2022, which is 2 years out. So if you are going to travel again within that time frame, Delta is probably the best airline you could be stuck with credits for. Most other airlines are 3 months-1 year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He wants you to screw with your hormones— SOMETHING YOU HAVE ALREADY TRIED— and he won’t use condoms because of “the typical reasons”? No. Those reasons are not even remotely equivalent. I’ve tried so many birth controls, and they make me depressed and like I’m someone else. I know they work for some people, and that’s great, but they are awful for others. You sound like you’re one of those people.

One thing you might consider is an IUD. It stopped working for me because my uterus has an unusual anatomical defect that caused it to fall out of place, but while it worked, it was great. I had a VERY low hormone one— it’s direct application, so it’s much, much lower than even the lowest oral contraceptive. There is also a hormone-free one but it causes heavier periods/cramps. I tried that one too initially, and it was also good before it fell out of place (my issue is rare). I think I preferred the one with low-dose hormones, though, which surprised me.

BUT getting an IUD in is invasive and somewhat painful, and not always free (both mine were, though). It’s not the right call for everyone. Don’t do it just because he wants you to. At the end of the day, birth control and IUDs are invasive. Condoms are not. If he won’t use condoms and demands you mess with your body and your physical health, you should break up. </TEXT>

Keep up that attitude and maybe after quarantine is lifted, you’ll have to do everything too, after she leaves you in search of a husband who respects her.  FFS “pretty pictures” how patronizing can you be? Your wife, by your admission, works more than you do both at her paid job and housework. She may be home, but she is working. Honestly, it sounds like you should be doing even more around the house than just the cooking. And also, she is just as at risk as you are for getting sick since she shares a house with you. She is just as scared. You don’t get a monopoly on the emotional tax of this global crisis. Step up, apologize to your wife, and be better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This seems like the most balanced answer here. OP did mess up, but it’s worth noting that it’s not solely her actions that contributed to the breakdown in the relationship, which is likely going to end. Mature, supportive, and loving partners don’t refuse to talk to their SO for days on end— that’s is asking for trouble in a relationship just as much as what OP did. It’s not worth pointing fingers during the breakup that will inevitably happen, but this is an additional important thing for OP to know going forward, as well as the issues on her considering how she deals with perception/one-upping others have already mentioned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holy shit. Break up with him. His behavior is a very serious threat to your mental and physical health, and he’s emotionally blackmailing you in an attempt to make you behave how he wants you to (“do what I want or I’ll leave you”). Ditch him, block him. Never talk to him again. This guy is actively trying to hurt you.

If you have a therapist, please talk to them about how you handle boundaries and your mental health in relationships. This isn’t to blame you for being in this relationship; I’ve been in one with a guy similar to this one and had to learn from it with the help of a therapist. It was hugely helpful and allowed me to look for a healthy and supportive relationship. But you deserve better, and you deserve to have the tools to protect yourself when getting into relationships in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The second time I met all of my now-husband’s friends— his co-residents— it was at a bar where we played trivia. All 7 of them were pretty much USELESS at every question except for one that asked the number of human bones, and one of them got a couple sports questions. Other than that, it was all me. I carried that team. For years, they kept saying how great it was to have someone from outside medicine in the group— and not just for trivia purposes. This isn’t to brag about my trivia ability (tbh I’m not that good and that bar had easy questions, so the residents’ performance was especially terrible). More to the point: we all are smart in our own ways. You have your strength; your SO has ones that are different from yours. And sometimes your strengths will be much more useful than his. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the original post, the guy told her he was 19 and even continually talked about attending college classes. 19 was a reasonable age for someone her age to date.

Then when she broke up with him, he turned around and told her he was 17, that he’d recorded them having sex, and that if she didn’t let him have sex with her again, he would use the tape to get her in trouble with the police. Then, he likely saw her original post on Reddit and fessed up that he was indeed 19 and *that he had lied about being 17 after she broke up with him to force her into sex with him.* She was the victim here. He tried to extort her and attempted a sexual crime against her. He likely fessed up because multiple people pointed out that he had committed a VERY serious crime, while she had committed none even in the event he actually was 17– which, again, he wasn’t. He was 19 the whole time, just as he originally told her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is not immature to be concerned that some parents decision to name their kid a ridiculous drug name might cost our business hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars, if we choose to put that name in a public position in association with our company. We have to be concerned that other people will judge it and judge our business for choosing to be associated with it. Do I trust every potential client out there to make the right call? No, no I do not. And again, there is a not small probability that this resume gets tossed out for being fake. Since so much is automated and forced certain formatting, inserting the middle name in there will likely not fix the problem. This is a very serious problem, and her parents should absolutely change the name while she still young. And they should buy that cousin a very nice gift for saving their daughter a lifetime of unnecessary obstacles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me be clear: I review resumes. I am not the sole decision-maker, but I have a lot of input in hiring entry-level positions. I would have concerns about putting a young person with that name on our client-facing website, and some older people I work with would have significantly stronger concerns than mine. We would have to be concerned about what our clients would think and whether it would cause prospective clients to give other businesses more consideration than they otherwise would have. Would it cause them to question our judgment, even the tiniest amount? It would be a serious topic of discussion before going forward with her paperwork, and if there was an equally-good candidate with another name, I would take them over her, because hiring that name is a business risk— a very pointless, stupid risk. I would seriously wonder why she hadn’t changed her name the second she turned 18, and what her parents were thinking.

Enough people on this thread of commented that these concerns are clearly widespread enough to be a problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work for an employer in an industry that would care, and I can think of several other industries that would care too. It wouldn’t bar her from getting hired, but if she were one of two good applicants, we’d hire the young person that *wouldn’t* make our clients associate our serious business with drugs or ridiculous industry-inappropriate humor. It sucks, and it’s not fair, but her name is a real problem for situations involving client perception, especially at the beginning of her career as an intern or new hire out of college. And that’s without mentioning the fact that I’d seriously consider throwing out a resume with that name at the top just because it would look like a joke resume, which does occasionally happen.

And consider that the people who are most familiar with the slang term now (Gen Z and some Millennials I think,) will be the ones in hiring/screening positions in 16-22 years when Molly is applying to college, entering the work force, etc. Even if it isn’t common slang in the future, that generation will have strong associations with the term— and that is assuming it actually falls out of use. Several people on this thread have pointed out that rolling on molly has been in use in some populations for a couple of decades now, and it has only grown in popularity. </TEXT>

All that being said... I got the Molly Roll reference immediately. It’s... not good and WILL limit her employment choices, if it doesn’t have limiting effects in her life earlier than that. In the future, employers that rely on client perception for business will be hesitant to hire a young professional with that name. I say that as someone who reviews resumes in that kind of business. Colleges (and employers, for that matter) may believe that she submitted a joke application, because the name sounds... it sounds ridiculous. I don’t say that to be harsh, but that is the reality of that name. The initials that get you to MJ Roll aren’t quite as bad, but there are some similar (albeit much lesser) concerns. But Molly Roll is definitely not good.

Your husbands cousin might be an idiot, but he did you a huge favor by flagging this. Change the name. I am sorry no one flagged this for you earlier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTB. So let me get this straight: your sister wants you to drive 4 hours and risk your health/your family’s health all because she can’t figure out grocery delivery? And then she goes tattling to your dad? Getting time slots is hard, but not impossible if you keep at it— especially if she is trying on multiple services. And she SHOULD be trying on multiple services at different times of day, because desperate times (Instacart regularly has same-day slots pop up if you keep watching, even when their scheduled-ahead slots are gone). Your health (and hers) is your primary concern. If she demands you sacrifice that due to her lack of motivation and (minimally required) creativity, then she doesn’t sound like someone you should have in your life without laying down boundaries and sticking to them— which you have done so far. Good. Text her your boundaries and what you are/aren’t willing to do. If she calls to argue, hang up. If your dad calls to argue on her behalf, tell him you have offered her alternatives that protect your healthy, and you will not discuss it further with either of them— and that you will be unable to talk to him until he stops interfering with your family’s safety. Keep to the boundary.

It’s okay if your relationship with her gets strained over this, even though it will feel hard. YOU ARENT THE ONE CAUSING IT. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know so many physicians that were getting this wrong as late as late February or, in a couple cases, early March. This guy wasn’t the only one. After things settle, I do think this crisis should demand a reflection within the medical community of what is considered legitimate information/news. Because the information necessary to make predictions was available from reputable non-scientific sources like newspapers.

So many people around the world, including on Reddit, were able to see how bad this would get earlier than many in the medical community, including people in charge of making widespread preparations. Meanwhile many physicians were waiting for scientific, peer-reviewed proof that this was going to be worse than the flu— but this virus was so new and spread so rapidly that there wasn’t time for much of that.

This isn’t to say that NO physicians got this right; many did. But a shocking number of them didn’t, and on paper, they are the ones that should have. The physicians I know who have their own PPE are, for the most part, not the ones who took this virus seriously back when you could get an N95 in stores still. With one exception, the ones who have it are the ones whose non-medical SPOUSES took it seriously and started making preparations on their own.

Obviously, that part is anecdotal, but I do think that later, the medical community needs to examine why they didn’t see this coming when anyone with access to news on the internet could put the basic puzzle pieces together. </TEXT>

Oh, really, they are and are getting treated for an STD? Good to know. I’m going to tell everyone we work with.” Or if your local insurance agent can just call up and say “and what are they in for? Oh, that’s too much, so we’re going to drop them before they can make a claim.”

The nurse is not responsible for telling everyone in the hospital who is and is not allowed to contact you, because nurses have more important things to do. Unless a hospital employee is certain you have given permission to tell the specific person who is asking, they cannot tell them you are there. End of story. </TEXT>

<TEXT> YTB, but mildly. Like really mildly. But they aren’t just endangering themselves. They are endangering the grocery store cashiers they will all see over the next couple weeks. The people they pass on the street. Their grandparents, and the store clerks’ grandparents. The doctors and nurses that will have to treat them, or someone they infect. My husband is in healthcare and is getting pulled into the front lines of this thing soon. I will have to move out of our home to isolate from him since I am pregnant. And worse,much worse, he could die by catching it from a patient. I’m terrified for him. When I see or hear people breaking quarantine, it’s enraging, because any one of them could be the one that infects my husband, and they are extending the amount of time we cannot live together. We have friends that are already treating people with this. There’s not enough protective gear, and two of our friends have been exposed and are awaiting results, but one is already showing symptoms. Their SOs have had to move into hotels for who knows how long. All because people think their right to party is more important than not getting other people killed.

Call the police. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The hospital is forbidden from giving anyone information about who is at the hospital and why due to HIPAA unless you sign explicit consent forms. Think of it this way: what if you were escaping an abusive relationship, and the hospital just up and told your abuser where you were? That’s one of may, many reasons they cannot reveal patient information. With respect to contacting your family, it sounds like this provider did everything 100% correctly. </TEXT>

I have a great-uncle who does, and unfortunately that means that my parents have had to quarantine apart for weeks and will continue to do so until May 1 (7 weeks total) when one of my aunts can relieve my dad.

Even though her test came out negative, she had no way of knowing that was the case. Don’t stay with someone who is so terrible. Even if she never showed any symptoms at all, the whole point of quarantine and flattening the curve is that she doesn’t come over at all.  Also, this behavior combined with quarantine is a free pass in a case like this to break up over the phone or via text or whatever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What most people are thinking of in terms of 3D printing are valves, not the entire ventilator machine. We need both, but the valves are relatively simple to produce, even if the ones that are being 3-D printed are not ideal; most 3-D printers do not have the precision and sterility you would want in an ideal situation. Obviously, that goes out the window when you’re dealing with a pandemic. But that’s just the valves.
The ventilator is an entire machine that actually IS complicated. MIT was apparently able to produce an actual ventilator, but the people who made it are talented engineers. And the one they produced is not guaranteed to work/work for as long as necessary in a hospital setting. If I needed a ventilator and only that one was available, I would try it, but the best option is to mobilize as quickly as possible to create the more complicated medical-grade ones that have already been proven effective and safe. Producing machines that complicated on a mass scale, or producing anything on a mass scale, is just inherently more complicated than a few individuals slowly making one or two or a dozen in the home.

Also, no one has been sued for 3-D printing valves. A bunch of new stories ran about that Italian company that was making them, but the guy who owns it came out and said that the original valve manufacturer had not threatened legal action, despite what the news was reporting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good point. Anything sent should be packaged and store-bought for this reason. The virus can survive on plastic for max 3 days, so anything store-bought should be good to go shortly after delivery. Things sent in packaging are also easy enough to wipe down or wash with soap if they are especially concerned. All the physicians I know will not eat home-baked goods from patients (and random people, I assume) even during normal times, so store-bought is the way to go right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, mostly they need food— as u/overheadSPIDERS  said, snacks and easy-to-make meals. They are in survival mode right now, according to a couple residents I know out there. Include some dried fruit/fruit cups— since they have trouble getting out for groceries due to hours, that many be the only fruit they get. Those alternatives aren’t ideal, but they’re better than no fruit at all. As far as snacks, go high-protein if possible: jerky, protein bars, nuts, etc. but some fun carb snacks are definitely welcome, too. Also, throw in a few cans of energy drink. Most physicians we know turn to them in desperate times, because sometimes you don’t have time to seek out and drink a coffee. As far as meals, here are things that work in desperate times: ramen, microwave rice, some of those microwaveable Indian food packets, canned soup (ideally the kind you can drink from the can, since time is very, very short sometimes. But canned soup in general is good). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know someone involved in the GM/Ventec deal. They explained it to me a couple days ago after they got pissed with Trump’s comments implying GM was dragging their feet. You can’t just magically turn a factory into a ventilator factory. It has to be a “clean” site that can be maintained to medical cleanliness standards. You have to hire extra people, since ventilators take more manpower, and you have to do intensive training with all the people who have never done it before— meaning Ventec/whatever ventilator company you’re using has to move people from THEIR ventilator production to the training site while their workforce is already strained— but they are making it happen. And this is on top of having to reconfigure all the machinery, which can’t be done overnight. It takes a massive amount of work to convert a factory, and you *must* partner with an already-existing ventilator manufacturer to make sure you are doing it right and don’t make something that will kill people.

So the fact that ANY factories have been reconfigured in such a short amount of time is miraculous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTB. Giving birth during this mess is already stressful enough on you, and your mother isn’t only being inconsiderate by making the stress worse. She is being cruel. I’m pregnant, and these times are terrifying. She’s also shown you that she’s willing to stoop to emotional blackmail to get you to do what she wants with your child. Red flag.

Tell her “I will not be recording the birth, as it makes me deeply uncomfortable. I wish you could be there, but I can’t control a pandemic. If you cannot respect my wishes and drop this, I am concerned that you will not respect my parenting wishes going forward. Your behavior now is cruel and disrespectful during an already stressful time, and it’s a red flag that I should not offer to share as much about our child’s life if you are going to use emotional blackmail to make it all about you. So drop this while you are ahead.”

Draw a line in the sand, and if she doesn’t immediately apologize, do not talk to her until well after labor. You don’t need that right now. If I were you, I wouldn’t just be sad about what she’s doing. I would be furious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She should talk to her state bar association not only about a complaint, but also for referrals to attorneys who handle legal malpractice claims. You’re not wrong in that a lot of attorneys don’t want to sue other attorneys, but it’s also a somewhat specialized area of law, so not all litigation attorneys have experience in it. On top of that, in a given community, some attorneys/their firms may have professional conflicts involving the bankruptcy guy, meaning they would be ethically barred from taking action against him. So it is not entirely surprising that she’s having trouble finding representation if she’s just cold calling attorneys. The state bar should be able to help. If not, you/she should specifically research “legal malpractice lawyer + your state” online. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are showing judgment that indicates they will have terrible judgment as physicians in the future. I ran this by two physicians and both said they would report these med students in a heartbeat. It’s unlikely they will   get kicked out of school based on this one instance, and if this ISNT the first instance, they aren’t cut out for the medical field and should be kicked out. However, they will likely face some threats and consequences that will hopefully make them realize that the rules surrounding the medical profession/public health aren’t just about them— it’s about protecting the vulnerable people, many of whom they will one day work with. But if they can’t follow basic health safety protocol now, they 100% should be barred from entering the medical profession. They could kill people with their cavalier attitude. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ETB. Your dad talked to you poorly, your mother shouldn’t have had you come home with no conditions given that you will not be able to self-isolate, and you should be taking the precariousness of your father’s health FAR more seriously. The fact is that by going to work and coming home, you are risking your father’s health. The social distancing 6 ft rules are to mitigate, but they aren’t 100% protective, especially if you and your co-workers move around the store at all. You are at risk of getting it. You either need to move back to university and do the 3 hour commute OR self-isolate in a single room and bathroom your parents don’t use— your parents drop meals at your door, you eat in there, leave dishes outside, and you go nowhere else in the house. At all. They do your laundry, and they wash their hands as soon as they are done handling anything you’ve touched. Many medical families that also contain at-risk individuals are having to operate the same way— either move out or self-isolate in a single room 100% of the time while home. Your aren’t quite as at risk as frontline medical workers of catching it, but you are definitely, definitely at risk of giving it to your father, and he is definitely in the category where it will very, very, VERY likely kill him if he catches it. Take that seriously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm pregnant, and there is suspicion that coronavirus could cause complications (but it's mostly an unknown). So we are taking extra-cautious steps. My husband is removing his shirt and slacks and putting them directly in the washer when he gets home-- our washer is right by the garage door. He was already washing his hands as soon as he gets home, but we are both making doubly sure to do that. If he were to be exposed to someone that tested positive, he would stop cooking for me and move into the guest room.

We've also stocked up on non-perishable and easy-to-cook frozen food in case community spread starts up in our area. No need to get more exposure than necessary, but especially with me pregnant, that's a concern. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's \*very\* well-known in legal circles that pre-law is just as useful or useless for law school as every other major. You learn most of what you need to know in law school, and you HAVE to go to law school. In undergrad, people need to spend those years honing their critical thinking and writing skills, and there are many, many majors that do that. It also helps to have exposure to other areas of study-- you never know what knowledge will come in handy in practice. Whereas, if you're just in pre-law, you end up learning LESS than your future colleagues who took an interdisciplinary approach, because you'll just repeat what you're doing in law school.

On top of that, the most lucrative majors you can be in as an undergrad planning on law school are the sciences-- patent law is one of the few areas of law where you are practically guaranteed a job in today's market IF you are qualified for it... by being a science undergrad.

Edit: but you politely asked a fair question that most people outside of legal circles don't think too much about. You shouldn't get downvoted for that. You just got downvoted for the reasoning you were asking for an explanation on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the US, circumcision is often talked about and presented to the public in the same way vaccinations are-- medically necessary. Or at least, medically helpful. A baby can't consent to vaccinations, but most (normal) people would never not vaccinate a baby because of that. It's the same exact thinking when it comes to circumcision. So they honestly think they are doing the right thing by their child. "Circumcisions are medically necessary" is so drilled into people that they are extremely skeptical when you tell them that's not true.

Edit: sorry I wasn’t clear; I’m not saying there are NEVER medical reasons, and I’m definitely not saying I agree that circumcisions are like vaccinations. But many people think about them the same way, unfortunately. </TEXT>

But on the other hand, to take the theory further just for fun, maybe the whole Bond estate was staged for Silva's, or any other potential enemy's, benefit. Like something MI6 had on hand just in case they ever REALLY needed some proof of Bond's existence as a person. Then with the Silva/M situation, M and Bond played along because "never break cover" and Silva so clearly wanted the situation to be personal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of my favorite Bond fan theories (that Skyfall ruined) was that James Bond was a code name and not his actual name. So that's why he can tell people his name, and that's why a different person becomes Bond every few years-- it's just a new person assuming the code name. All of them have somewhat similar traits because they are helpful to the job-- as you said, a shaken martini is a good way to drink alcohol without getting as drunk/detect poison; and in Bond universe being a womanizer is a good way to get information and get important allies, so MI6 purposely recruits men willing to do that.

Sadly, Skyfall shot that theory to hell. I was so mad (despite it being an incredible movie), because this is probably my favorite fan theory of any fandom. It's very simple and explains a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One odd expense that I don't see mentioned regularly: depending on where you land, save up for snow tires, since you'll be one of the few people that has to battle the elements no matter how bad the weather is. They do make a difference in the worst conditions, and they've paid for themselves if they help avoid a single accident.

 Also, unless you match in the area of the country you want to stay in after residency (and especially if you might do a fellowship), budget for interview travel in your 4th year. If you don't already have a credit card that gets you travel points, I'd recommend you get one and put as much as you can on it (and pay it off each month, obviously). The travel points *easily* more than halved our interview expenses-- it probably covered closer to 2/3s of our costs by the end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unless they are very close family or friends (which is more unusual) *and* the new parents have extended an invitation, visiting the hospital right after birth is fairly unusual! Even close family-- like parents' siblings-- often do not go to the hospital, although sometimes they do. A lot of mothers don't want to deal with guests so shortly after giving birth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTB. I doubt anyone will notice if you don't bring a book. Also, in the US you do not need to bring a gift when you visit the baby after it's born. Sometimes people bring food for the new parents, though. That is definitely not mandatory. But if you bring a post-birth gift, the parents will be delighted but surprised.

The only events in the US that have registries are weddings and births (and at that, only first births, or widely spaced births where the parents probably have gotten rid of all their baby stuff. If you get a registry invite to a birthday party, that's tacky AF). But weddings and births are traditionally the events that mark a new start on a more expensive phase of life where people are starting or expanding a family-- houses and babies are expensive! But for baby showers,  registries help the new parents and baby get off to the best start possible, which is the most important thing when babies are involved-- think "it takes a village." This is just a way of executing that mentality.

 New parents don't need 100 lacey white newborn onesies-- they are so cute that that's what most people would buy a baby girl, for example-- before the days of registries, that literally happened to my grandmother when she had my mom (it was only 20 lacey dresses, but still that's WAY too many). New parents desperately need things like you saw on the registry-- car seats, bottles, etc. But they don't need TWO car seats or 25 baby bottles. Hence, the registry, to make sure people don't buy multiples. It's a system of gift-giving that places importance on helping people be financially secure during the most traditionally vulnerable parts of life.  I hope this helps make the registries make a little more sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tell the doctor each and every time. After a bad experience before pregnancy with an IUD, I do not stay with offices that employ disorganized support staff. An IUD almost ruptured my uterus because, while my doctor was on her game, the combination of a slow/disorganized  nurse, insurance biller, and receptionist caused it to go untreated for much longer than it should have. If it were me (and I am not you!), I would tell me doctor that the frequency of errors from her support staff has me extremely concerned that sooner or later, the constant carelessness will lead to a big error that will compromise my safety or that of my baby.

I would also discontinue care with that office after my postpartum 6 week appointment and find a new one. I get that mistakes happen, and I allow for an occasional one, but when they are constant, that is cause for concern when it comes to your health. </TEXT>

<TEXT> These are never done unless the child has a condition that will cause it to eventually die in utero or shortly after birth. The latter cases are sometimes performed when the condition would cause the baby pain that the parents wish to spare it-- my friend's grandchild was born with a condition like that (osteogenesis imperfecta), and the baby was in so much pain during his few hours of life that he couldn't even cry. He was likely in pain after his nervous system developed in utero, too. A couple months after his birth and death, his mother wound up in a psychiatric hospital not just out of grief, but in part because she regretted not getting an abortion, because the only thing her baby ever experienced in its life was pain. Her family's pastor counseled them not to get the abortion. No one in their family goes to that church anymore.

The other situation you might hear about late term abortions is when the mother's life is at risk, except those aren't abortions at all. They are premature deliveries. They deliver the baby early and attempt to save both mother and baby. Sometimes delivery is so early that the baby dies. But it's not abortion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And many residents and fellows have awful health plans. My husband has a good individual plan, but the family plan is $9000 per year in premiums. On a fellow's salary. Some of his colleagues' families have had to go on welfare once they have kids. I don't think people believe that we have doctors' families on WIC in this country. We're pregnant now, and "fortunately," we can put the baby and him on my work's family plan for "only" $5000/year. Plus deductibles. But a lot of other resident/fellow spouses can't work since they are transplants to a new city and can't find jobs that a) offset the cost of childcare; and b) have zero weekends or evening hours, because their physician spouse will also frequently be working at those times and someone has to watch the kids. </TEXT>

You were the one who brought up the running analogy in the first place; I just happen to have a first-hand example of why that analogy is just as thoughtless as the original comment in the post.

And I'm not playing hardship Olympics here-- I very obviously do not have the same hardships as a blind person operating in a sighted society, and I never claimed that I did. I merely pointed out, by using a more obvious example than blood pressure, that you saying that someone with a medical condition different than your own should just suck it up in order to not be a little bitch was not very kind. Neither one of us get to be the representatives speaking for the entire disabled community; I'm certainly not claiming to. I'm simply stating a point of view that I do know exists among many people who are in that community and/or love people who are in it. You are free to disagree with my point of view. </TEXT>

I also don't feel like I'm asking the world to focus on me or my family or treat us like victims. It's just... hey, maybe try to make a small change that could make it easier for other people to be happy if A LOT of people make that same small change. Those comments don't make it impossible to be happy with a disability, but they just throw up a needless obstacle. Why do that to people if you don't have to? (and I'm honestly mostly talking about my family members who have pretty serious disabilities. It is only in response to your comment that I realized that my blood pressure could be considered a disability in some contexts... it's not really going to change anything for me).

And you saying "you should instead focus on yourself and see if you can finally get that mile down" is pretty much the same thing as telling a blind person to focus on themselves so that maybe they can finally get that Where's Waldo down. Like... I physically can't and should not try, according to a cardiologist. I just haven't really thought of it as a disability before since it's never never come up. But your comment sort of implies that you may not have the kindest outlook on people who have disabilities that are different to your own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's great that you are able to not psychologically affected by comments like these, but not everyone can or should have to go through life ignoring comments like these. I know a couple of people in my family with disabilities (the same genetic condition) that have tried but can't help but feel worse for having heard them. They are very good at ignoring comments like this in the moment, but those constant tiny-stabbing comments and being so overlooked by society gets to them over time. It builds. I don't blame them for it, because they try so, so hard. It isn't just ignoring this ONE comment. It's this comment and other comments and situations that happen day in and day out every single day. Asking that people be better and be more aware of how they talk about disabilities is not saying they should view people with disabilities as victims. It's just saying, hey, please make the mental space in your mind for people that live a different life than you do, because it takes little individual effort to make a huge difference in their lives over time.

And not that you explicitly asked, my excuse for not running a mile is a disability of sorts, I suppose, although I've never thought of it as one since running rarely comes up for me. I have a blood pressure issue that prevents me from doing moderate-high impact cardio for very long without passing out. I guess I'd be first out in the zombie apocalypse. But I don't feel the need to categorize everyone else whose disabilities and life circumstances I don't know as little bitches just because they can't run a mile. It just doesn't feel like a nice way to go through life. </TEXT>

A better analogy would be if someone saw an ad for a wheelchair or crutches and said "If you can't handle walking on your own, you should not be going anywhere." Most people would see that as offensive simply because wheelchairs are known by almost everyone to be assistive devices. This guy (presumably) didn't know the egg thing was meant to be an assistive device and made an ignorant comment. Hopefully he learns and does better next time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't have kids until you're ready. From your comments, it sounds like your parents want you to focus on school and job so that you are financially secure when they die. As much as you think they want grandchildren before they die, do you think they would really want you to prioritize that over your own financial and emotional stability? From what you've said, I'm guessing the answer is no.

If you take that pregnancy test later and it's positive, do what makes sense for you, not what makes sense for your parents, who are not the people that would be pregnant, raising, and supporting a child while attempting to finish school, get a job, and then be a working parent. Some people choose to undertake a challenge like that when faced with an unexpected positive, and some don't. But don't make that choice based off of what you *think* other people might want. </TEXT>

I liked the idea of my husband and I having the same last name as a cohesive family unit. But at the end of the day, my name just felt like mine. I like my name as it is, and it felt like a part of me. Maybe I will still change my name in the future as we have kids, but for right now, I'm happy with my name the way it is.

Not changing my name doesn't mean I love my or respect husband any less. For those people saying it's a symbol of respect and love, does that mean your husband wouldn't respect and love YOU since he didn't change his last name? No; no one says that simply because men aren't expected to even consider it. If men are capable of love and respect while keeping their names, so are women. </TEXT>

Like... we live in the 21st century in the age of the internet and the ADA. While people do sometimes have a background such that they forget the disabled exist, it's easy enough to start training yourself to stop doing that.
And maybe people don't know how to crack an egg, or maybe they just hate doing it. Maybe they just aren't good at it for whatever reason and decided they'd rather not risk spending time fishing egg shell out of the dish. If someone has that preference, it doesn't really affect me, and it also doesn't bar them from cooking if they have other basics down.

Why say that they shouldn't be cooking and imply they are idiots? Why not just say, "Why would people need this?" or "I don't understand why anyone would want to use this."
Invite an explanation instead of trying to insult people right out of the gate.

And it's not necessary to know every single disability to know that some people have problems with their hands and wrists. Like, you don't need to know every possible reason someone might need a wheelchair. You just need to know that there are medical conditions that require one. </TEXT>

Disabled people hear-- implied and otherwise-- that they don't belong in "normal" society because they are too stupid, too limited, too dependent, too broken, too MUCH, etc. If one person says it, sure, they can brush it off. But it is death by a thousand cuts.

<TEXT> We are prioritizing savings over loans and only pay the minimum due. During residency/fellowship, for us, the biggest consideration in that decision was the possibility of Public Service Loan Forgiveness. During residency and the first year of fellowship, my husband wasn't 100% sure that he'd end up in a public institution after training, but there was a good chance he would. So it was worth just paying the minimum and seeing what post-residency brought us, because there was a good chance it would result in forgiveness of the entire loan. The extra interest we are building up is well worth that risk, especially now that we know his post-fellowship job will definitely be in a qualifying hospital.

Most residencies are in qualifying entities, so there's a *very* high chance your partner will have 3+ of the 10 years of payments done by the end of residency. And if you does a fellowship after that, that's even more years. Since your partner wants to be an ER doc, there's a pretty good chance his post-residency job will be in a qualifying institution. The PSLF program should factor heavily in your financial planning. </TEXT>

Zoning out for a little bit is NOT a waste of time and is in fact necessary for his mental health. Your brain is on pretty much all day dealing with much more high-stakes decisions than the general population. You HAVE to unwind and turn your brain off sometimes.
2. If you're aiming for a surgical residency, video games are actually helpful. They help with hand-eye coordination, and given how many surgical procedures are done with video screens/controls, video game skills are almost directly applicable now. I don't know of any studies, but in my husband's field, it's informally known that people who play (or played) video games start out with a noticeable edge in doing procedures when they first start out. One of my husband's attendings told him he could pick out which of the new fellows played video games and which didn't.
3. If your husband is on reddit, you might suggest he join r/PartnersInMedicine. It's for the partners of med students and physicians, and he can vent or bounce his concerns off of people who can relate (and tell him that what you're doing is normal and that he needs to pick up more of the housework) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just found out I was pregnant. I will be 5 weeks tomorrow, and this is my first pregnancy. I called my OBGYN's office, and they set me up with my first 3 appointments. I'm meeting with an NP for the first two, and my 8 week appointment isn't happening until week 9-- I can live with that timing, I guess. Week 10 is also with the NP and is happening on time.

Then week 12 isn't happening until 1 day shy of week 15. They couldn't get me in 12 or 13, and I'm out of town all of 14. That appointment is with my OB.

Is it normal for an OB to not be able to see you for 2 solid weeks for a prenatal appointment? And to not meet with your OB at all until week 12 (or 15 in my case). And it sounds like my doctor/her practice is going to give me zero information on "how to be pregnant" until week 9 of my pregnancy. Is all of this this normal?

Edit: Thank you all for the advice and information! Fortunately, so many of my friends have recently had babies that I feel like I know most of the "how to be pregnant" stuff. I was just worried about whether not getting it from the doctor/NP was a sign of inattentiveness-- I had a *very* bad experience with a previous doctor/NP team where their office's bizarre and inattentive methods almost led to an IUD rupturing my uterus. I'm glad to hear that I didn't jump into another situation like that. I feel much, much better. Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Him being a doctor changes things. His license will be flagged, but **assuming that he cuts this crap out and shows he's taking steps to prevent future alcohol-related problems** (and there's nothing previous), he will likely be able to get another job in the future. And there's a slightly-higher-than-average possibility he \*might\* (very, very heavy emphasis on the "might") keep the one he has, although that's pretty unlikely. But he'll work again, likely under monitoring. There's just too much of a doctor shortage. His work and/or the state licensing board will likely check in with him regularly to make sure he's staying sober. He will have to demonstrate sobriety-- via AA/another treatment program, and it wouldn't be a bad idea for him to proactively get CDT blood tests (it tests for alcohol use over the course of several weeks/months).\]

I'm in a Facebook group for doctor's spouses, and there have a been a few posts like yours over the years.

Edit: obviously, this only has bearing on his job prospects-- which will still be difficult-- but your relationship is another matter. You don't have to offer him this information now if you don't feel like it-- you get to be mad and not feel like comforting him for a while. But he should for sure get into an alcohol treatment program as soon as humanly possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You get to be angry about this. You get to have this line in the sand. But you're allowed to take time to decide what *you* want to do here. You can't tell him it will be okay right now, and he just has to live with that. Maybe you'll decide to forgive him; maybe you won't. You don't have a responsibility to society to withhold your love from the relationship to punish him. At the same time, you don't owe him your love as a consolation prize. It is yours to decide what to do with. Talk to a lawyer to see what your options are. A counselor, if you would like. You should consider going to Al-Anon, a support group for friends/family of alcoholics. It could definitely help you to be around with other people facing similar decisions you are.

Your husband needs to start looking for AA or other alcohol treatment programs ASAP. He needs to never drink again. Showing he is taking sincere steps to prevent this from happening again is the best shot he has at *possibly maybe shot-in-hell* keeping his job. He is most likely 100% screwed there, but alcohol treatment is still something he should do. If he can do that, it may also help you make a decision as to his future. But even if he does all that, you don't owe him the erasure your line in the sand. At the same time, you're allowed to revise where your line in the sand ***if*** ***you feel like that's what you want to do.*** </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't used to track, because my PMS was bad and long enough that my period never caught me by surprise, and I wasn't trying for kids. And I know my sister doesn't track because she's extremely irregular and never wants kids. But my friend is actively trying for a baby and has been for 6 months total now. I have no idea how she can stay sane and *not* track. She sadly lost the pregnancy a couple weeks ago, and a couple days ago she said to me, "So, like, how do I track? Do I just put my period in a calendar or something?" I said that would be a place to start, and she was like, "Nah, I don't want to have to be reminded that it's coming up. Pass." I would love to have whatever level of anxiety she has. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a friend who is also actively trying. She found out she was pregnant last month. I see her every day at work, and she was SO exhausted and having SO much heartburn and nausea, I finally asked her, "Do you think you could be pregnant?" Her: "No, it's just heartburn." Me: "I have never seen you like this, ever, except for the last time you were pregnant. When did you last have a period?" Her: "I don't know. A while ago?"

She went home, took a test, and sure enough, she was pregnant. Several weeks along, as it turned out. And I'm sitting here like, how are you not over-interpreting every single symptom you have like I do? She is patient in precisely no other aspect of her life. How is she so patient and... sane about this?! </TEXT>

And if employers operated fairly, his retaliation claim would also be straightforward. But this one is already not operating fairly. And if this supervisor's behavior so far is anything to go off of, I bet she will try to claim that he is being fired for a reason like you described-- being at fault for the injury, not completing deliveries while on a probation period, not following protocol after injury, etc. (just speculating on possible excuses offered). It's entirely possible LAOP's attorney can still prevail, but this supervisor likely won't make it easy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1) Start tracking now. Use the wiki to learn about temping and test strips.

2) Make sure your pre-natal has DHA in it. I was super annoyed to find out my pre-natal didn't. I assumed a pre-natal would have everything you're supposed to take, but A LOT do not include DHA.

3) Read Expecting Better by Emily Oster. She has a chapter on TTC that helps you realize that under just-starting-out TTC circumstances, you don't actually have to change your life all that drastically if you don't want to. She's a health economist who dives deep into the medical basis for all the recommendations made to TTC/pregnant women-- she looks at all the studies for how well they were done, what they \*actually\* conclude, etc. That chapter made me feel a lot more sane about the two week wait.

4) Decide ahead of time whether you will want to buy the (expensive) First Response/Clear Blue tests that let you test for pregnancy starting 5/6 days before your period. I wish I'd looked into it ahead of time to help myself save $ and a little sanity. I bought some Clear Blue spur of the moment, but then I discovered those tests are only 51% accurate (they get increasingly accurate as you get toward your period, but you only get to 99% on the day of your missed period). [https://www.clearblue.com/healthcare-professionals/pregnancy-tests/digital](https://www.clearblue.com/healthcare-professionals/pregnancy-tests/digital) But these tests are helpful for some people emotionally; think about if you're one of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The timing is definitely helpful, and I agree, you don't need writing to prevail. But the employer, and particularly this supervisor, who sounds vicious, could come up with a coincidental reason LAOP got fired over this that isn't the workers comp-- hopefully that reason doesn't sound plausible, but that's not a given. LAOP could challenge that reason and still prevail, but the lack of a record will make that harder than it would have been. All I'm saying is that it's a concern. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a different issue with the same emotional results-- PMDD. I get *severe* mood swings and anxiety/depression during my PMS week, in addition to exacerbated physical PMS symptoms. Unfortunately, the usual treatments for PMDD (anti-depressants and/or oral contraceptives) aren't options for me for other medical reasons. A strategy I developed with my therapist to handle the PMDD mood swings:

1) I put a reminder in my calendar that indicates when my PMS week is starting, and have it on my calendar each day until my period is supposed to show up. It helps me remember that my mood swings are happening for a reason when I'm having them. Being aware of them in the moment isn't a 100% cure, but it's definitely helpful in helping myself calm down, both for my husband's sake and mine.

2) I give a head's up to my husband that PMDD is starting when the calendar notice pops up.

3) I gave my husband permission to gently say, "hey, do you think this is the PMDD?" which is something men are taught (rightly) that they should usually never say to women. But in my case, due to the PMDD, 95% of the time during that week, he's right (either I'm freaking out over nothing or overreacting to something small). Sometimes I cry more when he says that, and he'll ask if I want a hug or if I want to go curl up in bed while he makes me tea. If there is something that's actually a problem between us, I angrily tell him "this isn't over" and then force myself to give it a few hours. He gives me a lot of alone time, but he checks in on me in case I also need some support.

4) I'm pretty good at dealing with it at work (it gets pent up and released at home, unfortunately for my husband). But I give myself permission to shut my door and take more breaks (like a total of 15-20 min extra per day), particularly after dealing with frustrating or draining situations. I make up the time later in the day at home and/or the next week. Sadly, with the state of working culture in the US, that's not possible with a lot of jobs. But if you can give yourself a little breathing room at work, do it.

I know it's not the same root problem, but maybe the above strategies could be adapted for the fertility drugs. I'm also working on long-term strategy to manage the PMDD with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which has helped it over time. But I'm not sure a long-term strategy is worth it for (relatively) short-term medication cycles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Given your previous diagnosis (congrats on the recovery, btw!!), you may want to run this routine by your dermatologist-- particularly the acids. My mom had some pre-cancerous spots removed, and her doctor wanted her to get rid of a few "normal" skin products afterward that I wouldn't have thought twice about for myself. But my mom was much older than you are/different issue, so your doctor might not be concerned. </TEXT>

 Also, as to your parents--definitely keep your therapist updated on your relationship with them. The last thing you need is your mother trying to convince you that maybe your brother has a point or that somehow the rupture in your relationship with them is due to your own flaws. </TEXT>

That is not the daughter's fault, but that does mean this wedding should not be happening.

<TEXT> He's failing her in that he's essentially saying that her grief is more important than anything or anyone else, with no boundaries whatsoever. While she should be allowed a great deal of latitude and support, this is a line that should be drawn. He's failing her in that encouraging her to deal with her grief in a way that hurts someone else in very real way. And I don't think it's necessarily *meant* to come off as negative. I honestly don't think the step-daughter means it to be that way. I think she's just a normal teenager who doesn't understand the impact her words and actions may have on someone else, and one who (not unusually) does not truly understand what weddings are truly about-- they are about a new beginning, and a SEVEN minute eulogy doesn't belong in a wedding. Seven minutes is a long speech in a day filled with speeches (our wedding coordinator recommended all toasts be under 3, and she was 100% correct).

The wedding is not just about OP, but it isn't just about the step-daughter, either. It's in fact much less about the step-daughter than OP, although it is about her somewhat. She isn't throwing a fit over someone hijacking the karaoke for a few sad songs at her birthday party. She's upset that someone is giving a eulogy that focuses on her new husband's previous marriage in a way that paints a bad comparison AT HER WEDDING. OP's feelings matter a lot here, and her interpretation is one that other guests-- not all of them, but enough-- will also draw, as demonstrated by the other people on this sub who saw it. She is very much willing to come to a reasonable compromise (a shorter dedication), but her fiance does not care about his new wife's feelings on an important matter at all. Children, even grieving ones, should not be allowed to run over other people just because it is what they want (even if they are well-intentioned). They need to learn that even in the face of grief, other people's feelings still matter. That is how he is failing his daughter. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But the context with the rest of the speech matters. This isn't an off-the-cuff "hopefully you do well on your exam!" This is like a parent spending several minutes saying, "Your brother did SO well on that test. Everyone said he was the smartest, most wonderful student ever. So brilliant. He really was just the perfect intellectual." And then they go on for seven more minutes in that vein. "So incredible! Absolutely perfect!" and then they look at you, who has never, ever taken an exam before, much less that exact exam, and who has already gotten the feeling that your parents and their friends don't think you're as good as your brother, and ending with, "So, yeah, hopefully you do as well as he did." And they tell you that in front of all of your classmates and family on a microphone at your own graduation party.

It sounded like this thing about the house happened relatively recently. And no where does it say that she didn't ask. For all we know, she did, or her fiance just straight up told her that his daughter would be okay-- I can't imagine they've managed to get this far without having a single conversation about her (but, dumber things have happened, I admit). But I agree that now that she knows, she needs to take responsibility. But given that this stuff has happened just recently, I can't blame her for not knowing her step-daughter better than her step-daughter's own father. I honestly believe he carries most of the blame for all this. He is failing both his daughter and his fiance, and it sounds like he's been handling it poorly for a while-- he should have slowed this relationship down a while ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People can privately believe and gossip about it all they want (hey, we all secretly love a dramatic wedding when we aren't too close to the couple), but no one should ever imply that in a speech or in front of the couple at the actual wedding.

The dad knew that OP obviously didn't have children and no experience parenting them. She obviously had no experience with childhood grief. OP knew the daughter would be upset, but people can be sad but still be okay with life going on. And if her dad thinks she's ready, and if her therapist is helping her through it, why should OP question that until confronted with a situation like this or the house decorating? She's still getting to know her step-daughter, and before any issues came up in front of her, it would have been weird for her to tell the child's actual parent, "Hey, I know you have parented her for 15 years and I just met her last year and have no experience with teenagers, and but don't think your daughter is ready for us to get engaged, even though you, the person with 100% of the applicable real-world experience, say otherwise." Now that OP is aware of the problem, I think she should postpone the wedding. But it wasn't on her before situations like this started coming up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> >No one knows the future, OP and the fiancé  have only been together a  max of what? A year and a half maybe? So yea hopefully is the  appropriate word.

You just perfectly stated the same implication I and many other commenters see that phrase. That is an ***awful*** sentiment to say or imply at someone's wedding. Beyond awful. It is the absolute height of rudeness and cruelty at a wedding to say that the marriage might not work out, no matter how long they've been together. OP can be compassionate toward the daughter but still not want to be told at her own wedding that it might not work out. That is an entirely reasonable and appropriate boundary to draw.

And a year-and-a-half is plenty of time for many people (including widows and widowers) to get engaged and have happy and successful marriages, especially when they are a little older-- 30 count as a little older for this. The issue here is that it wasn't enough time when you take the daughter's grief into account. The fact is that they probably *shouldn't* be getting married so quickly for her sake, but the dad made the decision to go ahead with it. OP is probably just now figuring out that he made a bad decision. But she shouldn't be expected to know the depth of his child's grief and how to handle it better than the child's actual parent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we definitely agree on all of that. I just think that she shouldn't be expected to know all of that, especially when all the trusted adults in her life are telling her to do the exact opposite. Heck, most teenagers don't have a 100% solid understanding of what weddings truly symbolize-- my 16 yo SIL was a little lost at our wedding. They (and a lot of adults) think it means "happily ever after" and not "a new start." I think she's just acting like a very normal grieving teenager, and the adults in her life are not guiding her well.

Honestly, I think the blame here falls on her dad. It was his job to explain why her speech/7 minute memorial aren't appropriate and to help her write something that acknowledges her mother in an appropriate (and brief) way. He's failing his new wife by not doing that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh, I agree it's too much for her to process. I think her dad is the one in the wrong here. It was his job to slow down the relationship for the sake of his daughter, and he didn't. OP is probably just now realizing that this was too fast for him and his daughter.  Her fiance's child will always be his *first* priority, but she should not be his *only* priority when he gets remarried. Even in non-step, non-widower situations, spouses should prioritize one another. Not over their children, but in addition to them. Right now, it seems like he cannot prioritize OP in an appropriate way (understandably, given the timeline), so isn't fair to his daughter or OP that he is getting remarried now.

Seven straight minutes talking exclusively about a previous wife and her dad's first marriage is not appropriate at his second wedding. It is especially inappropriate to hold up his first marriage as utterly perfect and then end with a line that literally says *hopefully* OP can live up to it. And if OP started off with that attitude toward his first wife, yeah that is asshole behavior. But given the fact that she's being forced to live in a shrine to her and being told she must listen to that awful speech at her own wedding, I don't blame her for being resentful right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because this is a pretty nuanced situation, and grief does crazy things to a person's ability to think straight. The fact that so many people, many being adults not currently grieving, on AITA and this sub are saying that it's perfectly okay shows how nuanced it is. I have to imagine it's even harder when it's your mother who you still had a parent-*child* relationship with when she died. And Greta Thunberg is considered exceptional for a reason (and is also not dealing with a deeply personal grief), and her parents seem like they are giving good guidance. Not everyone can be exceptional, especially in the face of bad advice from the person you are supposed to trust most in the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My interpretation is based off of the basic facts about the speech: it is two minutes about how incredible her parents marriage was, and that OP is only mentioned in the context of the last line that she directly quotes. That line is pretty bad in the context of speech that is solely celebratory of the groom's first marriage. I would feel pretty bad for the bride if I heard any speech that followed that basic outline. I don't think everyone would have that reaction, but I also don't think it's an unreasonable interpretation being pulled out of thin air.

And I have been to a wedding where a widower got remarried after 3 years, and his (adult) son acknowledged his mother in his toast. But it was short and was along the lines of "I got to see my dad in love for 20 years, and he looks like that when he sees you. Thank you for making him happy again" (it was more eloquent than that). It wasn't 7 straight minutes dedicated to how perfect his dad's previous marriage that didn't mention his new marriage at all followed with something easily interpreted as "hopefully you are as good as she was." </TEXT>

But the situations are pretty different, and I don't think Yoffee would be okay with things as they stand in OP's post. No where in that story did Yoffee say that someone, much less a grieving child, essentially gave a eulogy that basically ended with "and hopefully you're as good as her" at their wedding. The thing about OP not being able to redecorate any of the house in any way is almost certainly something Yoffee would have said was not okay in her advice column. If it were in line with her usual advice, she'd probably recommend couples counseling (and maybe individual for the husband) and possibly postponing the wedding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, but the implication is there, and you don't have to look very hard to find it in the way the speech is structured now-- a lot of people here are seeing that too, so she's not just pulling the interpretation out of thin air. The speech *could* be tweaked to still talk about how great her parents' relationship was *and* come off as much less passive aggressive. I don't expect a 15 year old to understand those nuances in her grief, but her father should.

And the fact is that OP's feelings *do* matter here. This isn't a matter of her saying "I feel like I hate tattoos, so I want my step-daughter to cover hers," or "If feel like I hate the centerpieces."This is a matter of her saying, "I feel like my step-daughter is about to heavily imply to a room full of people and me at my own wedding that I will never be as good a wife to her dad as her mother was." That is not small potatoes. No one should have to feel like that at her own wedding, and the fact that her fiance is okay with letting that happen indicates that he's may not be ready to get re-married. His child will always be his first priority. But when he take on a new wife, her child is no longer his *only* priority. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The issue isn't that her daughter is mentioning how great her parents' marriage was. It's that she is going on about it, *and only it*, for two full minutes. If she talked about it like, "I saw how kind my parents were to each other, and I see that in you, too," that would make sense. But that's not what's happening. The way she has structured and ended the speech comes off as her saying that OP's marriage will just never be as good... which is a shitty thing to imply at a wedding, no matter who you are.

And, no, this wedding is not just about OP, but it *is* about her in part. No one should have to sit through a speech at their own wedding that even subtly (if unintentionally) casts them as an evil step-mother... or at least a step-mother who will just never be as good as the first wife. If her fiance doesn't feel like his daughter is in a place where he can gently explain to her why this speech is inappropriate as written (and she may not be, which is reasonable), he should not be getting married right now. This whole thing sounds like it's happening way too soon for the daughter's mental health. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, I got the tone of the speech just from the short quote OP gave. If the rest of the speech is only about how great her parent's marriage was, and that's the only sentence that mentions OP, it will come across to a lot of people the way I mentioned above, even if the daughter doesn't mean it maliciously. And while I'm sure the therapist encouraged a dedication of some sort, I can't believe that she recommended the content of the speech to be what it is.

And, for something this big (meaning the speech *with this content* at her wedding, not just it being her wedding), OP should not have to suck it up. She shouldn't have to get even subtly slated (even if unintentionally) as the evil stepmother who will probably never be good enough at her own wedding. If the fiance doesn't think his daughter is ready to hear why this kind of speech is inappropriate (and she may not be), they shouldn't get married. </TEXT>

It won't outshine the whole wedding, but it will be talked about, and most women would be incredibly uncomfortable, if not humiliated, by that-- OP's insecurity here isn't unreasonable. And, while this isn't fair to OP, most importantly, this is also not a kind thing to do to his daughter long-term. Encouraging his daughter to compare her mother and her new step-mother in a way that's impossible to live up to is unhealthy for her. Encouraging her to do this two seconds after his symbolic union to her step-mother just emphasizes that he's okay with that comparison. </TEXT>

The issue here isn't that she's talking about her mother. The issue is how she's doing it. And again, just want to be clear that I do not blame her for this.

But recommending that she give a speech at the wedding where the (pretty obvious) undertone is "She was perfect for my dad, and I'm not so sure you are. Good luck" is basically *encouraging* OP's daughter to constantly compare OP to her mother, which is an awful thing to do to both OP, and more importantly, the daughter.

The dad is kind of the asshole here, because 1) it sounds like now is not the time to be bringing a step-mother into his child's life; and 2) if it WERE the right time, he needs to understand that while his first wife can and should always be a presence in his family's life, he needs to make room for his second wife to be his wife without constant comparisons to his first one. Having a speech two seconds after his second wedding that is pretty explicitly a comparison is a cruel thing to do to OP. </TEXT>

Like, I wasn't her favorite person in the world and she was obviously extremely upset, but she felt better off knowing. In retrospect,  I think the guilt would have hung over me for the rest of my life if I had let her go ahead and marry him without saying something. She was such a kind person that she took a beat to be concerned about me, which still blows my mind. She really was **way** too good for him, and I'm so glad I gave her the information she needed to end that relationship before she got in even deeper.

Edit: after reading u/lotterynote's comment, I feel I should point out that I feel like I got the best possible reaction. I was anticipating something much worse, including her not believing me. The conversation was *incredibly* stressful and uncomfortable for both of us, despite how relatively well it went. Just be ready for that, and take care of yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I'd have a tough time choosing wither to put program A or C higher. I'd put B at #4. The low COL in the Midwest is pretty attractive with loans and needing to catch up on retirement savings. But it sounds like you might be able to manage that in the Northeast, too. You may have an easier time keeping the commute down in the Midwest while still getting a place with a yard, too. We live in the Midwest and have a house with a yard that's about 15 minutes from the hospital. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since you don't have kids yet/are open to moving away from family, I would go with something lower COL than the Bay Area. That way you can save up and even dump money into retirement. If you decide that you want to be near family after residency for whatever reason, you'll have the opportunity to move to the Bay Area *and* have a nice little nest egg saved up to get you started there or anywhere else you might want to move.

One other thing to consider: were those other programs serious about wanting him to start the research there? Logistically and financially, how much support would they be willing to provide to a "lowly" resident starting research that's never been done there before? Some programs might be really into it, some might not. And while Program C is already doing the research, will there actually be opportunities there for him to participate, or are there already too many people doing it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally get this. My husband had a major health scare last year (a sudden onset hand tremor and brain fog lasting for days). He kept dismissing the symptoms as "not a big deal" until I got a friend of ours who is a neurologist on the phone, who pointed out it could, in fact, be a VERY big deal and required immediate testing. I drove him to the ER, and he kept giving the ER physician incorrect information or glossing over it-- like, "have you been sick in the past few weeks?" and my husband said no... we'd both had a virus not two weeks before. This turned out to be VERY relevant since it was likely an unusual post-viral reaction.

After that ridiculous ER appointment, he had a follow-up with a neurologist a couple days later. I'm glad I took off work to go with my husband, because he again kept leaving out things that I had to correct him on. The neurologist knew exactly why I was there and seemed glad I was, because the information I gave did change the possible diagnoses. If he has anything major come up again, I'm going with him. When I was trying to convince him to get checked out, I straight up told him I didn't trust his medical judgment when it came to his own health. After that whole situation, I get to win that argument forever. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had almost this EXACT same problem as an undergrad,-- except my advisor told me that a class would count for a requirement, and then a year later, the department head tried saying, "No, that didn't count," when I was one semester away from graduating. Here's how it went for me, in case it helps: I tried reasoning with the department head on my own-- I sent all the emails between me and the professor-- written proof I had permission. Department head wouldn't budge and kept telling me, "Well we can't graduate someone that doesn't meet graduation requirements, and this didn't, even if you were told it did."

After weeks of trying to get them to listen to 21-year-old me, I finally looped my mom into what was happening. She called the department head ONCE with no new information, but suddenly they were able to make "an exception." Once a "real adult" (from her view) was involved, I think the department head realized that I could turn this into a real problem for her and just didn't want to deal with it. She just wasn't willing to take a young person seriously. I didn't love the impression of me going "crying to mommy," but my pride could take it if it meant I could graduate on time. And I did really, really try on my own before bringing my mom into it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The book Expecting Better has a lot of information on this. She is a health economist and looked at all of the medical studies that have been done and concluded you would have to have a ***crazy*** amount of alcohol during the luteal phase to do anything to a developing embryo, and even once it implants, pretty much all studies have shown that moderate amounts of alcohol will not make a difference in outcomes. Where that line is is debatable-- according to many studies, one or two glasses *per day* are fine (shocking, right?), and according to more limited studies, five per day is definitely *not* fine-- obviously, there haven't been many studies done on pregnant women consuming huge amounts of alcohol. But there have been lots of studies done on small amounts, and the consensus is that small amounts during implantation and pregnancy has no affect on outcomes. I highly, highly recommend that book. </TEXT>

Some bosses will be nice and let you stick around. Some may wish they could do that, but can't for reasons outside of their control (either upper management or economic).

There's so much time between Match Day and when people have to move for their new locations. There's no reason to throw a wrench in the works sooner than necessary-- especially if there is ANY chance you might end up staying-- I almost certainly would have lost a promotion I got shortly after Match had I given them a notice like "hey I'm most likely leaving, but there's a chance I'll stay.

<TEXT> I did not tell my employer.  My mom is a high-level HR consultant who talked me through this. She would never advise anyone to give notice more than AT MOST 8 weeks out for really niche jobs, unless it's really, really, really niche. Usually 2-4 is what she recommends, depending on the amount of training/transition required. No matter how much I trusted my manager, my health insurance and continued salary until I absolutely had to leave were way too important to risk. Even if my manager didn't have a problem keeping me on until my move date, the decision could be one that higher-ups take out of her hands.

I decided if we had to move, I would give 4 weeks notice to give time to transition. Against very slim odds, we ended up staying in our home city, so I'm glad I didn't say anything.Edit: The above changes if you think your organization might move you to another office or give you remote work at your request.

<TEXT> My understanding was that you can get pregnant while breastfeeding without getting a period in that you could get pregnant the first time you ovulate postpartum, so you'll never get a period. But outside of that, I don't think it's possible to ovulate and not get a period. If you ovulate, you will get a period (but not necessarily vice versa) unless you get pregnant. So, you could use test strips or temp in an effort to catch that very first ovulation cycle. But as far as tracking some sort of regular cycle that might be happening, my understanding is that there's nothing to really track until your cycle starts again. This info is from a couple of friends who were commiserating about this, so take with a grain of salt. </TEXT>

<TEXT> \#notadoctor, but based on your information and comments...this sounds off, and I'd be questioning whether the doctor is pumping you for money. Either that or medical standards where you are are very different (I am in the US, for context). You're only 33, so it seems weird that she didn't let you try for 6 months, which is the minimum my 5 friends and I have been told. Some of us were told 1 year.

It's particularly odd since you've shown you CAN get pregnant naturally after only 1 cycle! I'm really sorry for your loss, btw... I don't want what I'm about to say seem too harsh... CPs are sadly extremely common and they often happen for seemingly no reason. For context, of 5 close friends and I (so 6 of us), 4 of us had confirmed chemical pregnancies and 2 of them also had late-ish 1st trimester miscarriages (9 and 11 weeks). My fifth friend never miscarried at all, to her knowledge, and no trouble conceiving naturally. The sixth friend had no miscarriages bud did have unexplained infertility for 2.5 years. She started clomid after 1 year of trying around age 30 or 31. None of the rest of us (all but 1 of whom lost a pregnancy early on) were put on clomid or any of the other stuff you're taking. No extra procedures like a tv ultrasound. Every one of my friends now has had at least 1 successful pregnancy (I just started really trying for the 1st time in December; had a CP in October while on BC-- that's when I learned all about many of my friends' experiences).

I'd get a second opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like the premise a lot. It sounds pretty cool.

I think having good sound effects will go a long way toward making it seem real. Also something "objective" observing the events-- maybe doppler picking up the weird whale, a weather recording device (do boats have those?) recording the bizarre weather, etc. I think having some question as to whether the guy is hallucinating but still having a little objective confirmation could be kind of cool as a layer to the narrative -- think the end of the movie Contact, where it's like 95% probable the main character didn't just dream up what happened, but there's still 5% doubt.

Another thing to make it seem real is to make sure the woman is not *too* ethereal or magic pixie dream girl. Make sure she has some character flaws, and (if romance will be part of the plot-- doesn't have to be) doesn't jump straight to wanting to sleep with the male protagonist before getting to know him a little. That way, she will seem more real and less like a fantasy the guy is having. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To me, using the word "female" as a noun is just an effort to make women sound like a separate species that is just SO beyond understanding by the more rational male mind, so why bother trying? If a person doesn't use "male" in place of  the noun "man," then they are almost certainly are using it in the above sense rather than a medical/law enforcement one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So hypothetically, let's say that your SIL, somehow, truly didn't understand that the question was offensive. Even in that case, your wife's response was STILL inappropriate, because it didn't acknowledge how it affected you. She was only thinking about her poor, poor sister, who didn't MEAN to be racist. She should have been concerned about how it made you feel, not just what her sister intended. But hypothetical aside, given that her sister is an adult, I doubt that her intention was 100% benign.

It's really concerning that your wife has dragged in her whole family to gang up on you on this. It would be concerning to do that in almost any type of disagreement between a married couple, but, regardless of the racist content, the fact that she brought them in to tell you that you're wrong to have feelings about a comment about YOU  is extra problematic. The racist content of the comment adds another layer of concern on top of that. You might consider marriage counseling to talk about how your wife manages disagreements with you-- there are counselors that have experience in interracial couples therapy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your therapist's implication that one has to feel acutely threatened to feel abused is false. Sexual coercion-- without violence-- is a thing. In adults, they don't threaten you with violence, but, simplistically stated, they say or imply "I won't love you if you say no" or some variation on that. Yes, there is an issue with the victim being bad at drawing boundaries and having insecurities with not wanting to disappoint people, but the abuser takes advantage of that (sexual coercion is not simply a case of miscommunication; it is deliberate in targeting and taking advantage of someone vulerable). You know who often is bad at drawing boundaries and hates disappointing older people? You know who is usually really afraid of losing their friends? Kids.

That being said, it's debatable as to whether your friend was old enough to imply any of the above deliberately in the way an adult would-- rather, he could have known he was manipulating you, but he wasn't old enough to understand the gravity of what he was manipulating you into. It really depends on how old he was. But whether he was old enough or not to know the entirety of what he was doing doesn't change the fact of how it affected you. Get a new therapist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll be honest-- waiting for Match Day was easily the most stressed I've been since we started dating up through present day (since then, we've gotten married, combined finances/loans, bought a house, started trying for kids, etc). When we got his match, it was the ideal location, but I still broke down in tears on and off for a day or two out of sheer emotional exhaustion. I think moving is hard for all medspouses, but I think it's especially hard when you're leaving your hometown and lifelong support system (family, friends) for their dream and job. Good luck and make sure you take care of yourself when it comes to the stress of match, and not just him. I made that mistake, thinking that it was so much more stressful for him since it's HIS job and HIS match. But in reality, I was putting just as much, if not more, on the line. You have an equal "right" to be stressed about it, so to speak. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My husband and I had been together for 10 months and living together for 1 when he started applying for fellowships in his specialty-- that being said, we were older (29) and got pretty serious pretty quickly. During the conversations about whether I would move with him, we got engaged. Just to give you an idea of what our relationship was like when I gave input on the application/rank process

His specialty was *very* competitive, and we both agreed the best course of action would be for him to apply to everywhere he felt like he would have a good chance of getting an interview for, regardless of location. I was not a huge fan of some locations, and I let him know that, but I trusted that he felt that applying there was necessary to increase his chances of getting in somewhere. At the point of him picking places to apply, I didn't push *against* any places, but I did ask that he make sure to apply to our hometown program, since that's where I really wanted to be.

Then the rank list came back and he got interview invitations. He went on all interviews and ranked all of them, because it is insane not to, no matter how bad the location. However, I got to have serious input on the rank list. I desperately did not want to live in Chicago city proper, and one of the invitations was for a downtown hospital there. He ranked that last, even though the program was decent. He said he was fine doing that because while the program was good, it wasn't better enough than other places to justify the emotional cost of living there. I also asked him that if he liked the program, to rank our hometown first. He did (this is where he eventually got in). There were a bunch of cities in the middle I didn't have strong opinions on-- I definitely had preferences, but they weren't really strong. He ranked those without much input from me, based solely on how good the program was and our shared vague preferences on the location.

I guess I would echo u/thenobleseacow and say that if you haven't already, talk about the future.  Would you feel more comfortable being married or engaged before you commit to moving with him? That was a big thing for me. Giving up my job, friends, family, and neighborhood was a big commitment, and it's not unreasonable to want a commitment from him, too. Another thing is, if you do move with him and wind up somewhere where you can't get a job quickly, would you BOTH be okay living off of just his salary during residency-- that was a big discussion for us. While I didn't want to stop working (and haven't had to, as it turns out), I had to acknowledge-- and needed him to acknowledge-- that me moving with him might mean me not working for a while, depending on location. What would me as a stay-at-home spouse look like financially, logistically, and emotionally for the two of us? Even though none of that came to be, I'm glad we talked it through. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Check with area churches and other religious institutions for daycares. Most of my friends aren't religious at all, but the majority of their kids go to daycare at churches and a JCC (the one at a JCC is not ethnically Jewish at all). They chose those because those daycares were *much* less expensive than traditional non-religious ones, and the most religious indoctrination that happens is a few bible stories and songs, and most of the Jesus lessons at that age are about being kind, sharing, etc. My friends figure that the kids won't end up remembering much Bible stuff since they'll switch to public school kindergarten at age 5. The oldest of their kids (age 4) has asked a few questions about God and Jesus, and her parents just stick to saying variations of "I don't know, "or "That sounds nice." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't read Murakami anymore. I've read two of his books, and I'm done. He is so beyond terrible at writing women that I think it actually qualifies him as a universally bad writer, even though he's good at a lot of other literary skills. His treatment of female character is just that terrible.  Also, in both the books I read, there were some extremely pedophilic themes toward young female characters that were passed off as normal or unavoidable. He is just an awful writer simply because he cannot write female characters in a way that's remotely realistic or non-creepy. It blows my mind that he wins awards, and I think that speaks a lot to who is giving out those awards, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my experience, and that of other doctors' spouses, doctors are THE WORST at taking care of their own health when they're sick. There's just too much of a culture of not taking sick days for anything. No one takes sick days, so everyone feels like they can't take sick days, so no one takes sick days.... and on and on. I just try to pick up as much slack as possible at home when he's sick.

But on the things I suspect are really serious, I have told him point blank that I don't trust his judgment when it comes to his own health, MD or no MD. After one big incident, he gets it, and now I get to automatically win this argument for the rest of our marriage: despite his insistence that "it was fine," I had to literally call one of my friends whose husband is a neurologist and ask her to get him on the phone to ask him if an out-of-the-blue hand tremor and brain fog lasting for days is in fact something to worry about. The neurologist friend agreed that it was possibly serious and said to go to urgent care to test for kidney failure ASAP. It wasn't kidney failure, but it was still serious enough to warrant full blood testing and an MRI over the next couple of days. It really scared my husband, so hopefully he's more willing to get stuff checked out in the future.

Trust your gut. I'm close friends with one of the women from my husband's residency class now, and I know my friend's husband, the neurologist. If, in the future, I feel like my husband is ignoring something serious, I will go over his head to ask another expert again in a heartbeat. And if they say it's potentially serious, I will never hesitate to hang his previous avoidance of potential kidney failure over his head to get him to get something checked out if push comes to shove. </TEXT>

When she got into the studies, there's even evidence that up to THREE drinks per DAY may not have an effect on fertility or pregnancy, as long as they are drunk slowly enough that most of the alcohol is metabolized before making it to the growing fetus. That just seems crazy, but I guess it makes sense when she explained how alcohol metabolism works.

That being said, the author said she personally wouldn't go that high and to do what you and your doctor feel comfortable with, but she was comfortable at 1/2-1 glass per day during her pregnancy, given the evidence. Also... 3 per day is... a lot even for a non-pregnant person. </TEXT>

For those of you that have been a summer associate, what did you like/not like about your programs? What sort of events did the firm have for you and/or what firm events not exclusively for summer associates were you invited to? What sort or formal review/training did you have?

Any suggestions you have would be HUGELY appreciated. Thanks! </TEXT>

Also, she did mention that they moved out in order to figure out what to do with the dog; the easier solution would have been to immediately drive it to the nearest shelter with no consideration for what happens after that.

But cut her a little slack. She almost lost her child, and she faced years of believing that her child would be sick her entire life, if not eventually die because no one could figure out what was wrong with her as she got sicker and sicker. I have personal experience with a "mystery illness," and I would truly bet money she spent a lot of time afraid her child might die from this, on top of being afraid they would take her away legally. All to find out that if someone had just listened to her, that entire highly traumatic experience could be avoided. She gets to be angry for a while. Frankly, she could probably use some therapy to process this-- anybody would.

And to be clear, I love dogs and am still not 100% over losing my dog to old age 6 years ago. Probably never will be. And I don't have kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a doctor or a lawyer, but I do work in a related area. It is highly, highly unlikely that a physician would risk their license over a dog. Lab screw ups happen, as do false negatives. Given that she had other common allergens show up that would cause those symptoms, it makes sense that the doctor believed that those were the issue, and not an allergy she tested negative for. I don't say this to tell you not to be mad-- I think you get to be mad for a while, because this situation was highly stressful. But I point it out in hopes that you please ignore all the people telling you to sue the doctor for lying about the test. Based on what you've said, it would be a serious waste of your money and emotional resources. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seriously. I just can't see a physician risking their license over a dog. More likely a false negative or lab screw up. #notadoctor, but a quick google search makes it seem like false negatives, while unusual, aren't unheard of, especially in the young. That, combined with the fact her test shows positives for stuff that apparently would cause the same symptoms, makes the allergist's recommendations seem reasonable, even if they ended up wrong. This situation just suck, and maybe someone is at fault legally/ethically-speaking, but it doesn't sound like it's the allergist, if anyone, on the medical side.

[https://www.uofmhealth.org/conditions-treatments/food-allergy/diagnosis-testing](https://www.uofmhealth.org/conditions-treatments/food-allergy/diagnosis-testing), for anyone interested. This post made me curious, because I developed a late-in-life allergy recently. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Similar story I've told in this sub once before: my dad's middle name was after his uncle by marriage, who was also made his godfather in a family where "godparent" is a big deal as far as responsibility and not only an honorary title. Let's call him Timothy. Timothy and his family, my grandmother's sister and their kids, were next door neighbors to my dad's family-- they all were at each other's houses constantly, frequently had regular combined family dinners, etc. Very, very close.

Well, when my dad was 4 my grandparents had to change out godparents and middle names when Timothy left my great-aunt for the nanny, took the kids to another country, had a million more kids with the nanny, treated his family like they were his cult-- robes and everything. They never stayed in one place for more than a couple years. He told the oldest kid (my dad's cousin) that their mother didn't want them anymore and that she should lie to the younger ones who didn't remember-- they were always told that their step-mother (the nanny) was their mother. There is an even more ***wildly*** insane part to this story that I can't reveal without making it easily google-able. Sadly, the kids and their mother (along with a younger half-sister their mother had after she remarried) were separated until after Timothy passed away when they were all adults, but they come to family reunions every now and then these days.

And that's why you don't name kids after living people. You never know who will become a cult leader. </TEXT>

But are there subs that are for memes, jokes, discussion, etc. that are just generally... pleasant?

<TEXT> Everything on the default podcast app is free, which is incredible to me now that you've reminded me. Paid podcasts are on third party new(er) apps like Luminary and Stitcher Premium. But, like you, I didn't listen to podcasts for the longest time because I thought I'd have to pay. If you're into fiction, definitely check out that category on the podcast app. There is some amazing fictional storytelling going on in podcast wordl. You can check out r/audiodrama for recommendations specific to that category. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Amen to Number 1. My PMS symptoms are pretty much exactly like implantation symptoms/early pregnancy, even down to the nausea. I knew that going in and was determined to not read anything into my PMS symptoms. But this month, I got serious smell/food aversion a few days before my period was due. I've always had very light food aversion during PMS, but the smell sensitivity was new, and the aversion was much, much worse. Food aversion and increased smell sensitivity! Classic pregnancy symptoms! YES! Spoiler: am not pregnant. My body just decided to troll me with a brand new PMS symptom right when we decided to start trying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agreed; nowhere does she say that she's actually said or done anything, or that she plans to. It just sounds like she's upset that she missed out on a major life experience for herself-- I can't think of anyone who wouldn't be, at minimum, extremely disappointed that their wedding was essentially cancelled, no matter what the reason. I'm guessing she's mad at the situation and just needs to sort out her feelings, because it's definitely a weird situation full of big and conflicting emotions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yikes. YTB. You handled this poorly. You are marrying into this family, and in years where you’re with them for Christmas, you should respect their traditions. This particular battle was not worth pissing your in-laws off for, and it made you, who is hopefully going to be in their lives for decades, look like someone who is going to be intent on causing drama over the smallest things for years to come. Of course they weren’t going to let you be the only person without gifts under the tree, and saying they just give you money was efficient in your mind, but likely tacky in theirs. When you visit people for the holidays, they will generally expect you to leave room for gifts. I mean, if they gave you an entire pot and pan set or something big like that, they should have sent it to your home and given you a photo, but beyond enormous thing like that....

They should have taken the hint and done small things, but when they didn’t, you should have dropped it until talking holidays next year. They may have thought that you, a new and “unofficial” family member, were just trying to be polite by asking them not to spend money on you. They decided to treat you like family. Instead you created a whole drama your fiancé had to get in the middle of. I would apologize profusely and just tell them that you feel guilty that they all spent money on you and didn’t know what to do with those feelings.

Next year, ask them for charitable donations we’ll ahead of time (and not after they may have already gotten you something, like may have happened this year) but expect that they still might get you something— gift giving is a huge deal in some cultures/families. Seriously, there are entire anthropological texts written on the subject. </TEXT>

Mostly, this tip just prevents a potential headache and is probably only useful when dealing with someone with a less than trustworthy track record. I have dozens of vendors, and there is one that I will be using this on due to past proven dishonesty on their part. Sadly, my company can't stop using them since they have a niche product. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I bought these earrings a while ago and loved them. The same seller has a necklace using the same design. I can't 100% vouch for the necklace, but the earrings from that seller with that same design are great. Only issue is that they are missing the bottom chevron because they are based on the movie rather than the TV show. But I looked around and the earrings were the best I found.

<TEXT> My husband originally wanted to wait until he was done with medical training to even start trying... we would be 33 by then. Granted, having a baby after residency/fellowship is often easier, but 1) there's no guarantee that it will be easier after training; 2) 33 is closing the door if we want to leave open the possibility for 4 kids (we'll probably stop after 2, but 4 is on the table, depending on how things go). 3) On my mother's side of the family, all of the women go into menopause early. They are DONE having kids at 40 on that side. They were all \*well\* into menopause by 41, so no slipping any last kids under the wire. Given how much I take after my mother health-wise, I can't dismiss the possibility of that being me, too. 4) my mom had a lot of trouble conceiving me, and I can't 100% dismiss those genetics given other things I've inherited from her.

Well, we started trying a few days ago at age 31. It's still a year later than I preferred, but it's still fine. We talked about when to start for a long time-- lots of low-pressure conversations to check in with each other over the course of a year and a half. We explained our reasoning to each other, and with more exposure to the topic, he gradually felt more comfortable moving up the time table, and I felt more comfortable waiting a little. But the regular check-ins every month or two were key for both of us.

 I AM NOT YOU. I capitalized that because it's your feelings that matter, and I cannot fully understand your situation since I'm not in it. But if I had your medical history, I would start trying sooner rather than later. The early menopause and genetic trouble with TTC possibility was a heavy factor in us starting when we did. But do what is best for you as a couple-- and that includes taking emotional considerations into account. </TEXT>

I could totally see a situation where someone signs an annual contract in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, etc., and then wants to dispute something in the 2019 contract— a clause that was quietly removed by the other party in the 2020 contract. If the other party were dishonest, they could add a “19 “after the 20 in the 2020 contract to make it contract look like it’s a 2019 contract. I think they would get caught pretty quickly, but there are a lot of idiots in this world. And even if you were to win this dispute eventually, it would be a giant headache that could be prevented just by writing the whole date. Obviously, that’s a really specific situation, but there are a lot of contracts where the date/year of the contract matters a lot. And again, idiots are everywhere </TEXT>

You voluntarily left her in the most physically demanding and terrifying thing she’s ever done and possibly will ever do. If you were my husband I don’t know that you could ever make it up to me. The marriage would be over.
And also, your WIFE in potentially life-threatening labor that could result in the death of your child (which has already happened, asshole!) 5000000% trumps your adult co-worker’s grandfather dying. Every. Fucking. Time. That situation is sad, but you picked your co-workers grief over your wife and child’s life. Fuck you. I hope your wife divorces you.

You didn't get the response you wanted from him, so you humiliated him in front of his children and the woman who cheated on him.

Maybe he just needed more time to privately come to terms with the information. Maybe he and your step mother have some sort of open arrangement that you just partially outed to your grandmother and siblings (unlikely, but possible). The point is that you gave him the information, and then it was his to deal with in his own time and in his own way.

<TEXT> Light- very light- YTA for the "only sheltered crybabies comment." But not for cutting contact and generally trying to get her to pull it together. But she clearly has some major psychological issues causing this reaction. That doesn't mean you have to put up with her over the top behavior, but you also didn't have to say something that essentially equated whatever mental issue she has going on with being a crybaby. That being said, I think most people probably would have lost patience with her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> McKay. I like that he's a great portrayal of "facing your fears is what makes you a hero." I was starting to go through some scary life shit when I started Atlantis. One of the first episodes where he seems so, so terrified to the point of selfishness but STILL charges into that weird alien fog to save everyone else stuck with me through next couple years of serious illness. I figured if someone like that could find it in themselves to be brave, so could I. It was easier to relate to him in that aspect than other SG characters, who rarely, if ever, showed much fear in a way I probably would.

There were days where I would literally ask myself what Rodney would do. I'd let myself be afraid, but I'd do what needed to be done to best of my abilities.

Now, I'm healthy and doing pretty well in life in terms of my happiness. I'm still afraid a lot-- I came out of the illness with a lot of anxiety. But while I don't do it as much anymore, I still occasionally remind myself to be like Rodney. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NAH. I'm giving your relatives the benefit of the doubt and am assuming they object to Josh not knowing his true origins and not simply because he calls his adoptive parents "mom" and "dad." You should have told him when he was younger, but you were so, so young yourself to be taking on something that is both such a huge responsibility and such an enormously delicate situation. You did the best you could, so I don't think anyone can call you an asshole for that (THEY would be the asshole if they did). But I think it's time to get a family therapist that can help you and your wife figure out how to best introduce this information to Josh and then help him navigate it. It's best that he finds out from you and not from someone else down the line. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a tough one, because it sounds like you have a good deal going, and there's no guarantee the next place won't have different or worse issues.

But bats can be dangerous since they can transfer rabies to people. Seriously, this is a very big deal, particularly with a young child in the house who may not realize or be able to articulate that a bat had contact with him-- some people don't even realize they have been bitten or scratched. Bats can squeeze in through the tiniest of holes-- I once saw one squeeze through the itsy bitsy, completely invisible gap between a window and windowframe where the window looked completely closed from both inside and outside.

That being said, bats get into lots of buildings, and it's a fixable problem, and it sounds like it's worth trying to fix this one since it's a good situation for you otherwise. Have your landlords hired a professional wildlife control service to come inspect the home? If the point of entry isn't obvious, you really need an expert to deal with it. If you've already done this, or if your landlords won't do it, I'd move since it's a consistent problem. Rabies is no joke. </TEXT>

<TEXT> YTA. Good lord, the camera isn't even the issue here. You are acting like a child. So is she, but she IS a child. When you married your husband, he and his daughter came as a package deal. You signed up to be a step-mother, whether that was in your life plan or not. Telling a child you don't like her? Deciding that you'd rather just not interact with this child who is the most important person in your husband's life and tell her to stay out of your way? Also, that's right-- if he is a halfway decent person, SHE is the most important person in his life, not you.

If you don't want to learn to be a step-mother, do your husband a favor and get a divorce. But if you want to save your marriage, find a therapist and start learning. It won't be easy, but it will be better than aggressively not trying at all. </TEXT>

Who knows-- one of my friends who I met when her small employer was bought out by my large one found out she was pregnant the day before she was told she would be starting at a new company. She was terrified to tell anyone and ended up telling me while trying to hold back tears during her second week at our company. She wound up thrilled-- she'd moved from a company with zero maternity benefits to one with 6 weeks for people at her level. In the US, I know getting worse benefits is likely, but it can work the other way! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This would be really helpful. One of my friends is on the spectrum and sounds very similar to your gf. It is so, so, SO helpful to know, not only to put her words/actions into context, but to know how to respond. For example, if she is going on and on about a subject and won't let it drop to the point that it's embarrassing and frustrating (like the bingo thing. This is something my friend does sometimes), knowing that she's on the spectrum allows your friends to comfortably (and quietly) tell her, "Hey, I think we need to change subjects now since some people are losing steam." Telling that to a non-autistic person will usually be interpreted as rude and has a higher risk of resulting in a defensive/combative response, so people will be far less comfortable saying something. A friend telling that to an autistic person (according to my friend because #I'mNotAnExpert) will often be interpreted as helpful.

I don't think people on the spectrum should have to initiate every interaction they have with a disclosure statement, but it's definitely helpful for people that are regularly around them if they have trouble masking. If your friends are made aware that they are allowed to (kindly) help your gf with direct statements that would be rude with a non-autistic person, they may feel more comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seriously. I am *very* pro sunscreen, but the first time I saw Dr. Dray, I thought she looked very sick and her skin looked awful. Some of her followers claim that criticism is sexist nonsense because “you’re only saying that because she doesn’t wear makeup.” Like, no. I only wear makeup 1-2x/month(if that), and her sickly appearance is NOT due to no makeup.

Edit: I have no idea if lack of sun is her issue, but to be clear, I don’t think it is— I, along with other relatives, rarely go into the sun without spf due to a significant family history of skin cancer, and our skin looks waaaay better than hers. </TEXT>

Also, I highly recommend the book Expecting Better. It’s by a health economist who analyzes studies related to pregnancy, and she takes so much more realistic and levelheaded view than a lot of other sources, because she knows how to read and analyze medical studies at an expert level when it comes to statistics and study methodology construction. But she has a chapter on fertility and conception that *really* helped calm me down about TTC and chances of conception. The rest of the book on pregnancy it was super interesting, and my friends who have had kids said it helped keep them sane during their pregnancies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’d start with the strips— It makes sense that you want to know your own body. They are much lower investment, and for the vast majority of women, they will do the job  well enough. The tests you’ve taken so far are likely just not showing ovulation since you had the birth control taken out so recently. I think the results would be similar for a woman who knows for sure that she ovulates normally and wasn’t on birth control recently. Personally, I would save the HSA money for now— there are other things down the line that it would be more useful for. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your husband is an asshole and his reaction was not normal. Not at all. Frankly, it is indicative of, at minimum, severe emotional issues he should see a therapist about. But given your reaction to immediately placate him no matter the cost (financial and emotional) to you, I suspect his issues border, if not cross into, emotional manipulation or even abuse, and you’ve just gotten good at not making him angry.

What he said and did was incredibly inappropriate. Please get yourself to a therapist to discuss his behavior in general towards you. Because it sounds like this is just possibly the tip of the iceberg, and a professional can help you sort out what is and is not OK. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I second the pre-baby bucket list. It definitely made the waiting a little easier. I ended up waiting a year to start trying after I wanted to. My husband just wasn't ready yet, which I understand. It was still really frustrating, though. So I came up with things I wanted to do in the meantime:

\-visit breweries and wineries in town. We went at least 1-2x/month.

\- Go on a couple of little trips.

\- Hang out with friends until after midnight sometimes (we'd stopped because sleep is nice even without kids)

\- Try marijuana when we visited a state where it was legal

\-  Play through a couple of long videogames together (he plays while I watch plot-driven games)

\- Learn to make pasta together

\- Read at least one book per week on average. Only read things that are fun, not things I "should" read

We just finally started trying a couple of days ago. But toward the middle-end of the year, while I was still ready, I got to a place where I was more okay (relatively speaking) with waiting a little while longer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA but ONLY because the 4 year old cannot be left alone in a non-childproofed room, particularly in light of the fact that she has almost killed herself by trying to climb on your unsecured bookcase in the past. It's dangerous both for your belongings and the child. Otherwise, your whole attitude about this is pretty entitled and ungrateful.

While you don't give up all of your privacy when you live as an adult with your parents without paying rent (*rent*, not an allowance), you do have to recognize that you are taking up a room they could be using as a guestroom for situations exactly like this one. Your mother is essentially giving you thousands of dollars per year in rent money instead of making it easy for herself to host guests. You should be willing to allow your mom to use your bedroom as a guestroom on occasion *and within reason*. Again, to reiterate: an unattended 4 year old is not within reason. I say all of this as someone who lived with her parents for several years in her 20s-- I thought it was fair to give up my room from time to time when they needed a guestroom. </TEXT>

You don't give up all of your privacy when you live with parents, but you do have to realize that you are taking up room they could be using for something else and strike a balance.

That being said, the 4 year old being left alone in a non-childproofed room is not within reason, particularly since the it sounds like the child has almost been killed by climbing on an unsecured bookshelf in there before. </TEXT>

I always blamed myself for being a slob, being lazy, etc. because my mom was *never* happy with how I cleaned up. I now realize that I'm not a slob and that I'm actually decent at keeping up on housework, but to a much lower standard. It sounds like you do an okay job, and it's nice of you to think of your mother.

Additionally, will you need this boss as a reference for your next job? If so, consider how he will react if you disappear the last couple of days. Is he the type to take revenge by tanking your chances with a future job over something like this?

Basically, given the circumstances, what you should be weighing the joy of taking the trip against is *not* how it will affect the company. Weigh it against how it will affect ***you.*** </TEXT>

<TEXT> As ridiculous as his description is, I love her response and the fact he included it. It makes the whole story sound a whole lot more self-depreciating and in the vein of "Yeah, I said a sexist thing and got smacked down for it."  It also gets a lot less annoying and kind of funny when you realize that it's an older guy reminiscing about his longtime wife telling him to f\*\*\* off the first time the met! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your boyfriend needs to be on your side here. Her comments aren't only rude and body-shaming, they are threatening. Repeatedly talking about beating someone up is weird and threatening on its own, but specifics like she is giving, and the fact she is telling you about how much pain you would be, is a threat whether she means it that way or not. Any reasonable person would interpret it that way and feel afraid of what she might do.

If your boyfriend won't do anything about a family member threatening his girlfriend, this doesn't bode well long term in terms of how much he will support you when it comes to his family-- if you end up partnering with him permanently, you not only get him, you get his family. He needs to tell his sister to knock it off and make sure you are **never** around her when he is not there to back you up verbally and physically, if it becomes necessary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA. All the stuff on who really owns Toby doesn't even matter in light of the fact that **moving would be bad for Toby.** He's old and having medical issues that require trips to the vet who knows him, and having had elderly dogs before, their old age is the worst time to move them in terms of their stress levels-- as you're already seeing in Toby's increased anxiety. If your son truly loves Toby, he will let Toby live out his last few years in a familiar home around the people that are most familiar to him.

Also, I knew several people who got dogs during college. In all but one case, they had to return the dog. In the last case, the dog definitely suffered from the guy's low funds and unstable schedule. Dogs-- especially elderly ones-- are more expensive than people expect. A part-time job is not going to cut it when you take other expenses into account. </TEXT>

It's almost certain that he likes the idea of a relationship but not actual relationships. Your question was not loaded or unfair; it was absolutely reasonable, and it's something more couples (even ones without current problems) should probably talk about.

 He doesn't care about prioritizing you in any way. Cut him loose and find someone who actually wants to be in a relationship with you, and not just wanting to be able to SAY they're in a relationship. </TEXT>

You are *especially* an asshole for withholding a house key you were otherwise going to give her unless you agree to only what you want her to do. Her agreeing to run in the safer part of town is *more* than reasonable, and the fact that you won't even agree to that makes it appear that you are incredibly controlling. The thing about the house key and is really manipulative. You need to reevaluate how to you treat partners in relationships, because a manipulative, controlling partner is a bad partner that women should run from-- no pun intended. </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Pro" tip (not really, because it sounds dumb, but it works): I met one of my now-closest friends when I was at a party an acquaintance invited me to. I straight up announced to the gathering that I was in the market for friends, so let me know if they wanted to get coffee sometime. She said she was also in the market for friends, we went for coffee, and we're still close 6 years later, even after she moved away to another state. By then, I'd gotten close with some other people, too, by reconnecting with some high school acquaintances. Unfortunately, making new friends and "bumping up" acquaintances to friend-level takes some effort as an adult, but it's so worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I made the same cut off about seven or eight years ago. It left me with no good friends. Just a few acquaintances where neither of us had ever made much of an effort.

Years later, I now have a bunch of very good friends who make me feel like a priority, and I prioritize them. Some of them have had kids the last couple of years, and those children are like my nieces and nephews. I put effort into the relationships that put effort into me. Some of those old acquaintances are now some of those good friends, and I met some new people that have stayed in my life. When I stopped chasing after people who didn’t care enough about me to make an effort, my self-esteem went up so much in the long run. And while I have fewer “friendships,” the true friendships I have now are so much better in quality. </TEXT>

It really, really sucks to just be *constantly* rejected by someone. After a certain point, it comes off off as them refusing to prioritize you in their life in any way. I will keep after someone for a little bit, but if they do not accept invitations or try to reschedule to a mutually convenient time (NOT just one that is only convenient for them), I will not make myself feel devalued by chasing after them for ever and ever. Making that a life rule did amazing things for my self esteem. </TEXT>

People grieve in different ways, and that's okay. However, if your sleep disturbances and need for schedule changes go on for more than maybe a few weeks to a month, you might consider seeing a therapist to help you get through this rough time. Experiencing those things does not make you unfair or weird or wrong-- they are just how you grieve, and it's okay!!! Let me repeat: you are NOT wrong to grieve the way you are. But if it keeps *seriously* disrupting your day-to-day life, you deserve the extra help, because you deserve to find happiness again. I won't say that you'll "get over" it and life will feel the same- I still miss my dog so much sometimes, even 6 years later. But you can get *through* it to a new sense of normal. </TEXT>

Eventually, during residency when people say, "Oh, so you're married to a \*doctor.\* You're so lucky!" It will likely feel uncomfortable for a different reason, because you're going to have to suppress irritation. Like, you know you're lucky to have steady income and that things will get better eventually, but you just want to shake people and say, "He's still in training and practically makes minimum wage when you take all his hours into account! He's never home, and when he is, he's still working or exhausted! We have a quarter of a million dollars in med school loans that keep racking up interest, and we're lucky that it's not HALF a million in debt!"

<TEXT> I got my period, which I know is not normally a happy thing in this sub. But right now, I've never been so happy to get it. I stopped my BC a little over a month ago. I was planning on stopping then anyway since we have been planning to start trying for a baby toward the end of this year. Unfortunately, during my last month on the pill, I bled for 17 days straight. By the time I got with my OBGYN, she was unsure as to whether it was due to the endometrial lining wearing down or a chemical miscarriage-- she thought it was more likely the latter based on my symptoms, though. That was a weird time for me. Since then, I've been so scared that my cycle would be screwed up for months and would make TTC impossible for a long time.

I got my period today, which is only a day off of when I expected it! I'm still nervous that it won't work out for a while-- my mother had TONS of trouble getting pregnant with me, and it took half my friends over a year (some 2 years+) to just conceive an eventually-successful pregnancy. But this is the first hurdle-- getting my period again, and ideally, getting one reasonably on schedule to help time conception. I'm so relieved right now. </TEXT>

I wouldn't terminate the business relationship right this second over this if she is not directly mishandling the business-- it sounds like she is still really worked up, and you want that conversation to go as smoothly as possible. Try to wait at least a few weeks, if not a month or two, for her to calm down a little.

If she IS mishandling business stuff, that's a different story. If you can't manage it yourself for a few weeks, you're going to have to try to direct her attention to the business aspect of you're lives, and honestly, if she's REALLY revved up to the point where she won't talk to you about it at all, as a last resort, you might want to engage an attorney to help disentagle her from your business interests. </TEXT>

<TEXT> YTB. If he was texting her when sad, it sounds like they were close friends. Or maybe she she feels awful that she didn't act like a close friend when he reached out to her. The fact is, it doesn't sound like you know what their relationship was after he became your ex. Even if they weren't super close, it doesn't matter.

Loss at a young age is traumatic, even when they're not best friends. A girl I only knew in passing died when we were in high school, and I still think about her at least a few times a year a good 17 years later. She was a few years older than me, and we were next door neighbors, but I didn't see her much. I didn't hardcore grieve after her death, because I truly barely knew her, but her death affected my life fairly profoundly. She was the first young person I knew who died, and death became a palpable thing in my life after that. I watched her family grieve from afar, and the memory of her father's eulogy can still bring me to tears. Even as an adult, it's still the single most heartbreaking thing I've witnessed, and god willing, that I ever will witness. Others at my school felt the same (I went to a small-ish school). I can't imagine how it would have affected me if I'd known her even a little bit well-- even her little sister's close friends needed to take off school for a few days after her death.

If she keeps bringing him up to you, and you're lashing out because you'd rather not talk or think about him, that's fair-- she needs to process verbally, and you need to move on. But just tell your friend that you aren't in a place where you're able to process grief with her due to your own needs. Don't make it about her "grieving too much." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your husband needs to stop drinking. Completely and forever. Not just for a few weeks while he feels the immediate regret. Just because he doesn't drink regularly doesn't mean he doesn't have a problem. Alcohol drove him to hurt you, his wife that he supposedly loves, in a very, very real way. He also needs to get rid of that "friend," who is a very, very bad influence on him and makes you uncomfortable, for obvious reasons. I would expect my husband to 100% cut off anyone who felt it was appropriate to tell him that they were jerking off to me, and I would be considering divorce if he didn't.

He also doesn't get to have nude photos of you anymore. Not until he earns back your trust, which may be never-- that's up to you, and it's reasonable if you never want to take photos again. Ask him for his phone and watch him delete all photos of you (also, from the cloud, if there are any there).

If he can't accomplish deleting the photos and won't make a real go of quitting drinking, consider whether you want to be married to someone who is willing to violate your trust in such a profound way without making any moves to earn back your trust. </TEXT>

>cravings are psychological so I can beat it if I try hard enough.

Pregnancy is the exact wrong time to try to beat food cravings if they are not harmful. It's already psychologically hard enough, and now he wants you to 1) go against your natural cravings at the worst time possible; and 2) figure out new weekly meals, again at the worst time possible.

This all is aside from the principle of the matter, which is also BS. If he wanted a wife that doesn't eat pork, he should have married someone who doesn't eat pork. It's not okay for him to spring this on you after the fact, much less at the most inconvenient time possible for you.

Edit: just realized that you aren't actually married yet. That doesn't change a whole lot, except that it makes him even more of a hypocrite, maybe. </TEXT>

Having a sibling means learning to forgive, conflict resolution, etc. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Obtaining birth certificate for US citizen born to German mother and registered in 1988 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-11-16 00:48:58 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My husband was born to a German citizen in 1988 in the United States, and his birth was registered through the the German consulate. However, over the last 30 years, his German birth certificate has been lost. We’ve researched and found a lot of information on German citizens born in Germany obtaining documents, and for getting birth certificates for new babies, but we can’t figure out how to go about it for German citizens born outside of Germany 30 years ago.

Does anyone know how we would go about this?

Bonus question: would our future children (born in US) qualify for German citizenship through my husband if we register them with a consulate?

Thanks all! </TEXT>

In a marriage, when one person gets injured like that, it doesn't just affect them. It affects their partner and possibly children, if there are any.

<TEXT> My first "real" adult job was a 4 day work week. After 2 years, I got a promotion that came with a 5 day work week. The 20% pay bump (plus more for the promotion) was AMAZING, but in terms of my happiness levels, there was a huge difference between 4 and 5 days. I miss my 4 day workweek. A lot. Getting housework and errands done while still having free time was so much easier. I felt happier and more relaxed both at home and at work. I was definitely more productive per hour at work.

I've also worked a 3 day work week at another company during a period when I was easing back into life after an extensive illness. I needed the extra time to recover and do doctor's appointments, but... 3 days per week for a single person with no kids wasn't enough time at work, even aside from the money issue. I got bored easily, and it was hard to move back into "work mode" when my work week started up again. I did not have that problem at 4 days. 4 days is the way to go.

Edit: each of these jobs had a standard 7.5-8 hour work day. I sometimes work longer days now in the 5 day job, but I don't work excessively long very often. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nagging implies that you repeatedly ask someone to do something in a brusque manner, and that thing doesn’t really need to be done, or at least does not need to be done immediately. And the thing is usually not very important and not worth going on about. What I did was remind my husband to do something that actually needed to be done. It was time sensitive and was HUGELY important.

Basically, nagging carries a negative connotation of overreacting. What I did was not overreacting, and a lot of women who are accused of or feel like they are nagging may actually just be trying to get their husbands to do things that are just necessary for keeping the household running reasonably well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup. The idea of being a “nag” is so socially ingrained when it’s usually just the woman trying to get her husband to do something that actually needs doing. My husband has never accused me of nagging or even acted annoyed when I remind him to do things. He does kind of rely on me to remember things sometimes— there is definitely an imbalance as far as the mental labor in our home goes. But last week, I reminded him for the 10th time in 5 months to finish filling out the paperwork to get disability insurance, and I felt like such a nag. And then I was like, “wait, no. This is something he actually needs to do for the sake of our family, and he’s had plenty of time to get it done.” I put that attitude ON MYSELF just because I’d seen it played out in media and with my own parents so much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I don’t mean for most women, because there are no hard statistics on pain during first sexual intercourse experience. I meant “often” as in “many women” which is supported by anecdotal evidence on several medical sites. I’ve listed 2 below but there are more. My OBGYN was not surprised when I told her that my first few sexual experiences were painful. She said it’s very normal and told me to try more foreplay and to try being on top to help me feel more in control and relaxed. I’ve encountered the concept of the first sexual encounter being painful many times in different types of media, conversations, and even a college health class.

And, yes, many, many women are unfamiliar of what is inside them as far as masturbation goes While it is a pervasive taboo in many religions, in my personal experience, it just doesn’t necessarily occur to all women to stick something inside themselves at a young age. No one ever made me ashamed of my body. It just didn’t occur to me. I didn’t have access to dildos, and it didn’t occur to me that I could use anything else. I probably inserted a finger at times, but that is in no way preparation for penetrative sex. I can’t imagine my experience is unique, and I’m sure others have experiences closer to yours. And while I don’t think you mean anything by it, calling it “insane” that so many women didn’t have similar experiences to yours is a little insulting.

<TEXT> What? That is a really bizarre request. Look, I have a good amount of anxiety about my personal safety due to trauma. I still think it's weird to ask your partner to learn to fight to defend you. Like... get some pepper spray and some therapy. I know that sounds flippant, but that's what she needs to do if she is this nervous about her personal safety. Or she can take the classes herself.

Maybe you can take classes together as a compromise, if that's something you feel comfortable with, but you shouldn't have to participate in an activity that makes you uncomfortable. Your girlfriend needs to accept that and deal with her own issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It will feel really hard, but this could be your line in the sand. Tell your parents that you cannot continue acting as your sister's therapist, because it is affecting your mental health and makes you resent your sister. Your family will be upset, and they will probably tell you that you are hurting your sister. But until she proactively starts working on herself, your sister is the only one hurting your sister. Your family is asking you to set yourself on fire to keep your sister warm. She needs to go gather herself some wood and stop relying on you.

Continue to invite your sister to dinner when it works for you-- that seems like a nice thing to do. Encourage her and your parents (since they seem involved) to get her into therapy. But don't take her on long trips. Don't subscribe to her dictator-like policies for weekly dinners. If she gives you the silent treatment, leave and tell her you won't be around her until she treats you better.

All of this is easier said than done. You might think of going to a therapist yourself to give yourself some support through all of this. Drawing boundaries, especially with family, is hard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Why did you pick the name? If you just like the way it sounds, find other inspirations for it-- famous people, concepts (if it's also a word), etc. that you could tell your friend that you like about the name. Because what you don't want her believing or wondering is that you chose it because you liked it when you heard her stalker's name, which could be construed as naming the baby after a guy who has caused her a lot of pain.

You should make **very** sure to tell her that you didn't choose the name without regard to her situation, which actually sounds a little traumatic if the guy is STILL sending her nudes all these years later-- it really is a big, big deal for her. But being able to tell her all the good reasons you have for choosing the name will help.

But if the stalker has an unusual name, you need to recognize that it will be very, very hard for your friend to hear it regularly when you talk about your baby. Her feelings wouldn't be malicious or arbitrary, and she may even feel guilty about associating them with your baby-- they are a very normal and real response to an awful situation. A guy with a somewhat unique name stalked and eventually assaulted me. Years later, despite therapy, I can't hear the name even in other contexts without an instinctual panic response that I have to work to suppress.

Seriously consider how close this friend is. If my sister named her kid that name, I'd be *really* upset because how could she care so little about what happened to me that *she* doesn't have negative feelings toward the name? If it was just a good friend I talked to only every few weeks (like, close-ish, but not sister-level relationship that some people have with friends), I wouldn't be as bothered if my friend told me some good reasons they picked it. But I'd be upset if they just said "This is my baby, X" and pretended that they didn't know it would affect me. I imagine this wouldn't be as much of an issue if the name is common, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most women don't start out with dildos the size of a human penis, if they ever use a dildo at all-- in fact, most women do much  better with external stimulation during masturbation (and sex, FYI) than with internal stimulation. A LOT of women masturbate without ever internally penetrating themselves and are quite happy doing so.

Sex often hurts the first time, or even the first several times, because 1) the woman doesn't know enough about having sex to know she needs more lubrication; and 2) it's scary, because she doesn't know what to expect and has almost certainly heard it will hurt the first time. This stress causes her to a) release less natural lubricant; and b) tighten up her pelvic muscles subconsciously, which causes penetration to hurt more. It also doesn't help that most women's first time will be with an equally inexperienced partner who is not as gentle and/or slow at penetration as he needs to be, and who may also think that "in further is better" and will hit her cervix, which is painful.

Penetrative sex often gets less painful over time because the woman knows what to expect and relaxes more. She may also realize that she needs additional lubricant and will make sure to use some. But not-so-fun fact: penetrative sex DOES hurt every time for some women due to the above issues never subsiding. Pelvic physical therapy is an increasingly-common field both to assist bladder control (for some women) but also to help loosen pelvic muscles that might cause sex to hurt. Some women also naturally do not produce enough lubricant on their own even when they are relaxed. </TEXT>

She sounds insecure, and that is driving her to be controlling and manipulative. She's using her jealousy to isolate you-- or rather, she's manipulating you into isolating yourself. This is sometimes an early sign of an abusive relationship-- I'm not sure there's quite enough information, but it sounds kind of like she's emotionally abusive given how much she's used manipulation to isolate you.

You should seriously give thought to everything she's forced you to give up and whether she's worth it. Because she doesn't sound worth it from what you've written. This sounds much, much bigger than her just not wanting you to discuss books with a co-worker. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of my anthropology professors in college did a lot of work in the history of anthropology. She said that the Secretary of War was advised by anthropologists and other social academics specializing in Japanese culture/history to remove Kyoto from the list due to its cultural and historical significance to Japanese people. He did not come to that conclusion on his own.

Edit: this wasn't a critique of him. This was in response to the part of the article that speculated that he defended Kyoto due to his personal reasons. While he may have been partial to Kyoto, he had multiple advisers telling him not to destroy that city, and it's good that he listened to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aside from the good legal/financial advice you have gotten, you should seriously think about switching physicians offices. I know numerous physicians, and we had a conversation about this after I had an awful experience where a doctor's front office severe disorganization threatened my health despite the great doctor and nurses. Every single one of the physicians (about 8) agreed that they would never want a loved one to stay with a disorganized medical office for that very reason-- eventually, there is a good chance that disorganization will directly threaten your health. If they cannot keep track of money they are owed, how much can you trust that they are keeping track of things like vaccinations, correct prescription dosages, necessary follow-up care, etc? </TEXT>

She actually tried changing her name, but she didn't like how it felt. That's totally reasonable. But you're allowed to feel sad that she rejected your name. It sounds like you've told your wife how you feel, which is good. But now you need to stop and work on getting over it without putting negative feelings on your wife. Because continually displaying and telling her about your negative feelings about her very, very personal choice that you declined to make for yourself is a form of pressure and guilt, even if you don't mean it to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that kids is a gamechanger. We don't have them but are hoping to start trying for one in the next month. I'll admit, I'm definitely biased here. Staying near family and our current social support system has been a priority in looking towards where his post-fellowship job will be. We've had the advantage of watching many close friends have kids in the last few years.

All of my close friends have had kids in the last 3 years. 5 of them have family in town. 1 does not. My other friends all have somewhat regular date nights, because grandma and grandpa take the kids from time to time. She and her husband rarely have date nights. She would love to go back to work for 8-10 hours per week for the sake of her mental health/getting out of the house, but finding a place that will allow you to only pay for the equivalent of 1-2 days/week of childcare is almost impossible. My other friends didn't have to worry about having emergency childcare for when they went into labor with kid #2. She had to worry a lot (I ended up being her childcare until her mom could drive in from 13 hours away the next day). Like, she struggles to just make herself dentist appointments-- her husband has to take time off from work so she can go to the dentist or doctor. That would be almost impossible if her husband were a physician. It just looks so hard compared to how my other friends with family in town are able to parent, and it would be even harder if her husband hand long and 100% inflexible hours. </TEXT>

The support and social network you BOTH have in your home city sound like a lot to give up. If you were to end up moving to the prestigious program, would the prestige and associated benefits to the program outweigh what you're giving up and how much harder your personal lives would be? You would be uprooting your children from a great school district, going somewhere where you have no childcare or friends, and giving up the income that your job brings in, at least for a while.

<TEXT> I used this question when I hired student workers, too. I got the question from my mom, who used it when interviewing for management-level positions at a chemical company (this is relevant). She interviewed a 22 year old guy who, instead of talking about the time he mixed up some orders or something, decided to tell her about the time he, at the age of 17, built a bomb in his parent's basement just to see if he could. Eventually the police found out because he told one of his friends. The bomb squad got called, his whole street was evacuated, and he got arrested. He was eventually let off due to being a minor.

He finishes this story, and my mom was just dumbfounded, but she managed to ask, "And the second part of the question? What did you learn?" His answer: "Well I learned to not tell my friends that I'm building a bomb."

This guy thought it was a good idea to share that he was into building bombs and got arrest for it 5 years earlier... while interviewing at a chemical company. FFS. </TEXT>

In the interview, I asked her, "Can you tell me about a mistake you've made and what you learned from it?" This question is very relevant for gauging a person's judgment. She is quiet for a several seconds. No problem. So I say, "Please feel free to take a minute to think about it." A solid 2 minutes go by before I finally say, "We can come back to this at the end of the interview if you'd like." She says okay.

We finish the rest of the questions.

Me: "Okay, why don't you take another minute to think about the question pertaining to the mistake you've made and what you learned from it."

Her: "Nope, I'm good."

Me: "Oh, are you not interested in the job anymore?"

Her: "Oh, I'm still interested."

Me: "So would you like to answer the question?"

Her: "No, I *said* I'm good."

For women, it is not a given that we will orgasm at the end of sex. It is not a given that we will even be physically comfortable during sex-- sometimes, for some many women, it can even hurt if they aren't relaxed or lubricated enough. Or if you are so focused on yourself that you just keep hitting their cervix. Usually most of those issues can be easily solved if the guy would just slow down and spend a little more time on foreplay. Your attitude is gross. Edit: elaboration on physical issues </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP, listen to this. I was in your position at one point-- not with an in-law, but with a friend who had a girlfriend. He escalated and escalated and relied on my guilt in letting the behavior get so far. Eventually, instead of it being HIS secret, it felt like MY secret-- he even told me it was "our" secret after he isolated me at a party and raped me after months of escalating behavior like you and /u/VintagePoet82 describe. He even went so far as to say that his girlfriend might kill herself if she found out about "our affair."

The crazy thing is that I felt so guilty and so afraid of making a scene in our friend group that I believed him. Even though I'd asked him to leave me alone for months and even told him no in the moment, I felt like I'd somehow consented because I could have told his girlfriend at any time leading up to that. So I stayed quiet until he pulled the same trick on me again. I felt stupid for letting it happen again, but that time I actually fought back and it "felt" more like rape. So I finally told her, but it still felt like I'd participated in an affair that just took a wrong turn. It took me months of therapy to understand what /u/VintagePoet82 laid out so well.

Get ahead of this issue and don't let it get as far as I did-- alert your sister and when you're with him, don't be afraid to be assertive about your boundaries. "Don't touch me!" and "I don't want to be alone with you. Get out of my way." But be aware that your sister may not believe you or may not want to believe you. I found out later that the guy who raped me pulled the same trick on another woman who DID tell his girlfriend early on that he'd tried to corner her at a party after months of "flirting" with her, and he convinced his girlfriend somehow that it just couldn't possibly be true. If he is good at manipulating you, he's probably also good at manipulating his spouse. After hearing the same story from two women, she left him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA. I’m shocked at all the people saying “well, she’s just making sure unauthorized people can’t kidnap children.” That is a priority, but there are methods for preventing both that and situations like this— namely, the pickup list. The TA should have had the list, and since she didn’t, the correct response would have been, “Sorry, I don’t have the authorized pick up list with me. Could you please come with me while I go get it? Or do you have a photo of you and the kids on your phone?” She didn’t have to bring race or appearance into it; in fact, she should be checking EVERYONE she doesn’t recognize, regardless of appearance.

Mixed race families are far too common these days for “well, the kids don’t look like you,” to be a valid response to this situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I 100% believe this happened. The last time I flew, I watched a flight attendant berate a mother whose toddler was crying and just wouldn’t calm down. I was across the aisle from her, and that woman was doing EVERYTHING she could to calm her baby. None of the passengers around us complained and several of us were trying to help the mom distract the baby as best we could. But the FA took it upon himself to come find the woman with the crying baby and say, “You need to calm your baby down.” The woman apologized and said she was trying. He looks down at her and said, “well try harder. I’ve never met a *good* mother that couldn’t calm her own child down. Please don’t fly again until she’s older.” The woman had tears running down her face as he walked away. It turns out she on her way to introduce her baby to her brother, who was finally on leave from the navy, and the damn airline bumped her husband. So she was unexpectedly solo parenting a cranky baby.

As soon as we touched the ground, me and several other passengers messaged the airline to complain on her behalf. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Several years ago, a friend from college who went MIA for 3 years messaged me saying something like, "Hey, I know I fell really out of touch for a while; I'm really sorry. I was going through some pretty significant personal issues. I wish I hadn't let that get in the way of me maintaining my end of our friendship. Next time I'm in town, I'd love to get together for dinner." I was SO excited that he'd reached out. But maybe you could write something like that?

The last couple of years, he stayed at my house 1x/per year, and we keep in touch. I'm sure we'd see more of each other if we lived in the same time zone. In that initial message, he didn't get into what all had happened in his life-- I don't think he was ready. You don't have to tell everyone everything either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think tips about communication is really helpful. I'll recommend a book called Crucial Conversations-- it was originally written for business people, but the model has since been expanded to personal settings. I get emotional when my husband and I disagree, and that book was hugely helpful in helping me communicate with him better so that I 1) don't get as emotional in the first place; and 2) am able to better tell him why I'm getting emotional. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got proposed to on the living room after we watched a TV show with takeout on the couch. It was as low-key and simple as could be, and it was perfect. My husband made it special by what he said and how he acted. What he didn't do is throw a ring at me while I was in the bathroom and say, "Hey want to get married? Yeah? Great." If he had asked that way OP's boyfriend did, I'd have been really concerned about how seriously he took the commitment he was making and asking of me, and I'd wonder why he didn't know me well enough to know that I'd be upset by him casually asking me in the room I shit in right before I had to wrangle a kid to get out of the house. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA. I say this to someone who got proposed to on the living room couch after we ate takeout and watched TV. But it's what I wanted, and my husband still made it special by the way that he asked and how he acted after I said yes. Our simple engagement story is a far cry from a guy throwing a ring at you in the bathroom like, "Hey want to get married? Yeah? Great. Let's go."

And I believe women should absolutely 1) be involved in choosing the ring; or 2) free to return the ring if it's something they're not comfortable with for reasons like the ones you describe. It's something they are supposed to wear every single day for the rest of their lives-- they should be 100% comfortable with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Go on the date if you enjoy spending time with Jessica. But be up front that you want to take it slow and why you want to take it slow.

A friend of mine lost his first wife tragically and suddenly, and it almost broke him. About a year later, he met and started dating his new wife. He was still grieving, and he told me he continues to grieve to this day, but he's just learned to balance the grief with living his life with some joy. And now he has someone to support him on days when it hits him especially hard. That relationship was what brought him out of his depression. I'm not saying that a new relationship will fix your grief-- I don't think that should be the goal. But I'm saying it could go well, and if you feel like you are in a place to try, you can grieve *and* date at the same time if you feel like you want to try. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This right here. There are solutions available that should enable her to support her brother for the most important day of his life-- even if she just zips in right before the ceremony (after the pre-ceremony champagne) with a sober buddy (even if that person is OP) and the run right back out again before the bar opens up again for the reception. The brother's words were hurtful and mean, but I'm guessing they were in response to years of his sister's problem being the center of the universe, not just in response to her declining the wedding.

But from brother's perspective, his sister has been failing to support and hurting her family for years, and she's just repeating that behavior, but now just for a different reason. He's TA for what he said, but he's not the monster everyone's making him out to be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mother is 13 years older than my aunt who was a raging alcoholic, and was well out of the house by the time problems arose. My aunt still managed to hurt my mother with phone calls, how she treated family members that my mother cared deeply about, and the way my mom had to plan different family events around her problem. She hurt even hurt me (her niece who lives in another state) somewhat, because I HATED seeing someone treat my mother so poorly and cause her so much stress. Your son didn't have to physically be in the house to be greatly affected by his sister's alcoholism.

It doesn't make what he said right, but people are acting like those words in response to a single invitation decline by your daughter. If your daughter was anything like my aunt, your son's words were likely in response to years of putting up with your daughter's behavior. Everything always revolved around her alcoholism, and he asks her to turn up for an hour or less to the biggest day of his life, and from his perspective, her problem is still causing her to be unsupportive. Again, his words were overreactive, but I don't think your son is the monster everyone is making him out to be.

I do wonder why she isn't making it a bigger priority to find a sober buddy (even you!) and find a way to zip in right before the actual ceremony (not pre-ceremony champagne time) starts and zip out again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah... I can see the brother's perspective here: after years of her causing chaos and pain for him their loved ones, he asks her to turn up for one single ceremony to show support for him on the most important day of his life... and yet again, her alcoholism is an excuse. Obviously, it's different because she's actually getting help now. But I do find it to be a little bullshit that she can't figure out a solution for a sober buddy-- whether an extra guest or her father-- to help her get through a ceremony that's no more than an hour. She doesn't even have to go to the reception. She could find a way to zip in after the pre-ceremony champagne OP says will be there and then zip out again before the reception. The fact that she isn't looking for a way to support her brother the one time he asks would piss me off too if OP's sister had acted for years like alcoholics in my family did.

"You're dead to me" sounds like a gross overreaction until you take into account the years of pain that most alcoholics put their close friends and family through. It's still not a nice thing to say, and the brother should have handled it MUCH better. But his response isn't so out of left field when you consider it a response to years of painful misbehavior, rather than just toward her missing one event.

Edit: added info about the pre-ceremony champagne after reading a comment from OP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> YTB. I mean, given the language you use to frame it, you ARE mocking sexual assault. You don't have to use terms like "groomed" to describe it if you're going to tell it as a funny story to a bunch of people whose histories and senses of humor you don't know. The foot massage that happened to you was not okay, but I'm glad you've found peace with it and can even laugh about it. But given that you frame it in terms usually used for sexual abuse, you cannot and should not expect everyone else to be comfortable with the way you tell it.

And while you may think all of your female friends who have been assaulted are okay with the way you tell the story, have you asked all of them in a private setting where they don't feel pressured to agree with you? For all I know, you have, but it would be surprising. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People have said it, but I'll say it again: police. police. police. Call the police.  **Someone is trying to get your wife raped and worse. Call the police yesterday and tell them someone is actively trying to contract out the kidnapping and rape of your wife.**

This has been going on for 10 years, so you're assuming there is no urgency. I would argue that there is, because the guy who decides to take the post at face value could be looking at it right now and making plans to grab your wife tomorrow. I know that sounds like fear-mongering, but it's not. Given the circumstances, it's a very realistic possibility of something that could actually happen. Call the police, and do not mention the word catfishing or start with "someone is impersonating my wife online." Start with "Someone made a post online to commission others to kidnap and rape my wife." Then get into the details after you've got their attention.

And please consider therapy for your wife. She has been going through something traumatic for years, and even if they were to catch whoever it is tomorrow (unlikely, things move slowly), the legal process alone is going to keep the situation in her life for a while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Usually good advice, but my husband just went to a dinner as a current fellow for interviewees. There was an applicant there who apparently told a loooong and over-enthusiastic story about how he hit a rabbit with his car. He went into description-- while people were eating-- of all the blood, gore, and bits of fur stuck to his car. *And then* he tried to force other people at the table to tell about times they killed animals with their cars. The other people didn't feel comfortable, but he kept pushing the subject 3-4 times, particularly focusing on two female co-interviewees (and the only 2 women at the table), who kept dodging the question.

My husband is veeeerrry go-with-the-flow and is has never been put off enough by someone to do anythingabout it-- usually, he doesn't even notice when someone is being weird. But he and the other current fellow at the table found the behavior disturbing enough to independently report it to the interview committee, which took it pretty seriously.

So TLDR: If you are really, really, creepy, don't be yourself. But usually, be yourself is the best plan. Unless you're way too into road kill. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay, most of the advice saying that you should call the HOA first is missing a key step: ***read your HOA documents first.***

This will prepare you for what kind of phone call you have. 1) You may find no guidelines that relate to outdoor decor-- then you can just tell Karen this if she complains. 2) You find that there *are* guidelines that would apply to you. In this case, tell Karen that if she makes a complaint, you will make sure that rule is applied to *everyone*.

But if you don't read the rules, and there is a guideline that applies, *and* you call the HOA first like everyone is recommending, you will basically be reporting yourself (and Karen) for HOA violations. Reading them first also has the advantage of you knowing your rights when it comes to dealing with Karen and the HOA. But seriously, read them first.

Edit: it may also be that there are outdoor decor rules that would (stupidly) apply to you but not to Karen, based on the differing types and amounts of decorations you both have. The rules may be stupid, but they could still screw you if you don't know about them, and *especially* if you don't know about them and then call and essentially report yourself but are unable to take Karen down with you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Omg nooooooo. NTB. Ask him to leave. People who work in asset protection can afford apartments with roommates-- it's just not necessarily the apartment this guy wants. This guy is utter and complete asshole. Like, you may love him, but objectively, there is literally nothing redeeming about him when it comes to how he treats you. Whatever nice things he says to you, he's saying them to get you to keep supporting him (that being said, those things aren't necessarily untrue-- it's just that his motivation is awful). I say this as someone who has had problems drawing boundaries in the past-- you should think about going to therapy. The fact that you are letting him do this to you is not healthy for you, and it's not normal. It doesn't mean you're bad or terrible; it just means that you need some help in this area of life, like other people need help budgeting or cooking. It will help you not fall into a similar relationship in the future-- it definitely helped me.

This guy is using you, but I don't think you can throw him out due to tenants rights (but you might consult an attorney, or if you're not ready for that step, double check this on r/legaladvice). But you can *ask* him to leave. But he may not go. If he's not on the lease, you can also pay to break the lease and move somewhere else. Then he's your landlord's problem (although you may still want to run that scenario by an attorney or r/legaladvice, too). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess I just don't know how to feel. My husband and I are going to start trying in 2 months, and we're at the point where if we accidentally got pregnant before then, we'd be overjoyed. I had some unusual bleeding, and it was strange enough that I messaged my doctor. She asked me some questions, and she determined the most likely explanation is an early miscarriage. All the symptoms match exactly, and there was definitely an opportunity for me to get pregnant in the first place even though I was on the pill (I took antibiotics and didn't use backup since it was supposedly day 1-7 of my cycle, and we decided we'd be happy with a pregnancy if it happened just a couple months earlier than planned).

I guess... I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about it. While it's highly likely I was pregnant, it isn't 100%. And I lost it before I even realized it was there. I feel a little sad, but should I be sadder? Or should I not be sad at all since the situation was so nebulous from start to finish? I guess I just feel weird, and I'm missing something that maybe never even existed, or if it existed, was gone before I knew it was there. </TEXT>

Fortunately, they left him alone. If it's the level of "shady" where your personal safety is actually at risk, I'd say do the best you can healthwise for 3 months and pick the safer neighborhood. Also, if you will be constantly worrying that your safety is at risk to the point that it affects your mental health, I'd give it a pass, too. Especially since you only have to wait for 3 months for a better living situation.

Go pick up a gift card to a second hand baby clothing store (where I'm from, they're called Once Upon a Child, but just google it), and give it to your sister when you go to get the stuff back. And apologize to your wife when you bring the bin home. </TEXT>

Especially that part about how she refused to leave the hospital room-- your wife was in the most vulnerable state of her life, and she gets to dictate who is and is not allowed in the room with her. Full stop. Even if your mother was a fantastic, wonderful person, your wife gets to say she doesn't want her around while she's in labor (***many*** women with great in-law relationships make the same decision, and their in-laws usually understand and leave her alone during labor). Moreover, she made her wishes abundantly clear, and you wrote this with a slant that makes your wife seem like the unreasonable one. It makes both you and your mother sound like jerks. And the fact that it went on long enough that security had to drag her out of there makes her seem exactly like the kind of person your wife would want to protect her child from.

You stopped talking to your mother for 2 years for a reason, and it wasn't just because she yelled at your wife once during an argument. It's telling that you elected to not mention any of the stuff that would most likely make your mother look awful. Start supporting your wife. Maybe go to couples counseling. But stop making your wife seem like the crazy one when it sounds like she's the one trying to do the responsible thing here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not "wrong," but it may not be advisable only if it's making you feel resentful of him or feel "trapped." However, if you just aren't feeling it but are otherwise fine, go for it. I have sex with my husband when I'm not feeling it pretty regularly-- I know he likes it, and it makes me happy to make him happy. Some days I do say no, but mostly I feel good about making him happy. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

However, if you do find yourself feeling resentful toward him or feeling upset, then there's an issue-- it's not that you're a bad person for doing it, it's just that you may want to reexamine your sexual life with your husband for the sake of your own mental health and the health of your marriage. There's not wanting to say no, and then there's feeling like you *can't.* You were feeling upset enough to come post here; you may want to consider *why* you don't feel like you can say no. Do you just not like disappointing him? What would happen if you did sometimes? You may just want to talk to your husband. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She is not a friend. Give your husband a head's up that your friend is being crazy, if he doesn't already know. Then tell (or text her, if you don't want the confrontation), "I might be pregnant at your wedding if I am lucky-- we really want another child. If that is a problem for you, then I don't think you should rely on me as a bridesmaid." IMO, best case scenario is that she tells you that she doesn't want you as bridesmaid anymore-- this does not sound like drama you want to be involved in, and it would be so much worse to be dealing with if you do get pregnant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA. There are people who actually need straws due to disability. My 13 year old cousin, who is disabled to the point that she will die in a few years, is one of them. Her mother has reusable straws she takes with her, but she only recently found reusable ones that are the right material and pliable enough for my cousin— they tried like 20 straws (maybe more) before they found these. Before that, the plastic one use straws were the only things that worked. And I can definitely see a day when she’s trying to get my cousin, her wheelchair, her medications, liquid food supplements, pain killers, blankets, etc. out the door and forgets a straw— there is A LOT of stuff that goes with a severely disabled child.

The reason restaurant still offer straws at all is for people like my cousin. She’s not there to kill a turtle. She’s just trying to have a drink of water. My cousin’s disability is obvious now, but many peoples are not. There was a period of time when the disease that’s killing her was still in early stages and she didn’t really look disabled, but she still did not have enough control over her muscles to perform fine motor skills like holding a glass of water.  That waitress would’ve asked her mother if she wanted to kill a turtle,  and meanwhile her child is sitting over there literally dying and needing a straw.

That waitress was being an asshole on purpose, and you just pointed it out in the most perfect way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a good lifehack in general for keeping in touch with people, but I think it's a good "mental hack" for people who deal with mental/emotional issues regularly that 1) cause them to withdraw socially; or 2) lean on their friends for support. I deal with anxiety and introversion that causes me to withdraw, so this has helped a lot. But I've also been on the flip-side of the second reason, where one of my friends only reaches out to me whenever she's going through a problem (she's been going through some stuff the last few years, so the problems have been frequent). I want to be supportive, but it also pushes me toward compassion fatigue-- looking forward to talking to someone is hard if I only ever hear about their problems, even if they are important problems!

Being social can be hard if you're introverted and/or have chronic anxiety or depression. But even if you only send a text every few weeks/1x per month on your okay or good days that says, "Hey! How's it going? How is your new job?" (or whatever is going on in their life)... even a quick text conversation will help you stay in contact with friends *and* help your friends/support system feel like you value them as friends-- which is good for being a good friend for them and keeping your support system intact for when you need it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do I [31F] explain the difference between using friends as support and using them as surrogate therapists to my very negative friend [32F] </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-09-26 21:42:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> TLDR: Work friend is almost always negative/complaining and uses us as therapists. How do we explain to her what the line is between asking friends for support and misusing them as surrogate therapists?

One of my work friends has, for the 4 years I've known her, always been *incredibly* negative about things/people in her life. She also tends to focus on her own problems/emotions to the near-absolute exclusion of everyone else's unless she's worrying about what people think about her. She is also constantly looking for validation. It's just so draining to be around her. Every conversation is mostly negative, and is barely a conversation. Every problem she has sounds like a crisis coming from her-- for instance, every single time she's even a little busy (common in our profession), it's 5 solid minutes of hearing about how she's drowning in work and might fail everything and get fired. But if you mention a problem to her, she will almost always change the subject to tell you about a problem she has that's related, and it's often implied that it's worse. She responded that way when I told her my husband might have a very serious health condition! Another one of our friends is on the receiving end of this too and is about as fed up with it as I am. We think she does this to others, because she doesn't have many friends-- they tend to drift away. Honestly, I might have by now if I didn't work with her.

It's sad, because she clearly has terrible self esteem and needs a therapist, but she shut that idea down when I brought it up a while ago. She can *definitely* afford it-- I am 100% sure. But she just uses us as therapists.  We have our own mental health and problems to worry about! I see my own therapist to work through stuff! I will admit that I've hit the threshold for compassion fatigue towards her. I'm going through a couple of minor crises (minor-- our house is flooded and currently unlivable, but we have supportive family to stay with and insurance will cover it; family members having very, very serious health scares that have turned out ok; my chronic anxiety increasing due to both those things). I don't have the bandwidth to listen for 10 minutes about what "awful" and truly trivial thing just happened on her vacation. Because I know it's something. It always is. This negativity/lack of reciprocity was bothering me before all these recent events in my life.

But I and our other friend don't want to come off as "I never want to hear my friends problems," because that's not it. I like supporting my friends and listening to their complaints-- I frequently do with others-- but 1) it's not the majority of every single interaction; and 2) there is reciprocity. There's a line between asking for support and using friends as therapists, and she's crossed it. I know I've put some thoughts down, but does anyone have a good way to better explain that line? We may have to have this conversation with her, because we work with her and can't exactly avoid her forever. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Home with severe water damage; meeting with adjuster in a couple days and don’t know what to expect </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-09-22 13:20:51 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A pipe had a pinhole rupture in my home and caused *severe* water damage to about a quarter of my first floor hardwood floorboards/subfloor, some walls, and my crawl space. We did not lose much personal property, fortunately— only one cheap winter coat that was in contact with a closet wall that mold was starting to grow through. The plumber said the pipe burst was freak accident that was unpreventable.

As soon as we figured out what was happening (water seeped through a floorboard seam), I shut off the water. We had a plumber and a water remediation company working on the problem within 12 hours of discovery (which happened late evening). The remediation company is currently trying to dry out the floor, but we are definitely going to lose a lot of it, which means having to redo our whole first floor since it is an open floor plan. They are ripping out the floor and subfloor directly in front of our front door and stairway up to the bedroom and bathroom (first floor bathroom is in the remediation zone). The remediation guy said the whole process may take 3 months. Currently, our kitchen/living area is cut off from bedroom and bathroom by plastic sheeting (with zippers) and a ton of loud machinery doing the drying. It is very difficult, but not impossible, to navigate across that area without tripping. It is very difficult when carrying things, though— like suitcases or laundry.

We are currently in with my parents, but we can’t do that for much longer due to commute times for work— my husband is contractually obligated to be within 30 minutes of his work during certain weeks, one of which starts in 10 days or so. We also have a cat that cannot come to my parents house due to allergies.

The adjuster is coming in a couple days. What can I expect? What should I say or not say? Is there anything I should be doing other than get photos from the remediation company— they have been good at documenting so far and have worked with my insurance company a couple of times in the past. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in the ER with my husband a few weeks ago (he's fine now! Yay!). I took him there and stayed with him while they ran some tests. He was lying on a bed, hooked up to IVs, and to the monitoring machine. I was dressed in jeans shorts and a tanktop with a sweater, and here's the kicker: *I was lying down in the bed with him.* It was getting late, we were both tired and scared, so I was laying down and holding him.

Cue some random middle-aged lady opening the curtain. She's wearing a patient's gown.

Her: Can you unhook this for me?

Me: \[ignores her, because I didn't see her, and there's been tons of noise outside our curtain for a while\]

Her: Hey! Can you unhook this for me?

Me: \[looks up, sees her gesturing to her IV\] Umm... no? I don't work here.

Her: Oh. I guess I'll find someone else \[turns to leave, then turns back\]. Unless you know how to do this?

Me: No.

Like, I was in jeans shorts, laying down in a bed cuddling someone behind a closed curtain, and her first thought was that I MUST work there. It makes me really concerned for what she thinks nurses actually do. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How do I [31F] "break up" with a friend [32F] I work with </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-09-03 22:30:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been friends with a woman from work for \~4 years since I started at my company. We hang out once every 4-6 weeks.

I've excused her on a lot of this over the years, but the way she talks to and treats me has just gotten to be too much. She is \*constantly\* asking for validation, which is extraordinarily emotionally draining. Her self esteem isn't great. I lightly suggested she see a therapist (I do, once/month), and she shot that down HARD. I mostly gray rock her now when she gets like that. To be honest, this is kind of the biggest issue as far as frequency and day-to-day emotional exhaustion on my part when it comes to her.

She almost never asks; she demands. She almost never says anything like "Could you please....?" or "Would you be able to...." She almost always phrases things as "I'll need you to...." It's a small thing, but it's all the time, and I've realized that it makes me feel like a subordinate or an assistant (she does this to everyone we work with).

She always asks way too much of my time and pushes when I say no. She's said several times we should do a "girls vacation," which I've said is too much for me, and that I don't do trips with friends (largely true). She asks for all-day or even overnight hang outs... I've got a husband to get home to, and also, I've told her that is just too much for me to deal with. I'm an introvert, and that length of social time is draining, even with my own family. She knows my answer on these things, but she keeps pushing. I do not have this issue with any of my other friends, most of whom, TBH, I'd probably be willing to travel with if it came up, because being with them is not as mentally exhausting.

Most recently, my husband was facing a possibly \*huge\* life-changing medical diagnosis-- the stats were very, very high on his symptoms that it would be something bad, and we were waiting for test results to come in (we now know he was very lucky to be in the small % of people with a fixable, temporary issue, so YAY!). I told her what was going on, and not 2 minutes later, she's telling me about how she needs to check in with her mom about that status of an elderly family friend who had apparently been admitted to the hospital 10 days beforehand-- she had never mentioned this person to me before, ever. She went on about how worried she was and seemed like she was looking for support from me. Like... I was on the verge of tears because there was a high likelihood that my husband would told he would be disabled for life or even worse. I very obviously did not have the bandwidth to be her support for someone she hadn't bothered to mention or even check with her mom on in over a week. This is the most egregious example of her not really caring about what's going on in my life, but I realize this has been consistent behavior on her part.

Basically, all of these things just make me not want to be around her. I know I'm not the first-- I don't think she has many friends, and a lot of people at work are VERY annoyed with her for the way she talks/acts towards them in the professional context. At work, this isn't really an issue since we don't really have too much time to socialize during the day-- not even really over lunch. But she keeps asking to do things outside of work, and I can only be "busy" for so long. But I do not want drama getting out at work. Any ideas as to the best way to tell her that I don't want to see her outside of work while minimizing any drama at work?

TLDR: I want to "break up" with a friend from work with minimal drama at work. </TEXT>

<TITLE> UPDATE to I got my company to start paying its interns </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-07-04 17:51:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> A few months ago, I posted that I had convinced my company that it would be better to offer a salary to our interns after years of them not doing it and getting.., not great interns. Obviously, paying is better ethically. But I convinced them that it would be a good business move as well. Boy did I underestimate how good a business move it would be.

By offering a salary, the quality of applicants we got for the internship went up astronomically. For the first time, our biggest hiring problem was that there were too many really, really good applicants, and we had an extremely difficult time narrowing it down. We ended up hiring 2 interns at $10/hour. I wasn’t thrilled with the salary, but it was something.

Their internships are not even over, and one of them has already been hired on as a full-time employee at a regular salary and benefits. A position opened up, and he had done so well at his internship so far that the higher ups immediately offered him the job even though he is not quite done with school yet. They will work around his class schedule while he finishes. The other intern is younger and not ready for a full-time position, but they loved his work so much that they are offering to extend his internship through the academic year at 10-15 hours/week. They are also increasing his salary to $12 an hour.

The new paid internship program has gone so well that my company is expanding the internship program next year and budgeting for an even higher intern hourly pay. They have found that hiring  interns is a great way to test out possible full-time hires. But my company realizes that to do that, they must offer a good salary to attract the best interns. They are also investing in sending me to training and management seminars focused on running internship programs.

People, if you are in a position to talk to your bosses about offering paid internships, offering a salary isn’t just a good ethical decision (although I think everyone in this sub knows that should be a good enough reason, it’s often not a good enough reason for business owners/managers). It is a good business decision for long-term hiring strategies. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got coffee with a friend of mine and she asked me about my husband’s job. He’s currently a GI fellow.  This conversation eventually got to her saying that she assumes that most doctors just got into it for the money and not for the compassion... “oh but not [your husband]. He seems more compassionate than most people.” I flat out told her that I didn’t know any doctors that were in it just for the money and that my husband said the few people he suspected who were only in it for the money dropped out in med school, because it’s really, really hard, and they realized it wasn’t going to get less hard any time soon.  Rather than take the hint, she came back and said “well I’m sure the money is a good motivator.”

Like, yes, we are looking forward to when we start making in attending salary. But most of my husband’s residency colleagues are now attendings and stayed in our city. I don’t know a single one who doesn’t stay late to take care of their patients. I don’t know a single one who hasn’t sacrificed significant time with their families in favor of making sure their patients are taken care of. If they were just in it for the money, they would tap out at five. The sacrifices I know of includes pregnant doctors who worked up until a few hours before going into labor, and  a male doctor who had to duck out to see a few of his patients while his wife was in active labor— she went early, and his backup couldn’t get to the hospital for a couple hours for whatever reason. This also includes an attending who went back to work five days after her husband’s funeral, because if she didn’t, her patients would have to wait get the procedure that she specializes in (she’s one of a few in the state who can do it). If she had taken another few weeks to be with her kids (!), her patients still would’ve gotten the procedure, but she went back because those weeks would have been extremely physically painful for her patients. All of those doctors sure as hell weren’t just in it for the money.

I am just so mad at my friend for saying those things, and there’s really no one I can rant to about it other than this sub. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My husband and I just finished Horizon Zero Dawn, and omg, I adored it. He plays through games we pick together while I watch, direct the action, and yell at him "TAKE A POTION YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE ALSO PROXIMITY ALERT BEHIND YOU!!" I love watching a movie I get to direct-- it's not that he's not letting me play or that I don't think I can learn-- I hope I'm not insulting anyone in this sub with that set up!

We've previously played through Witcher, too, and I loved when we played as Ciri. We just started God of War, and after playing as Aloy, I'm kind of meh on this one. It's good and we'll play it through, but I want Aloy back! We also tried Last of Us, but the hyper-realistic violent dystopia gave me nightmares, so we stopped. Watching my husband play through the the games I just named is basically the only exposure I have in this gamer world, so it's all pretty new to me. Are there any other fantasy-esque plot-based games with really awesome female protagonists (or at least, like Ciri, major supporting characters you can play as)? </TEXT>

A good example of what I'm thinking of would be Wild Thing, which takes a serious journalistic look at the urban legend of Bigfoot and the community of people who believe in it. No Man's Land is another good example.

I've seen recommendations for positive podcasts like Wonderful! or Humans Being Bros, and those are awesome, but I'm really hoping for some recommendations that feel more like investigative journalism. Any ideas? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Not eating to bring down blood sugar-- newly diagnosed with limited information; x-post from r/diabetes_t1 </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-04-19 16:53:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> x-post from r/diabetes_t1.  One of my friends (30 years old) was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes two days ago and is *extremely* overwhelmed. I asked her if I could try to find some answers to some of her questions, so she knows I'm looking into this for her. Long story short: after being diagnosed 2 days ago and being sent home with limited information, she thinks that not eating for 10+ hours is necessary to bring down her sugar levels. Is that correct? She has other questions, but that's the one at the top of her mind.

 She has an appointment with a dietician next week, but during the diagnosis appointment a couple days ago, her endocrinologist basically just gave her a meter, some insulin, a chart for how much to administer based on blood sugar levels, and a pamphlet. My friend also came away with the impression that she shouldn't eat if her blood sugar is high. With her sugar over 200, she went over 10 hours without eating, and the number did not dip at all. She finally broke down and ate a small salad, after which her blood sugar went even higher. She's absolutely panicked now but acknowledges that "never eat again" is probably not the answer. Her doctor's  office hasn't been returning messages, so here I am on reddit for her (she's going to get a new endocrinologist after she gets the immediate situation under control). Here are the questions she asked me to look into:

* Should she be skipping meals and snacks to that extent? Or should she just go ahead and eat her regular meals while sticking to low-carb foods, even if that will raise her blood sugar?
* As a new Type 1 diabetic, should she be focused on eating low carbs AND low cholesterol? That's what Google keeps telling her. If she doesn't cut cholesterol right away, is that a huge problem? She's just now trying to wrap her head around cutting carbs to get her sugar down. She is normal, if not under-weight, if that matters.
* And this one breaks my heart... if she goes to sleep with her blood sugar over 200, could she die in her sleep? She has been giving herself insulin based on the chart, but she hasn't been able to get her sugar below 200 so far, and she was terrified to go to sleep last night. Does high blood sugar like that just happen sometimes? Like you try your best to get the number down but it just doesn't happen right away? In the scheme of things, is temporarily having numbers in the 200-225 range an immediate threat if you're sleeping?
* Does anyone have any tips or "hacks"-- not like "short cuts" since this doesn't seem like the kind of thing where there are any, but more like "things you wish your doctors and the books had told you at the beginning."

<TITLE> Not eating to bring down blood sugar-- newly diagnosed with limited information from doctor </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-04-19 16:40:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello. One of my friends (30 years old) was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes two days ago and is *extremely* overwhelmed. I asked her if I could try to find some answers to some of her questions, so she knows I'm looking into this for her. Long story short: after being diagnosed 2 days ago and being sent home with limited information, she thinks that not eating for 10+ hours is necessary to bring down her sugar levels. Is that correct? She has other questions, but that's the one at the top of her mind.

 She has an appointment with a dietician next week, but during the diagnosis appointment a couple days ago, her endocrinologist basically just gave her a meter, some insulin, a chart for how much to administer based on blood sugar levels, and a pamphlet. My friend also came away with the impression that she shouldn't eat if her blood sugar is high. With her sugar over 200, she went over 10 hours without eating, and the number did not dip at all. She finally broke down and ate a small salad, after which her blood sugar went even higher. She's absolutely panicked now but acknowledges that "never eat again" is probably not the answer. Her doctor's  office hasn't been returning messages, so here I am on reddit for her (she's going to get a new endocrinologist after she gets the immediate situation under control). Here are the questions she asked me to look into:

<TITLE> Beginner with perennials— what do I do? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-04-03 14:11:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Last year, we moved into a home where the previous owners planted A LOT of perennials and took good care of them. We are absolute beginner gardeners and were overwhelmed with some life stuff last year and didn’t do much to the garden except pull weeds. I want to do better this year. I’ve looked up some resources and old posts here, but most of them seem oriented towards people starting a new garden, not people who inherited a good one that’s already up and running. Numerous amateur gardeners in the neighborhood have told us that the plants we have are essentially on “auto-pilot”— we have tons of hostas but also some other yet-to-be-identified things (we’ll work on that once they grow in).

What is the minimum we need to do to keep this beautiful garden thriving this year? Do you know of any resources targeted towards beginners who have inherited an already functioning garden? This year, the goal is “don’t kill it” and learn to take care of the plants we already have. I eventually want to be good at this though. I plan to really study up to do more in the future so we can do things like plant annuals— that just feels so overwhelming for this year, though. Thanks for any help you can provide.

Edit: Wow, thank you so much for all the detailed answers. This community feels so welcoming. This is seeming more and more like a hobby community I would like to be a part of, so I'd better study up! </TEXT>

<TITLE> A small success story- one less choosy beggar </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-03-15 00:17:25 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Today, I got my company to agree to pay its interns. I started out as an unpaid intern, and it sucked. I was lucky that I was able to afford it, but it still was tough. But I eventually graduated, got a job, and moved up the ranks into a managerial position. My company floated the idea of having interns, and a lot of upper management jumped on the idea as affordable labor for seasonal/special projects. Although they had reservations, since they had tried having unpaid interns in the past, and it did not work out well. I was brought into the conversation as the “millennial” in the room.

I immediately said that we needed to offer a salary, which was initially met with some resistance. But, over the months this was talked about, I was able to convince them that it was both in the interest of the interns and the interest of the company that we pay. Offering even a small salary to an undergraduate intern opens the internship up to everyone, and not just the people who can afford it, so we can choose from a wider and better pool of candidates. I also said that while the interns offer a benefit to the company, we needed to make sure they were getting actual training and exposure to the field. People didn’t really know what that meant, but I got them on board.

Our first paid intern is going to start soon. He will be helping us keep up with extra work that comes up this time of year and with special projects, many of which are great training. And he will have regular meet and greets with managers and upper level executives all over the company to learn what they do and network.

There is one less company being a choosy beggar now. If you feel like you can do it safely and you’re in a position in your company, don’t be afraid to propose actually paying your interns. You can be part of the solution of ending that nonsense practice. I hope this inspires someone to try. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My husband has used [Nivea Essentially Enriched Body Lotion for Dry to Very Dry Skin](https://www.ulta.com/essentially-enriched-body-lotion?productId=xlsImpprod5540059)  on his body for years. I've used it on and off as a hand cream as well,  and it has done wonders for my hands. Last week before bed, my face  just felt SO DRY even after my usual moisturizing routine that I just up and used some of his body lotion on my face. My face felt SO amazing, and the  moisturizing effect lasted well into the next day. I've been using it  nightly since then and there is such an enormous difference in my skin.  And the price is unbeatable-- you can buy 16 oz. for $7.99.

I admittedly have very dry skin, but... body lotion on my face? Is that insane? </TEXT>

My driveway is flat, and I have snow tires, so it’s not a problem at all as far as I can tell.

<TITLE> I’m having compassion fatigue toward a friend who got a diagnosis of Aspergers last year and has had emotional issues since then </TITLE>
<DATE> 2018-11-26 16:36:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> TLDR; One of my friends has been having significant emotional issues for over a year after she got a diagnosis of Aspergers. The feel like she’s been using the diagnosis as a reason to not try to be a good friend anymore.

One of my friends is a 33F. We’ve been friends since high school. She’s always been a bit unique when it comes to social interactions— she missed certain social cues and was a bit “naive” about relationships (her word). She is pretty exuberant/enthusiastic about her friendships/relationships— some people would describe her as “a lot.” That always got her in trouble with relationships, as she’d go in WAY harder than the guy she was interested in or dating, but I always appreciated how that quality came out in our friendship. She’s been a good friend— if she’s your friend, you know it, and in these days of looser connections, that’s awesome. All that being said, she’s always seemed to have issues navigating social situations, particularly after she entered the working world and had to navigate workplace relationships. She’s always had pretty severe anxiety/OCD (like the intrusive thoughts kind), and she’s had bouts with depression. Finally, last year she was diagnosed with Aspergers, which made a lot in her life make sense. Around the same time, she lost her job, and between that and this new information about how her mind works, she went into a tailspin. I ended up helping her check into an inpatient psych ward last December. She’s been unable to hold down a job, and she’s had major emotional issues since then.

I’m happy she finally had an answer— I have my own significant experience with having an undiagnosed condition and know how hard it is to feel like something is “wrong” but not know what. However, it’s been over a year, and it seems like she’s now using the diagnosis as an excuse to not try with people anymore. I know no one can try all the time, particularly when they are dealing with major life issues. However, over the last year, she ONLY contacts me when she needs to “vent.” And then it’s an hour or two of listening to how everyone in her life is treating her badly— there is some truth to that when it comes to her family, to be fair. But she never, ever contacts me when things are going well. I reach out to her, and we’ll get together, and it’s just all the same— I listen to her problems, try to offer some advice, etc. She never reciprocates anymore in almost any way— for example, I bought my first house, she came over “to vent,” walked in, sat on the new couch, and didn’t ask or say anything about the house. She expressed no interest in seeing it at all... the girl I knew before a year ago, before her diagnosis would have.

She also has always disliked kids, but now she’s almost outright hostile about (not toward) them. She says it has something to do with her Aspergers, “because they are hard to read” — like, just their presence in a restaurant irritates her to the extreme, even when they are behaving. Most of our mutual friends have had kids and can’t be around her anymore, because who wants to be around someone who you feel like hates your kid for existing, especially when they have to have their babies with them 99% of the time when they are still breastfeeding/the primary caretaker? She also doesn’t seem to want to be around them now that they have kids, either. But my partner and I want to start trying for a baby in a year or two, and I feel like this has basically put an expiration date on our friendship.

On top of just what I feel is normal compassion fatigue, I’ve been dealing with my own diagnosed anxiety and depression. I mentioned it to her once, and she didn’t really respond to it and just started in on her own issues. It’s just getting hard for me to be friends with her, because the thought of seeing her and listening to more problems makes me feel a little anxious and irritated/annoyed, which I feel terrible about, because her mental health issues are real and hard for her. It’s gotten to the point where she texted me asking to meet up so she could vent, and I just said “sorry, I’m out of town all weekend.” I was.... at my grandmother’s funeral. I just didn’t see the point in telling her that part, and I then realized there is something not right in our friendship.

I just don’t know what to do or say to her without being an asshole. Or am I already doing something wrong? Any perspective on this would be appreciated.

Edit: she has a therapist she sees weekly. It seems like she calls me when she has a few days before her next appointment.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe this is a bad idea for some reason I’m missing, but I’d find it helpful if when producers posted a link to their new episodes, they included a text post or comment with a synopsis of what their podcast overall is about. I see a lot of “new episode alert” posts here that are oriented towards current subscribers, but not new/potential ones. People simply post something like “New Episode of X podcast!” but if it’s a show I’ve never heard of before, I have no idea what the podcast is about as a whole or if it’s something I’m interested in. It would be great to not have to leave reddit to go find a synopsis, and it would make it easier/more likely for me to subscribe.

As an aside, thanks to all the creators here for all the fabulous entertainment, and thanks to everyone for all the suggestions! I’ve found so many great shows already here, and I’m looking forward to more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm a guest, not a FD worker. I've enjoyed this sub and hope it makes me a better guest (although TBH I can't imagine doing most of the stuff you all share... there are some crazy people out there). But I wanted to share a story about a some awesome FD employees that dealt with a terrible situation beautifully.

So I'm staying in a decent, but not \*super\* high-end, chain hotel with my mom, my grandmother, and great-aunt. The latter two are sisters, and both disabled and have lost their hearing due to age. However, they can hear... sort of... with hearing aids, which they take out at night (important later). My grandmother uses a walker and her sister is in a wheelchair. They both need disabled rooms with the extra room, safer showers, etc. Since they don't get to see each other often, they stayed in a room together. My mom and I were in a nearby room. When we arrived, the lobby was busy-- it seems that there was a wedding staying there, because their venue was just across the street. But we get checked in, and everything is great Grandma and great-aunt settle into their disabled room, and we all go to sleep. It's all fine.

Then at 6AM, we are woken up by the BEEP BEEP BEEP of the fire alarm. Oh crap. We are going to have to go wake grandma and great-aunt, because they won't hear the fire alarm without their hearing aids in. We run out the door to go wake them. We use our key to get in and start getting them into their wheelchair/heading towards the door. It's slow going. It had only been a couple minutes since the alarm started-- we didn't even have them fully out of bed yet when we hear a pounding on the door. Neither my mom nor I can get to the door because we are both supporting the weight of an old lady trying to get them out of bed. After a minute, we hear a "I'm coming in!" and a hotel employee pokes their head in. They say "Oh, good, you're helping them. There was a note that they were elderly and disabled, and I wanted to make sure they were able to evacuate." She ran off, since I'm sure her to-do list had just grown exponentially and was growing by the second, but I thought her concern during all the chaos was wonderful.

But WAIT it's not over! So we finally get them out the door and hang around for a while. FD employee comes and finds us and tells us what happened: a guest on the third floor ignored the "do not hang anything on the sprinkler" sign and, you guessed it, hung a suit on the sprinkler. This pulled the sprinkler out of the ceiling and pulled the water pipe down along with it. The pressure from the water then further busted the pipe, and the it was slowly splitting all the way down the hallway. All the rooms on the 1st and 2nd floors on that side of the hotel were either already flooded or about to be. FD employee tells us that our rooms are currently dry but not for long. They are safe to enter, so my mom and I run in and pack everyone's things.

We go to the lobby to find the whole place in less chaos than we expected, because the FD told everyone to go grab some breakfast in the breakfast room, and they would come grab people to work on rooms/refunds/etc. I thought that was a really smart way to manage it. So, after a bit they come and find us, and tell us that we are all taken care of-- they have moved my grandmother/aunt to another disabled room and found my mother and me a room very close to it. They dropped off our keys at our table-- we didn't even have to go to the desk and continued to enjoy our waffles.

There weren't enough dry/safe rooms to re-room everyone in the hotel, but they got this solved too. They arranged to move the entire wedding party to a sister property a couple of miles away that was a MUCH nicer hotel. The next day, at breakfast I was talking to one of the wedding guests who remained in our hotel, and apparently some of the guests who were moved to the nicer hotel didn't just get to stay in a nicer hotel-- the bride/groom, their parents, and grandparents all got moved to the super nice multi-room suites. We found out that the new disabled room my grandmother and great aunt got originally belonged to one of the wedding's grandparents-- the FD really did some room shuffling in record time! The hotel also managed to hired a limo (not just a car or a van; a limo) to transport the wedding party to and from their new hotel to their venue, since they were originally close enough to walk. I figure that most hotels/FD workers wouldn't usually be able to manage something like this whole last part, since it depended on having a nearby sister property, open rooms, and a flexible corporate policy. But I thought it was cool that the hotel employees clearly spent some time thinking creatively and went to the time and effort to do to go above and beyond when they could have just handed out empty rooms first-come-first-serve and told the overflow people "Here are directions to your new hotel," which is probably the best solution I would have been able to come up with.

I was just blown away by how well the FD handled the situation. I swear I probably would have been running around screaming "Run for your lives! We're all going to drown!" But they managed to pay attention to details like "there are disabled old people in this room" during a crisis they didn't cause, and they saved a wedding to boot-- they may have made it even better than it was originally! It's probably the most impressive customer service I've seen in any situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not my JNMIL, but a family friend's. The cast: 1) The JNMIL who we will call Insensitive Bitch (IB); 2) Her daughter, the bride; 3) The groom, my family friend; 4) The groom's mother, who we'll call Diane.

I could post a novel about the shenanigans surrounding this wedding and its planning, because most of the players have some crazy going on. But I'll keep it to the ones that focus on JNMIL.

The bride and IB are THE most stereotypical Southern Belle family I've ever seen. Everything was about marrying into the "right" family and to a man who had a "future." To emphasize how money-grubbing they were, a quick tangent: they found out from Diane that I was dating a doctor at the time, because she kindly looked into whether I would want a last-minute plus one since she knew I was getting serious with my boyfriend and someone else couldn't make it to the wedding. I didn't want a plus one, since I had only been with him for six months, but it was nice of her to ask. She's sweet like that. Anyway, bride has only \*very\* casually spoken with me 2-3 times over the past 5 years, and her mother had NEVER MET ME. During the rehearsal dinner, they both at different times came up to me, and I had basically the same conversation both times: "You're dating a DOCTOR?! You HAVE to marry him." Me: "We haven't been together that long." Them: "Well you can't let a DOCTOR go. Stick with him. The financial security is worth it." IB apparently also went up to my my MOTHER (also at the wedding) and told her "Don't let your daughter let a doctor get away." My mom is JustYes and was like "...not my business." They didn't know me or anything about the guy at all other than his profession. He could have been a horrible person, for all they knew. He could have kicked puppies-- they didn't know a single thing! Anyway, that's the sort of superficial and tactless people the bride and her mother, IB are.

Anyway, during the early planning stages of the wedding, Diane found out that she had late stage breast cancer. For a while, the doctors really weren't sure if she would make it through treatment.  I don't remember the exact timeline, but after a month or so, it became clear that she \*would\* make it, but she was still facing months of chemo and radiation. Because of all this, though, Diane did not participate in wedding planning very much. She couldn't even get out of bed most days much less attend flower appointments or a wedding planning trip to IB's house in Southern City.

While Diane is still getting chemo treatments, after a few months, IB and the bride confront the groom, saying they didn't think Diane was "pulling her weight." Remember, until recently the groom thought his mother was going to die. I just got the replay of the conversation, but IB apparently took the lead on the it, saying things like, "Well I understand that they thought she was going to die BEFORE, but she's better now and can help. Even if \*I\* was dying, I would use my last days to make my child's wedding the best it could be." Also: "Well as I understand it, she doesn't get chemo every day. Surely she could take a couple of days to fly to Southern City to join us for a wedding planning weekend." Lady, she STILL HAS CANCER. The groom, to his credit, almost left his future wife over that conversation. He moved out and everything. But, they got back together.

To top all of this off, a week before the wedding, the groom’s paternal grandfather dies, so he and his whole family has to fly to the funeral and then to the Destination Wedding City for the wedding. Because of this, none of them can pick up bags of candy from a vendor in his family's city before driving to the destination wedding city (he, his future wife, and his family all now live in one city; IB lives in Southern City, where the bride is originally from; they are getting married in a 3rd Destination Wedding City). The bags of candy were just one component going into the guest goody bags. In other words: NOT THAT IMPORTANT. And also, the groom arranged for one of his friends to get candy bags and bring them. They arrived on time! It was fine! When IB found out that the groom’s family had passed along their responsibility for candy bags due to a death in the family (she knew about the death, and that someone else was getting the candy), she called Diane and complained that it was unacceptable for her to not even do this one small thing since they hadn't done anything else to help plan. Diane, meanwhile, is saying goodbye to her JustYes FIL who she'd known and loved since she'd married into the family decades before and and also trying to comfort her husband, who had just lost his dad. And, remember, she had just recently recovered from cancer-- I mean, less than an inch of her hair had grown back; that's how recent it was. In other words, she did not need this crazy woman's extra emotional baggage about a non-existent problem.

The night before the wedding, IB found Diane and basically said that based on her "performance" for this wedding, Diane would do a bad job on her own daughter's wedding when the time came (the groom’s younger sister who was not even in a relationship). She made Diane cry on the night before her son's wedding. The wedding managed to happen despite this and other insanity. IB showed up in a SUPER low-cut and tight evening gown with jewels and sequins all over it. It was the same EXACT color, not even a shade different, but much, MUCH flashier than the bridesmaid's dresses. She looked like she was the maid of honor! The last ridiculous thing I heard her say was her telling the the groom’s brother's fiance that she should "take notes, but don't copy this wedding. We worked too hard on it, and your engagement ring is already too similar to the my daughter’s."

It's a couple years later, and while the bride and groom don't seem to be the most functional, happiest couple on earth, they now seem to be getting along better now that the wedding is over. I hope this woman stays well out of their lives, but it seems like that probably won't happen. </TEXT>
