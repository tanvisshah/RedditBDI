<TEXT> Thank you for sharing some of your story. It takes a lot of courage to do so.

I'm not trying to shun people with mental illnesses into hiding. I was diagnosed with bulimia and bipolar disorder a little while ago, and hearing of others experiences or people sharing their stories to break the stigma is so uplifting.

I've always thought 'coming out' was a term exclusive to the LGBTQ+ community and I guess I've just been seeing it pop up more outside of the queer community which has confused me a little, the same as a lot of other queer terminology. But that's just my experience, and I can totally see why people would want to also disclose other parts of their identity using similar language. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We love an ally!

The term queer has been historically aligned with people that are not cis-gendered or heterosexual. If you identify with both of those then you wouldn't be considered queer.

This term has a lot of pain and liberation connected to it, and myself and many other lgbtq+ people have a strong reaction to it. If someone uses the term queer outside of this understanding, I would personally feel pretty silenced and ignored.

This is just my opinion, and I can't stress how thankful I am that you have resonated with and supported the queer community to the extent you have! </TEXT>

It won't suck forever. You'll move away and realise you're not alone and there are people out there that will love and support you unconditionally. Until then; consume queer media, write shit down, explore your sexuality safely, come out to a friend or two, make use of lgbtq+ spaces online (the wholesome ones), and remember that you are so much more than the people around you and their opinions of you.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Is This Psychosis? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-10-03 16:07:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was diagnosed with bipolar II earlier this year despite potential psychotic symptoms. My psych never explained my diagnosis even after telling him about this. I'm wondering if anyone with type 1 or type 2 can relate/ I'm curious of type 1 manic experiences.

Mania:

My most recent manic episode I thought I could see people's auras and predict the future. I spent over $3000 on an impulsive trip to several European countries. This left massive financial consequences for my broke college student ass. I frequently went days without sleeping, otherwise I sleeping <6 hours on average. I blew up at a few friends and strangers because of my irritability. I was still able to perform daily functioning and my delusions were largely kept to myself.

 I experienced one auditory hallucination about 5 years ago which was probably due to starvation (ED).

Depression:

I usually think people are conspiring against me. Believing spiritual or supernatural things are trying to harm me. Recently I  saw moving shadows around my room briefly for a few hours.

&#x200B;

I am mainly just confused when people say that type 2 is 'less severe' or hypomania is just feeling great when my experience doesn't feel like that. Hypomania has some great moments, but my episodes are very destructive leaving severe financial and personal consequences.

I'm interested to see what anyone else thinks? </TEXT>

<TEXT> silent practise can be just as useful as making sound!
- Try listening to your piece whilst playing you sax without a mouthpiece.
- Try just doing the fingerings of tricky passages until they feel fluent to build that muscle memory
- Going to your sheet music and write helpful markings you forget to write down when practising; rhythms, articulation, improv notes, breath marks, phrasing, dynamics, piano or accompaniment short scoring/ queues etc!
- Find new music to play.
- Taking time to rest away from your instrument is also important in not getting burnt out

These are just some things I like to do!
Good luck, I hope your recovery goes well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just read something that described mania in terms of **hypermania meaning completely manic, and hypomania meaning slightly manic**. Both are still **mania** and manic episodes.

Until this point I've always felt weird about having BP2 because I felt like I was somehow less severe (therefore needing less help) than someone with BP1 because we don't experience 'mania'. But my hypomanic episodes have been the most destructive periods of my life (they've also had some joyous moments), and I have been able to relate to so many people with BP1, however I have never had to be hospitalised for my mania and even when experiencing delusions I have never felt completely disconnected with reality whilst manic.

I was diagnosed earlier this year and I have done so much research but never found something so impactful as this random comment I found on a subreddit. I hope this helps someone else as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Here are just some I‚Äôve noted along the way.

Please Like Me: Rose. The main character‚Äôs Mum really captured the pain, funny bits, and utter devastation of bipolar. I‚Äôve also never seen a more accurate portrayal of MDD than in the character Hannah. TW.

Silver Linings Playbook: Pat. There we‚Äôre definitely bits that were over dramatised and unrealistic, but I saw myself in Pat so much it rendered me speechless and was the first time I considered I might have bp before I was diagnosed.

Euphoria: Rue Bennett. I haven‚Äôt seen it, and not sure I want to. It seems to glorify bipolar and mania. The fanbase seems to find bipolar trendy, but apparently it portrays it well.

Skam (norway): Evan. Watched this way before I was diagnosed. The manic scene might be a bit extreme but it showed the importance of support and understanding. It‚Äôs also very cute.

Infinitely Polar Bear: Cameron. I haven‚Äôt seen it and I‚Äôm just preparing myself before I do. It seems like it really captures bipolar parenting accurately. The happiness the pain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd consider him questioning or bisexual. If a gay man on occasion willingly sought out and enjoyed having sex with women, I would consider him bisexual.

Probably because I've never experienced it but I just can't get in the mind-frame of a straight guy seeking gay sex and considering him self straight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> oh my goodness. ignore the typos, I'm writing this with tears in my eyes. You madam are simply the best.

There are going to be things you don't know that she also doesn't know, but part of growing up is learning that stuff, and part of being a parent to an LGBTQ+ child is offering support and safety along the way. Coming out is the beginning of someone journey, not the end of it.

Sex:

You don't have to be the one to show her methods of safe sex or discuss sex in detail with her, no child enjoys that! But telling her that she should follow safe sex with a man or a woman, and that there are resources online available for that is an important conversation to have, since she probably won't learn about gay safe sex in school. Also talking to her about consent is important too.

Support:

I didn't have a supportive reaction from my mother when I came out. However she came around after a few years and now we are close again. The most impactful thing my mother has ever done for my little gay heart was asking "would you like to watch 'love simon' (a high school gay romance movie) with me". We watched it in silence, and didn't speak afterwards. But that is possibly the most impactful moment of my life. Initiating a desire to watch or listen to gay media will make your daughter feel so appreciated. Showing interest in general, "that girl is cute!" "did you know Drew Barrymore is bisexual too?" She might be embarrassed, but she will feel normal, and it will become less awkward and allow her to discuss it openly with you as well. Educate yourself as well on the LGBTQ+ issues, definitions, advice forums (you're doing great at this already <3) .

Concerns:

Unfortunately LGBTQ+ individuals are 2.5 more likely to suffer a mental health crisis compared to cisgendered heterosexuals. Bisexual and gay women are twice as likely to experience substance abuse issues in comparison to heterosexual women. This is something that is rampant within the community and it will be important to monitor this closely. Even in the most supportive home environment, it is difficult to feel supported in a world that wasn't designed for you.

She will still go through the normal stages of life, she will have other issues and concerns, and being bisexual is just a part of who she is it doesn't define her.

You:

Because of her coming out you are going to notice things in the world around you, you may notice more of the microagressions and homophobia in the world and it may be difficult knowing you can't protect her from everything. Just know that you don't have to be perfect, and it's okay if at times it is overwhelming for you. You are not being selfish for feeling the emotions you are feeling now and in the future, but you have a new responsibility to your daughter now and you will need to love her so deeply she will never forget how amazing and valued she is. I wish you the best of luck, and a part of me is jealous but so excited you and your daughter get to experience something the majority of LGBTQ+ people never have or will. You are amazing. Your daughter is amazing. <3 </TEXT>

Keep your throat open (similar to your throat position in a yawn) and think about engaging the top like a bit more, if you throw in a lot of ab support you'll be able to hit the note without any drama!

Don't worry about the staccato or dynamics for now, get comfortable resonating the note at any dynamic and with a full sound. You can always go back and perfect the markings later!

<TEXT> This is not your fault. Whatever you're feeling right now is valid and justified, but just know that this was a reflection of everything good in you and everything bad in the other person. You shouldn't feel ashamed for being kind and trusting, these are good qualities they were just abused in this situation.

I was catfished and I didn't see red flags as red flags until a long time afterwards. It's easy for others to tell you things were red flags or you should have known when they didn't experience what you experienced in the environment you did.

This is a lesson. It will guide you though life and is so valuable yet not many learn it. There are genuine people out there, and your good qualities are still good. You are still an individual who is strong, amazing and is worthy of genuine connection.

My heart breaks for you but is excited that you get to move on to better things in your life. Good luck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A teacher can walk you through the basics, but it might be good to check out some 'saxophone fingering' videos on youtube just to remind you of how the instrument works!

In the beginning of learning, and picking an instrument up again, it will feel really slow and it might be overwhelming, but I promise after the first month things will really change and everything gets so much easier! You'll be performing in no time! You've just got to keep it up, and having a scheduled weekly or biweekly lesson with a teacher can help with that motivation :)

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't seen it being romanticised as much as other mental illnesses (like eating disorders), but I think it probably still exists. The whole Kanye West situation didn't help.

I think there has to be a healthy balance between media portraying bipolar as a serious illness, ie: mania can be very destructive and isn't just a quirky creative phase, with  depression also being a serious part of the illness. Whilst also showing that people with bipolar are just like everyone else and can live healthy and stable lives too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for posting!

Even the most progressive countries have people who have experienced horrific treatment for being lgbtq+. And attending pride for those people can be incredible healing. Even those who have grown up in a supportive environment will surely feel some sort of liberation attending pride.

But also we can't forget that Pride isn't just for that city or country. When I was younger I would look at photos and videos from Pride events around the USA (I'm not American) and it would make me feel less alone and as though one day I could be who I am authentically.

Just because you think it isn't necessary, doesn't mean that it isn't necessary for others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally. Even in progressive countries there is still a lot of homophobia and danger for lgbtq people. I grew up in a small town in Australia, I've received threats, my gay femme friend has been attacked and chased on foot and in vehicles (we are both 20-21). And the normal gay slurs and religious people trying to give us interventions. A girl at my religious high school was kicked out after the principal interrogated her about her sexuality (a year or two before my friend and I were there).

Yet somehow being gay is now 'becoming popular' as the straights like to say. </TEXT>

All of my close friends rarely had their 21st party on the day they turned 21 - they would save it for a weekend or an upcoming event.

When you can, I'd talk to your doc and see what they say about being off of meds right now since it sounds like it might be a bit of a difficult time ahead.

<TEXT> Mixed episodes can appear in lots of different ways.

For me they feel like I have a million things I want to do, but I physically don't even have the energy to get out of bed and shower. It feels like I'm going insane a little to the point it physically hurts when I'm like this. It can look like severe boredom as well, doing lots of things but nothing gives me any entertainment, or being so bored and yet I don't want to do anything. Sometimes I can have bursts of energy followed by severe lows all within about 10 minutes. When I'm like this it feels like my brain is about to split in two and I get really aggressive because I don't understand whats going on and I can't stop it.

My mixed episodes don't last for long, at most they're a week long, but usually it's a day or two before a major episode. </TEXT>

<TEXT> studies have shown a connection between genetics and bipolar.

If you note obvious periods of low and then elevated moods in your mum  (lasting from weeks or months, years), then I'd consider looking deeper into the diagnostic criteria of bipolar, or better yet asking her to see a GP for a psychical and mental health check and they might be able to refer your mum to a psychiatrist. That's if she's willing, which usually isn't the case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you're undiagnosed - talk to a GP first and they will assess your physical health (lots of things can cause mood abnormalities), then they will refer you or you can ask to be referred to a psychiatrist who specialises in mood disorders (usually). A psychiatrist can then recommend a psychologist - some doctors also do this.

If you're diagnosed looking for a second opinion/ additional help, talk to whatever professional you've been seeing (GP, psychiatrist or psychologist) and they'll be more than happy to help!

Also you definitely want someone who specialises in mood disorders if you can! </TEXT>

I got referred to a psych earlier this year (I'm 20) after seeing a doctor about what I thought was something else. Both my doctor and my psych told me I have bipolar but it wasn't until recently I've started believing it. I still go through moments of thinking it's just all in my head - despite obvious history with depression and hypo/mania.

&#x200B;

Talk to your therapist and see what they think about potentially being bipolar, and getting referred to a psychiatrist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some people will take a while to understand. Especially people really close to us - they have to say goodbye to the life they thought you would live and get to know the authentic you.

 If you are in high school, or younger, chances are you are the first gay person the people around you have ever met. People don't hear lgbtq+ people talk about their sexuality/ identity/ sex very much because we are a minority, so naturally when we talk about it cic/straight people think we're obsessed because they're hearing it 100% more than before you came out.

My biggest advice is to take this time to celebrate and love yourself. You get to be your own person and you don't have to hide anymore. Explore your sexuality and self expression. Research, ask questions, explore, but most importantly be safe!

Also know that it might feel like your sexuality is a massive part of your identity right now, partly because society treats it like it is, but there is so much more to you than your sexuality. Don't feel like you have to talk about your sexuality all the time, or feel like you have to come out to people if you don't want to, don't feel like you have to sleep with lots of guys, don't feel like you have to dress or act a certain way. Feel free to do that if you want, but there is so much more to you than that.

Coming out is the first step to uncovering who you are, it isn't the final step. Being in the closet surpasses so much more than just your sexuality. This unlocks so many more doors, it's just the beginning of your journey and I'm excited for you! </TEXT>

Good luck, college is hard enough without bipolar, the fact you managed to try again is in itself amazing and not many people would have even considered that.

I'd also like to live the dream of my younger self and all those who came before me who thought they could never get married or live a 'normal' life as a queer person. I'd like to honour all those who died and would have died to see a day when two men could get married.

When it was legalised in Australia (2017) it marked the first moment in my life I felt as though I could live a normal life with someone I loved in the future - and I'd like to think that'll happen one day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sexuality is a weird thing, it's completely normal to have lots going on in your head.

Just so you know, you can be impressionable and not be straight (I know you weren't implying that you can't but it may help to know that after coming out I feel a lot more confident in myself which makes me a lot more impressionable in my professional and personal life).

I'm sorry your exes reacted the way they did, just know that there are lots of women out there that wouldn't care and the fact that they reacted negatively has everything to do with them and nothing to do with you. Some might find it more attractive and mature to have a deeper understanding of themselves and their sexuality.

Feel free to keep asking questions and venting whatever is on your mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We're all individuals who happen to share an identity it doesn't mean all have the same experience with our identity.

If you are/were sexually and romantically attracted to females, chances are you aren't gay, but maybe bisexual if you are sexually/ romantically attracted to men also.

Internalised homophobia can cause a lot of anxiety and really skew the way we think about our sexuality (hence why a lot of homophobic bullies turn out to actually be a lil' gay). So if you can imagine a world without LGBTQ+ stigma and you imagine yourself being happy with a man, the same as you can be happy with a women, then you might be bisexual.

<TEXT> That must be really exhausting. I'd encourage talking to your doctors about this. Some people with ultradian bipolar might experience such quick mood swings, but it's pretty rare with bipolar outside of mixed episodes. From what I've gathered from others and my own experience being diagnosed, it seems more common for episodes to last several months. I can't even imagine how frustrating it would be to cycle more frequently than that.

Alternatively, my friend has borderline personality disorder and some of her symptoms sound similar to this. But once again, check with your doctors <3 </TEXT>

That's how things ideally will happen. This process can take a few days, or maybe a few weeks/ months. But it's worth it in the end. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I'm in my 3rd year of university (in Australia) and have diagnosed bipolar 2, and a problematic history with food.

\-Anxiety-

University can be really intimidating, even without the added stress of mental health struggles. Some of your anxiety is natural, and everyone else is experiencing that as well. And some of that anxiety is unique to your circumstance and is completely valid. One thing that helped me was decorating my room as soon as I got there, it helps feel more safe and personalised. It's also really scary meeting new people in a new environment, but everyone else is feeling the exact same way and is jus waiting for someone else to talk to them - so try being that person or being open for someone to talk to you. That's how I met my best friends and we still live together.

\-Food-

Living at a residential college has been so great for me in terms of maintaining a healthy and regular daily schedule. Nutrition is super important for the brain and the body, and I don‚Äôt have to think about it at college compared to when I‚Äôm at home. Meal times are also the exact same time every day which helps keep a daily routine going. Because the meals are already made, it means that when I‚Äôm in a depressive episode, if I can bring myself to the dining hall, I can eat a nutritious meal, and if I‚Äôm hypo/manic I know eating won‚Äôt take as much time as it normally would so I tend to continue eating even when I feel like I‚Äôm too busy to eat.

But also I‚Äôve found that I still get some intrusive thoughts at meal times, but it has helped me so much to have my friends go to meals with me and distract me whilst we talk about random things. I forget about the food and the thoughts. I‚Äôm thankful that the worst of my ED was a few years ago now, but this supportive format has really helped me.

\-Support-

I feel the most supported I‚Äôve ever felt being at college. I live surrounded by friends who are there for me to go to when things are difficult, or are there to make sure I‚Äôm about to do something stupid when hypo/manic. My college also has a really great student support team that are trained in helping mental health situations. I also have access to the counselling/ doctor services at my university. I also have my private doctors and psychiatrists that I go to, but I like that the other options are still there.

\-Independence-

It‚Äôs scary having to be more independent but it has been so refreshing for me. In good ways and bad. I feel a lot more secure in who I am as a person now that I control my life. Once you‚Äôre at uni, you‚Äôll be able to see what units you like more and what you choose to study may change. None of my friends have continued to study what they initially entered in 3 years ago, and are loving what they‚Äôre doing now. It‚Äôs your life, you make the rules and sometimes you suffer the consequences only to learn for the future.

Good luck, and let me know if you have any questions. College is an amazing experience, and there‚Äôs naturally going to be some bumps along the way but we‚Äôll get through it. </TEXT>

Sometimes you don't need to douche, you can just tell you're good. If you do douche, don't use too much water, you really just need to clean the rectum, not the entire colon. I use lukewarm water. You can buy an enema, or get creative. For my first time I just used a water bottle lol. I usually douche 2-3 times. Wait a solid 30 minutes after douching before sex.

2.

Lube is amazing. Being relaxed/ breathing and not stressed is also great for loosening up, but also foreplay is great. Also lots of lube. Both on the dick and on the hole.

3.

I use a trimmer without the guard. Less ingrown hairs/ razor bumps and itchiness. But if you have to shave, try using a mirror. At the very least use your free hand to 'see' where the blade is going. I cover my butthole with my finger when trimming or shaving because if you cut or trim that. My god.

&#x200B;

I was really anxious before my first time as well, but I got really lucky and I was with someone I trusted and who had experience and new to take it slow. Make sure to voice your concerns and remember that consent is everything. Tell him if it doesn't feel okay. Tell him if you change your mind. Porn isn't realistic. If it hurts stop. Also air might escape during sex and it might be embarrassing but it happens all the time so just laugh it off or ignore it. Remember that you're giving him something, he isn't taking anything from you.

Good luck! (it'll be okay) </TEXT>

<TEXT> PS: This is a long answer and I've now levelled up to 5am so bear with me xD

You raise some really good points in a very respective way! I think in a world where gender norms didn't exist, then yeah, terms like gay or straight might not be so useful as current genders exist with the reference being the gender norm. So in that world, essentially gender wouldn't exist either as it functions for the purpose of multiple sexualities.

However given that we don't live in that society, I think there are a few issues with this ideology. Whilst sometimes labels can seem complicated and overabundant, labels inevitably help a lot of people with accessibility. A quick example is the LGBTQ+ 'genre' on netflix, it's not to segregate queer film, it's to make it easier to access especially for queer people who want to consume something that is reflective of themselves and not have to seed through the millions of films that don't concern them.

On this as well, dating as a queer person is already hard enough WITH labels. The current possibility of asking "hey are you gay?" etc answers and implies soo much helpful information. I couldn't imagine how difficult it would be as a traditionally straight or traditionally gay person to date in a world where the only sexuality is pansexuality with varying personal biases. For example rather than asking someone their sexuality, you might have to ask things like "hey, are you sexually attracted to masculinity, and on top of that the male genitalia, also what pronouns do you use, and are you attracted to dating someone with the same pronouns" and once you've got that out the way, then you'd have to figure out if they're a top, bottom, or verse. And although it's more inclusive and specific, currently everything besides a preferred sexual role is implied when dating as a gay person.

But also, erasing sexualities erases gender. And for some it's pretty important that their sexuality reflects their gender. For example, some cultures around the world don't discern the difference between gay men and transgender women, which is unfortunate as they are completely different experiences and in combining the two it erases them both. For example if I were to be in a relationship I  would feel uncomfortable if it were labeled anything besides a gay relationship, because I am a man and I am sexually attracted to other male identifying people. Or if my partner didn't recognise our relationship as a gay relationship (regardless if they were pansexual, bisexual etc), I would feel uncomfortable that my partner might be attracted to me not because of my gender which plays a large role in my life, as I will never claim to be or understand the experience of women. Given some gay people might enjoy the fantasy, I've been with guys that called me their girl, or their bitch, or compared me to the likeness of women/ their genitalia, and I feel very uncomfortable with that.

In this is also the concern that many transgender people might feel a bit forgotten. I suspect a lot of transgender people are empowered when their sexuality reveals and reflects their true gender and documents that change. There are also transgender people that have no desire for their sexuality to focus on their gender either, and that is also valid.

Another side note: trying to hit on a straight guy without realising he's not attracted to your gender can be very dangerous in todays society, so if pansexuality were the only sexuality there would have to be a new elaborate way to say "gay bar" or "gay safe space" etc. However I assume in a more progressive world where your concept might be applicable, this wouldn't be a risk.

 This isn't to say that current pansexuals are erasing genders, their very sexuality defines the inclusiveness of all genders. However people that are not sexually attracted to some genders, or wish to be attracted to regarding a specific gender, are ignored in this label.  Eg, a man who is not attracted to other genders besides male, and a binary-identifying person wanting their sexuality label to explain their gender identity.

At the end of the day, I think (helpful) labels make us diverse and I enjoy belonging to a community that can generally relate to my specific experience. I think a world without labels has no diversity and that is not a world I am very interested in being a part of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 20 is an age where people are usually mid way through college, partying and pretty naive. 30 is often believed to be a time of financial stability (at least compared to their 20 year old self), and they might be considering starting a family. This isn't the rule, this is just the popular opinion. But 30 and 40 appear closer than 20 and 30, so it probably wouldn't  turn as many heads as the latter.

If you turn it the other way, imagine a 10 year old dating a 20 year old. First of all it's illegal, but also there was probably a visceral reaction when you read that right?

Society has a perception about when a larger age gap is appropriate and when it seems a bit unlikely based on the preconceived ideas of what people are like at certain ages in life.

<TEXT> there's so much tradition behind drag shows. For a lot of queens it was a way of exploring their gender identity in a safe space, and a lot of the queens identified as transgender (or a different term more popular at the time) at least in Australia during the 1960s. So it was quite liberating for trans women.

Another counter argument is the fact that a lot of queens aim to show the absurdity of gender constructs and deliberately aim to portray how qualities used to pressure women are nothing more than performative and irrational. In some ways it highlights the issue of toxic masculinity on feminine people, and gives space to liberate feminism.

But just as transphobia has always existed in the gay community, it has unfortunately also existed in the drag community and in some areas it has fostered a space for gay men to exclude cis and trans women, verging away from the traditional values of drag.

&#x200B;

That's just my opinion though! There's a lot of prose about drag in terms of feminism out there though, i'd highly encourage looking into it. I'm not a drag queen, or a women so I'm just speaking from a particular consumer's point of view. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're so right.

I also agree, I think conformity is a form of self harm. People are going to give you shit whether you conform or not so you may as well just do whats comfortable to you (if safe to do so).

In regards to wearing makeup, experimenting is the only way you will find whats comfortable! I wear a bb cream, and for me that makes me feel confident and not self conscious I will get clocked. There are also natural male makeup styles that are popular around the world.

People tend to be less likely to call someone out if they're confident in their expression. Wearing makeup isn't a timid act as a man, it's a bold statement upon which people can only try and feed off your insecurities, so if you're confident and you're wearing makeup, you are the most powerful person on earth. Physical harassment is different however. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That is a doosey to read at 3am. I think at the end of the day to be a heterosexual male is to be attracted to people that identify with being a woman/ feminine identifying people.

Whereas identifying as a homosexual man, in my case, I see it as being attracted to people that identify as male or masculine identifying. For this reason I would never date a trans woman, because I am not attracted to women regardless of their genitalia. This is the same reason that I am attracted to trans men, because I am attracted to men and people that identify with being male regardless again of genitalia.

Someone who is pansexual or bisexual can see the attraction in both groups of people. Those that identify with being masculine or male, and those that identify with being feminine or female.

I think rather than thinking of everyone as potential pansexual, think of sexuality as a spectrum upon which many people exist at different points and sometimes fluctuate.

Note: Preferences play a large role in sexuality. Some people have a sexual infinity for certain genitalia. As well as varying attractions towards femininity and masculinity. For this reason just because I am attracted to men, doesn't mean I'm attracted to all men. The same is probably true for straight people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Happy Pride!

I think you're onto something when you say it's complex. Straight passing is definitely a privilege in the sense that they won't be discriminated against on face value. But at the same time the feeling of having your sexuality insulted whilst you're in the room/ in conversation is a pain that only queer people will ever understand, and to a greater extent straight passing people will experience that more often. However the safety and identity of non-passing people is jeopardised in ways not experienced by straight/cis passing people.

I'm someone who moves pretty fluidly between passing and not passing. I've been called fa\* several times by strangers in the street, threatened, tokenised by friends and my current employer, as well as avoided and ignored when I've displayed "feminine" behaviour and dressed less "masculine". At the same time when I visit my hometown I am a lot more conscious of my mannerisms and voice as to pass as straight. And during this time I have never been discriminated against, however my anxiety is ten fold compared to when I am expressing myself comfortably.

At the end of the day, as a minority group we will never experience the true privilege of those outside the LGBTQ+ community. But in a society that rewards traditional conceptions of masculinity and femininity, it pays to conform albeit uncomfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I guess queer baiting (playing into the concept of a gaydar) is when a straight person creates a gay character using rhetoric they think they know about us, but in a way that is "safe" and for marketing purposes. It is concerned with the acceptance of the straight approval (because on paper nothing queer happens) compared to being unapologetic and a true ally to the queer community.

Queer coding (I think?) might be when an informed straight/ gay person creates a gay character using tropes that are easily understood as gay pop culture with no attempt to explain it to a straight audience.  Here, the concern is with the queer community. Although I think it's still in the realm of queer baiting if it makes no attempt to create an openly safe space for queer audiences.

eg: 2 guys have sexual tension but it's never fully realised or explained (queer baiting). Vs. A character saying something nonchalantly like "let me just make sure there's no douches in my bathroom before you use it" (cringe, idk I'm not a script writer lol).

This is just my opinion, cool question though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a healthy encounter, there is a lot more conversation.  "Do you like this" "can I do this.." "how do you feel".

Some porn shows it and some doesn't, but sometimes the bottom doesn't feel like cumming once the top has. Sometimes they cum together, and othertimes you might be waiting a little while before the other one does. In porn its pretty instantaneous.

Uncontrolled farting during anal is real and pretty normal especially if the top keeps going out and in and changing positions.

Body hair exists.

Aesthetic cum shots are rare. Sometimes it goes where you want, other times it's on the walls.

Sex is sweaty! If there's no towel, there's no way I'm sleeping in that bed until the sheets are changed. There's a lot of cleaning up afterwards, you don't just roll over in a pile of sweat and sticky cum all naked and cold then go to sleep. </TEXT>

* Do bottoms find it hard to walk after some intense sex?

No, but your booty hole burns a little. You won't be wobbling or limping and shit tho.

* Does the bottom experience hip pain after?

No.

* Do people really do it in multiple rounds? I read a manhwa where they had sex from afternoon to evening and then the bottom was sick for like 10 days. Does that actually happen?

I mean naturally there is going to be breaks. The most energetic experience i've had was 3 times in 1 night (10pm, 3am, 8am)

* Does the top usually finger the bottom before they have sex?

For me, yeah. But as long as you're relaxed and you know you're not too tight then it's not necessary.

* Do you tell the bottom if you're going to put it in?

Yeah. Otherwise it's rape.

* Is leaving hickeys all over the body a thing gay people do? I swear some characters look like a dalmatian after they do it lol

Some people do it. I enjoy it but I tend to do it in discrete places.

* Kissing your partner in the neck, ear face, everywhere else?

Depends. The ear and face thing is a bit much for me. I feel like I'm drowning.

* Does the bottom get tighter when he gets turned on so much? Say like the top something said very hot

No, if anything the opposite happens. I love that idea tho haha. It usually tightens during orgasm though.

* Does sex usually follow after resolving an argument?

If it's a serious argument I ain't sleeping in the same bed. But being affectionate to make up for something is pretty common.

* Do you guys talk while having sex?

During it, it's a bit of a turn off if we start talking about groceries, but dirty talk is common for me and talking about boundaries/ consent as well.

* In general, is anal sex more taxing for the bottom? In most mangas/manhwas I've read, the bottom usually lies dumbfounded in bed after sex while the top acts like nothing happened.

I guess it depends on the position and relationship. I'm a bit biased but I think the bottom does a lot of the work (including preparation and facilitation). Maybe because all my partners have been tall, but laying on my back on a bed is the most uncomfortable position for me when receiving anal. The penis to butt angle is so random, I feel like a jigsaw piece. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TLDR (because its 2am and I'm manic):

Go into it like it's a debate, have receipts and a structure to the conversation. Listen to her as well and she'll listen to you. Conversations like these aren't going to be revolutionary, they will usually have little impact on both parties, but they are important.

\--

&#x200B;

I'm not American so I can't offer the best specific advice. But I can share some things that have helped me (gay m) with my conservative mother.

The first thing is to treat it like you going into a debate. First, set some ground rules. I say things like "It would mean a lot to me if we could have a conversation about \_ and listen to each other respectfully." Make sure you allow for everyone to speak, even if they are saying things that are false or are hurtful. It's so easy to interrupt someone who we don't agree with, or walk out when someone says something you disagree with so intensely. If someone hears you out, you're probably going to hear you out as well. As soon as someone starts getting angry, then it's no loner a constructive conversation and the entire conversation past and following is pretty well disregarded entirely.

&#x200B;

Get into the mindset of a conservative person, google things you can imagine coming out of their mouth so you can better understand what is a popular opinion amongst that demographic so you can form some counter arguments. I had a conversation with my mum last night, she bought up that more white people die in custody compared to indigenous australians, and because I knew that was a trending conversation amongst conservative news, I could talk about the exact numbers and disproportionate percentages, to let her know why that doesn't actually mean anything.  And when she understood. She also mentioned things I was unaware of, so I acknowledged I didn't know about that and that I agree why she find it frustrating, but I'll need to look into it before I form my opinion. She agreed to sit down with my later to talk about it.

&#x200B;

It's easy to get defensive, but think about some things you want to talk about and make notes like you're going into a debate so that you can stay focussed and structures so that the conversation is constructive and not just 2 people talking about their feelings, because trying to change someones feelings is almost impossible within a single conversation so we need to give them some points to take with them and think about.

&#x200B;

Finally, and it's probably the hardest thing to do. Be vulnerable. At the end of the day this is your mother, and she cares about you (or not, but there is a relationship there regardless). It's difficult to rebut someones experience and personal story without appearing like an asshole (mot of the time) and for that reason it's so effective in a debate with someone who knows you. Talk about your experience and how conservative ideals have and will impact your existence. I've spoken to my family about how I have been threatened and feared for my life because of my sexuality and encounters I've had from people using conservative notions to discriminate against me. Lean into that, and share that raw moment with someone so that when they vote they have that story in the back of their head knowing that they are choosing to support or not support that. Alternatively, use someone else's story to reiterate why you have the political stance you have. I spoke to my mum about a girl my age who died because police dealt with her restrictively and violently in when she was having a panic attack and she was just as emotional as I was in that moment.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, we need to get rid of the romantic idea that we are going to have a life altering conversation with someone who doesn't share the same opinions as we do. The best case scenario for these situations is that no one gets angry and both sides feel understood and take something away with them. The way we view our political opinions are the same way that conservatives view their political opinions. We might be wrong sometimes, and we also need to recognise that other wise we aren't wanting to have a conversation, we're trying to have an argument or at best a lecture.

&#x200B;

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the reply.

I don't have good sources on my mind for dealing with homophobic thoughts for a straight person, but try googling things like "I used to be homophobic" "how I learnt to accept the lgbtq+ community" "gay men make me uncomfortable" "what it's like to be gay/ lgbtq+" "issue faced by the lgbtq+ community". You're so right, some people do unfortunately use their religion to discriminate, there are also quite a few countries where homosexuality is illegal, and punishable by death and in other countries including the USA, Australia and England, there are state or national laws that allow for people to discriminate towards lgbtq+ people. Homophobia is everywhere, the first step to changing that is finding how closely it is in relation to your own life.

Analysing your own mind is also a good place to start, who were you surrounded by when you were growing up/ now and did they contribute to your thoughts on gay people, asking yourself questions like that is important.

I can't answer why you find men kissing uncomfortable and not men holding hands, but there are lots of subtle ways homophobia can manifest and it's so sad because no one want's to feel uncomfortable for something they cant control! I am a gay man and the idea of straight sex doesn't make me uncomfortable or envious, I can appreciate the vagina but I don't see it as a sexual thing. To me it's just a body part (that happens to be incredible and complex).

I don't blame you for being uncomfortable with gay sex, it's not in mainstream media and we didn't grow up knowing about it or seeing it portrayed in media the same way straight sex is, and when gay sex is discussed or portrayed it is it's usually grossly vulgar and unrealistic. Sex is beautiful, regardless of who is involved. Sex can also not be beautiful, but that is also regardless of who is involved.

At the end of the day you are uncomfortable with aspects of the gay identity, and that's not a nice feeling for you or for gay people. But as long as you're not spreading hate, and trying to better yourself then that's a good place to start. Just be aware of your reactions to gay people and I think you will be an excellent ally to the lgbtq+ community and I welcome you and thank you.

This isn't an issue that can be fixed over night, or even within a few weeks or months. This is a process of unlearning so much that we have learnt for many many yeas, and that has been instilled in society for hundreds of years before that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a few things to unpack here, thank you for asking for advice!

Homophobia is a blanket term for the unreasoning fear of or antipathy toward homosexuals and homosexuality. If you saw two men kissing, or two men holding hands how would that make you feel? How do you feel about feminine gay men?

I'm sure you didn't mean it but "freedom of choice" isn't relevant to sexuality since sexuality isn't a choice :) I don't think anyone would choose to be discriminated against.

When you call an aspect of someones life "gross" or "disgusting" then that's a bit rude in my opinion. At the same time thinking of lesbians as "hot" or purely sexual is another form of small minded thinking. It's the idea that lesbians aren't real, but are to serve male sexual desire.

Whether your intent isn't to discriminate or be hateful towards LGBTQ+ people, you can still be homophobic because it's a learnt behaviour and mentality. Just like men are raised largely to be misogynistic, and white people are raised to be racist whether directly or passively. It isn't your fault, but it is your fault if you recognise homophobic attitudes and do nothing to change them. Proper education is the best medicine for this! Listen to LGBTQ+ people's stories with coming out, their struggles with their identity. Read into some of the laws that encourage discrimination towards LGBTQ+ people. Read into how we are treated globally not just locally.

You will be uncomfortable when trying to make change to your thinking, but eventually you wont  be uncomfortable and thats when you know you aren't homophobic.

&#x200B;

Good luck! Thanks for reaching out, it means a lot :) If you have any further questions feel free to ask away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel the exact same way. My experience was 6 years ago and to this day it still effects me. For me I've accepted that they had things going on in their life that they felt they couldn't be themselves and they will live with this guilt for a very long time, so I am sad for them not angry anymore. In someways I do feel like I was stripped of a lot of things, considering I was catfished by an older person when I was 14 and I feel like I was boosted into a maturity that I wasn't ready for. But I see it as a lesson and I see ways in which my life has been benefitted from the lessons I learnt.

When a catfish uses you for your body and emotional gain, in many ways they take so much of your worth and belittle it to a screen and sweet meaningless words. I've learnt to never  accept someone's words as having any power over my life, instead actions will always be so much more valued to me and I think this had helped me avoid a lot of potential bad situations and relationships so far.

It's hard not to feel embarrassed, but just know that your catfish has made you feel that way. It's their attempt to make you feel like you were to blame. "how could I have been so stupid", is probably a mantra people that were catfished recite every day, but I think it's important to recognise that you were not stupid, your catfish was clever and fooled you. If a magician fools a volunteer we don't think of the volunteer as stupid. Feel empowered  that you were the volunteer that eventually found out and understood what was going on. Not a lot of people can do that, so it's pretty remarkable.

This was a traumatic experience, whether it feels like it or not and whatever feelings you hold are valid and real. You deserve so much better, and I think you know that as well which is amazing hindsight that not everyone gets.

keep going, you are not alone and there was nothing you could have done with the resources you had at the time that would have prevented this from happening. <3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> That must be really difficult for you. I know that you don't want to tell anyone, but I would really encourage seeking out a student counsellor  if there is one available. They are bound to confidentiality in the countries I am aware of, so what you say to them stays between you and them unless it's a crisis situation, then they will ask permission to seek help from other sources. Some towns or local areas also have designated counsellors.  In the meantime here are a few useful and anonymous resources.

Beyond Blue [https://www.beyondblue.org.au/](https://www.beyondblue.org.au/) has a help call and message service as well as a bunch of great resources. They are an australian organisation so be mindful of the available service hours.

Lifeline is another great service that offers crisis support [https://www.lifeline.org.au/](https://www.lifeline.org.au/) . It can be scary to call these services or message their team, the first time is always the scariest but trust me they really can help!

Kids helpline [https://kidshelpline.com.au/](https://kidshelpline.com.au/) also offers a variety of support and resources especially for teenagers.

&#x200B;

Whatever is going on can be scary and you can feel so alone, but just know that your experience and emotions are valid and you are not alone. I know what it's like to be scared your parents might disown you, but your life is more important than the approval of society or those close to you. Things will get better, not right away, and maybe not for a little while. But eventually, and slowly, things will be okay. And I know how frustrating that is to hear and you don't have to believe me. But you will find people that understand you and will be able to help you, you just have to reach out.

&#x200B;

Good luck, I believe in you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Update: I was diagnosed with bipolar II by my psychiatrist.

Hello, I hope this is okay to post.

I've been suffering turbulent mental health issues since I was a child (20 now). After a depressed episode I tell myself I'll get help, then it passes and I can't even imagine being sad I am so pleased and happy with life, so I don't get help. This cycle has been happening for the past 6 years. But yesterday I finally saw a doctor about it, but with a cover story that I was concerned with my thyroid. I've seen a therapist before but I also had a cover story that I wanted to learn how to better help a friend, and I have never had a session when I was depressed.

After the doctor saw through my thyroid issue, he began running physical and mental health tests on me and I am definitely uncomfortable with the amount of information I shared. I feel like I was faking it, like this is all in my figurative head and that I'm a phoney. (this is typical when I get out of my depression and into these weird states). One thing has been playing on my mind a lot, he seemed really concerned with the information I was telling him, and I saw him write down manic depression in his notes. He then asked to see me for a long appointment after the weekend as we wait for the blood test results, although he told me a few times he didn't think this was a thyroid issue (I was pretty persistent).

I am really scared that I might get diagnosed with bipolar, not because of the disorder but because I've been running from this for so long and I don't think I'm ready for this to be real, and that I won't just grow out of this. I'm unsure if I'll go to the next appointment, and I've been considering telling him that I've been making things over dramatic and that I'm actually fine.

I'm not sure why I'm posting this, but I think it might be a way to keep myself accountable.

Thank you for letting me get this off my chest. </TEXT>

But I think this might do more harm than good especially for your mental health. Also I can imagine the girls profile you are using probably would feel a bit violated knowing she's on a dating site without her consent even if you aren't engaging with the matches (which I really hope you're not). Hang in there girl, you'll get the love of your life someday and it'll be real not superficial like a lot of the matches this girls profile is getting. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Catfish Contacted Me After 6 Years </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-05-16 20:13:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've never told anyone this, but I think it's time to share my story and  how my catfish contacted me afterwards. I'm still embarrassed this happened and that it still effects me, so this is me trying to let go for good.

(Disclaimer; Mentions of the word 'suicide attempt', some of this information might be slightly inaccurate)

When I was 14-15 (I am now 20) I had a psychotic break. I was going through a lot and needless to say I wasn't thinking straight. One day a person slid into my DMs on instagram and we started talking. He made me feel worthy and attractive, on top of this his instagram photos and profile picture was gorgeous. He was very fit, had blonde hair and blue eyes. We would message each other constantly throughout the day. He was from the other side of the world so I would often sleep only a few hours or not at all just so I could talk to him longer. He was a year older than me and made me feel invincible. But things started to get weird and it's only in hindsight that I noticed how bizarre things were since I was very out of it.

After a few weeks of messaging he asked me if he could be my boyfriend and I accepted. We started calling on the phone, I loved hearing his voice and wanted to facetime him so badly but his phone camera didn't work... Besides, I would sometimes get glimpses of him on his cousin's snapchat however his face was always drawn over due to his insecurities.  It was also around this time that he told me about his son who was 2 years old to his ex who was significantly older. I slowly became invested in this child's life at 15 and I thought I was ready to become a step parent. (I'm cringing as much as you all probably are) It got to the point where I began applying for work in hopes that I could send him money to care for his child until I saved enough to move to his country. I had no intention of telling my family about this.

We would bond on our struggles with mental health, and would talk in depth about our suicide attempts. One day he stopped responding after sending some alarming messages. I didn't hear from him, his friend (15M) or his cousin (16F) who I had also been introduced to by him. Until eventually his cousin told me he was in hospital. A few weeks later I got a reply and he was ok. I was so happy, unfortunately he would repeat this a few times later.

It was also after his reappearance that his ex started messaging me about what a terrible person he was and that he would never be as into me as he was to her. I ignored this and blocked her.

Thankfully I don't recall ever sending him naked pictures of myself, but I remember him offering to send pictures to me (I never accepted them) however we would sometimes talk sexually. (I know what you're thinking, how could he send nudes if he couldn't send a face pic. DW I get less naive). From here on things slowly began falling apart and I would occasionally get doubtful but the thought of questioning him and losing him was too scary.

One day he sent a photo to me. Only something seemed different than the previous photos he sent me. Then it clicked. He had a different hair colour and a nose ring. I asked him about this, and he said his brother dyed his hair in his sleep and he doesn't wear his nose ring often, and I thought fair enough. (jesus christ..). In retrospect he changed his catfish appearance and began using someone else's photos but unfortunately my brain was too unstable to recognise my boyfriend now being a different person. I don't know if it was a combination of my psychotic episode and me starving myself for days, or the lies he told me but things like this seemed completely normal to me.

The curtain began to slowly crumble in the following month. I noticed that someone followed me on instagram, the handle was something along the lines of  '(unrecognised name) fanclub' with my boyfriend as the profile picture and no other content. I was confused so I messaged him about it. He told me to ignore it and that it was just his ex trying to get to me. So I ignored it and things were fine, only I began to get suspicious. I remember drawing a table called "reasons my boyfriend is real and reasons he is actually his cousin (16F)". (Yay me!) Now I don't know why I thought he might be his cousin, I have a lot of blank pieces of memory from this period but I remember little bits and after the years I've slowly began putting pieces back together. I tore this piece of paper up (dang it), threw it away and tried not to think about it, because the thought of losing him broke my heart more than if he weren't actually real. I had already dealt with losing him to suspected suicide attempts, gone through the pain of a long distance relationship, invested myself in his child and he had saved me from my own suicide attempts.

But I couldn't stop thinking about it, and later his ex messaged me again telling me to look up an instagram handle. So I did.... And it was pictures of my boyfriend, only he had a different name and was actually in university. It then dawned on me. My entire world collapsed. I had been catfished for the past 6 months. My entire world, the person I messaged up to 22 hours a day wasn't real. The person I was preparing to move across the world and begin a family with at age 15 wasn't real. I confronted him and he admitted it wasn't him. He then sent me a picture of his real face and name. He wasn't unattractive but my heart was broken and I was finally mentally coherent enough to understand what was going on. Or so I thought (this was also a fake profile)... I blocked him and everyone else he introduced me to. I don't remember much of what came next, but I remember taking a long bath and laughing hysterically proving I probably wasn't as mentally coherent as I thought (oops).

Queue me having what I think is another psychotic episode and not remembering the next 6 months but some where along the lines I began eating again and going to sleep more regularly (things seemed to turn out alright for me!). I did well in school and got into my top university, started therapy and am now in my 3rd year of university.

The story is almost over I promise!

So a few months ago someone messaged me on instagram. My stomach sunk once I saw the profile and it looked just like my catfish's cousin who was the same age as him and female. They then messaged me and confessed that they were my catfish however now identify was a transgender male. It all made sense and I wish I could go back in time and tell 15 year old me that I was right. I thanked my catfish for contacting me to apologise and said I needed time to process and ask questions. Turns out they were the age they said they were, they were going through mental health issues and were using other peoples photos to catfish me, and during our phone calls they had their male friend on the phone and was telling him what to say to me. I told that person i love them, and they told me they loved me and i think that's what I'm mostly uncomfortable with to this day. My catfish was also apparently unaware of how sick I was which I'm not sure if I believe. But I am not angry anymore, I am more sad for who we both were back then. I blocked him after getting my answers however I still don't know what the deal with the baby was, who the friend he introduced me to was, or anything about the ex that was trying so hard to tell me he was a catfish, and I'm okay with not knowing.

I know I will never be able to forget that period of my life, but I think I'm ready to move on and to forgive not only my catfish but also myself who I have blamed for this for so long. It's been my dirty secret for 6 years but I think I'm ready for this to end. Thank you, genuinely, if you read this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Internalised homophobia is tough and I think you're on the right track in wanting to mentally prepare yourself for gay sex, but also recognising that it exists is huge. For me coming out was obviously no. 1 in helping me feel 100% comfortable with my sexuality. But besides that,  educating myself on lgbtq history and media, listening to others stories, and making friends with openly and empowered lgbtq people has also helped tremendously. But I identify as gay, I don't know if this is helpful for a heteroromantic person. good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA - but doing this will start an even bigger drama when I can imagine all you want is to recover peacefully. If she is the kind of person to regularly make you feel bad when you are in a vulnerable position then I think a bit of pettiness might not hurt. If this seems out of character for her, then maybe she's going through shit and you might just be acting out of frustration because you have been through something intense so you're probably not thinking 100% clearly which is absolutely normal. Your brain and your body need time to heal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> F. yeah this sucks, my mum is the same sometimes. I came out to her she was a mess, now we're fine again but she still thinks I'll eventually marry a women and whenever I tell her that won't happen she denies it.

I dunno man, I would do this like a week before heading back to uni, not in the middle of quarantine. This seems like the absolute worst time to bring up any drama with the family. But at the end of the day you are your own person and you shouldn't let people corner you if you've established that you're in a safe environment since they 'accepted' your sexuality initially.  Maybe just bring it up in subtle ways, like mention how attractive a certain guy is on TV or flaunt your femininity a little (being feminine is a gay stereotype but sometimes it helps to play into those stereotypes when wanting to come out to people without directly doing it).

I've kind of learnt to have fun with it and sort of force my mum to deal with my gayness. When I give her fashion advice I say things like "what kind of gay son would I be if I didn't give you fashion advice" which is super obnoxious and I'd hate to witness that which is kind of the point. This is all in good fun though, my mum and I are super close and we love each other so much but she's from a miseducated generation and sometimes forgets that sexuality isn't a choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, thank you for posting! This is such a difficult time and being in a non-supportive environment makes things a lot more challenging. I grew up surrounded by homophobic people and the best advice I can give is to focus on school and friendships with supportive people. It can feel like this will never end but I promise one day it will get better and you will be able to live authentically and happily.
I would love if you could come out and everything would be fine, but the reality is your safety should always come first. Look at your local community and see if there are any lgbt support groups that will give you space to be yourself whilst in company with supportive people.

I would avoid the temptation to go onto gay websites or gay chat rooms as these will be very sexual and dangerous for young people, this is speaking from experience.

There will come a day when you can be free and safe, but until then work on yourself and let this be the fire beneath you to do amazing things so you can get away from your homophobic environment. Good luck darling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm cis and I'm not a fan of my name. It's a nice name but I just don't feel connected to it at all and I've always felt uncomfortable telling people my name or when people refer to me by my name. But I don't feel gender dysphoria around it (it is a gender non specific name though) and I don't feel that changing it will improve my quality of life. Because I've only ever heard 'deadname' as a term used by trans people, if I changed my name I wouldn't refer to it as a deadname since I don't identify as trans. Even if the meaning is 'previous name' I think we need to take into account the cultural meanings and implications as well. I think it might be similar to other LGBTQ+ terminology like 'queer' or even 'gay', when in the past these were adjectives, now they are identities of LGBTQ+ people and so I can't imagine a straight person using those words as adjectives in everyday conversation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Might be different because I'm an RA in an Australian College. I've been an RA for 2 years now and this is my general vibe.

The interviewers are interested in your ability to connect with a wide variety of people and also your ability to work as a part of a team. Things that might help include academic success but also times you struggled with class and how you overcame those challenges. They're looking for someone who is caring, obviously, and who can fill a role no one else can - for example introverted people can connect with residents that might be more shy - people from locations far away from the college can connect with people of the same experience - people of a minority group who can act as a relatable and safe person to talk to - extroverts who can bring people out of their shells. Really look into who you are and how you can use that as a strength when creating connections with people, don't try to fit a mould of what you think an RA should be. Another important one from my interviews was not caring about where you would be placed and the room you got because it shows you're an RA because of the job not the room. Also like others have said, being an RA isn't about the money (although it's nice). Finally something that was stressed in all of my interviews was how comfortable you would be to address an issue you had with a choice made by administration. Good luck! In my experience being an RA has been one of the most intense things but also the most rewarding things I've ever done. I love my job and my residents :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> My college has 300 students. (Keep in mind colleges in Australia are for residential purposes only and it's not particularly common to stay at a college opposed to renting an apartment or staying at home). So last year I only had 15 residents, and this year I have 21. I've found its worked really well in building genuine connections with my residents. I remember last year at the end of the year some of my residents and I were crying because we wouldn't be in the same building next year. It also means that my residents and I can regularly message each other on facebook to keep in contact and I still have a close connection with my residents from previous years. Maybe it's just me but I end up feeling so emotionally connected with my residents that I've cried when talking about how proud I am of them in the past. Maybe I'm just a mess haha. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Taking on other people's emotional distress and responding to emergencies can be super emotionally and physically draining! Professional psychologists also talk to other psychologists and colleagues regularly because of this. If you can try to see a councillor at your university, or talk to another RA. You can keep confidentiality of your residents whilst talking about particularly draining scenarios. I did this in my first year of being an RA and it helped a lot to get alternative advice but also to get some pretty heavy stuff off my chest. There is also a suicide call back service in Australia that I've used in the past to debrief with someone after someone has come to me with suicidal behaviours or thoughts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There have been so many I've lost track. But recently my friend introduced me to her boyfriend whilst i was practicing, he approached me kind of awkwardly as I was putting my guitar down so I stood up and went for a hand shake because I thought that's what straight guys do (I'm gay)... he was going in for a hug but changed his mind half way through so we kind of held hands whilst hugging with the guitar in between us... After that encounter the three of us stood silently and he sat down and asked if I was going to play something to serenade them.I don't know if it's because I'm an introvert but for some reason weird social interactions like this happen to me often.

Yesterday I was walking to the dining hall at college and I bumped into this guy I've been kinda avoiding, we talked then I tried going to the bathroom because I need to but also so we wouldn't sit together, he followed me in. Then whilst eating he accidentally spills food on me, I pour him a cup of water and I spill the water on myself and the floor.

There are so many more but I think the moral of this story is that I don't avoid social interactions on purpose but otherwise shit like this happens to me daily. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you're struggling right now, but it will be okay eventually :) . It might not seem like it right now but there is nothing wrong with being gay if you think you might be. A lot of us have struggled with what you are going through and have turned out happier than you could imagine. Just hold on and try not to worry about what those around you might be saying or what pressures you feel under, you're in a part of your life that you're discovering core parts of your identity and it's normal to feel confused.

We can't change who we are and we sexuality isn't a choice as unfortunate as that may seem right now. I was also more feminine than other boys in high school and I only had friends that were girls, and I was super self conscious of that. But eventually you'll learn that what makes you different is a strength. I'm in my 3rd year of university and it's only been in the past 2 years that i've made friends with straight guys and learnt to explore my femininity and masculinity unafraid and unapologetically. It'll be okay, whatever your sexuality is :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclaimer - these are gay male specific.

There are a lot of great short movies out there as well. From memory I recently rewatched "are we okay" but there's so many on youtube to binge you might have to weed through some cringe ones though but once you get deep into it theres soo many high quality ones. They are a lot more thought provoking and emotionally intense than quite a few queer movies i've watched. Although a lot of them are quite sad there are a few that have happy endings, unlike queer films that seem to only be sad besides love simon. But to this day my favourite queer media is actually a series called "Please Like Me" it's also pretty sad but it's nothing has ever moved me or felt more authentic than that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA - I don't know if pansies is as derogatory for you as it is where I live but that sucks. I know the struggle of being vegetarian/ vegan in a meat eating family where people seem to take it as a personal insult. It's 1 maybe 2 meals that have no meat in them, it puzzles me how people would get upset over that unless they had allergies to a large number of vegetables. However I think that in these scenarios apologising to make your partner happy should take precedence over maintaining face and having 20 people your partner cares about not come,  especially if you're about to marry that person. When it comes to family gossip and drama I think people are going to remember the time that 20 family members actively didn't go to a wedding opposed to the time someone 'insulted' an aunt and then the wedding went ahead fine.

Good luck, maybe give her fake meat and tell her it's real to maintain pettiness and also a good relationship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! This is going to be long. It's 3am...

I grew up with a mum that wasn't blatantly homophobic but made some comments and we had complete opposite political views. Regardless she was my best friend, we would gossip and talk to each other like it was nothing.

I came out at 18 after overhearing that she apparently voted yes in the Australian vote for marriage equality. I was expecting her to maybe already know and say she loves me and have one of those happy movie type moments. But unfortunately she was hysterical and said a lot of really messed up things to me. Following this we had a rough few weeks where she could barely make eye contact with me. She eventually saw an anglican bishop after I refused to see one and he was surprisingly accepting.

But (and I promise this gets better) she slowly came around to where she started speaking to me again and said she just need time. Flash forward and I went to college and came back after a year and she was actively trying to understand. We were back to talking like a son and mother again and she even asked if she could watch love simon with me which was a huge moment. It was a bit awkward and we didn't speak about it for months. But she has been slowly getting warmer and last year she started asking me about my dating life and the guys I was seeing. She was still persistent in the fact that she wanted me to eventually end up with a girl.

So now we're back to this year and we are talking like we used to, we text and facetime regularly. And although it's not like we're talking about it often at all, it is clear that she loves me and supports me if it means I'm happy.

\----

So here's why I think she came around.

I was a noticeably depressed teenager and after coming out and coming back from college i was completely different and happy. I think a lot of the fear that parents have is that their child will have a difficult life and won't find happiness so seeing your child flourish is a wake up call. I was thankful in that my older brother and other extended family were very defensive and in support of me when she tried to consolidate with them and talk negatively about me. In my first year I also became close friends with a proud lesbian and I think her seeing that there are others who are also thriving normalised it a bit. But primarily I think it's just time and knowledge.

My mum wasn't homophobic, she was just had false ideas of what being gay meant. Good luck :)

<TEXT> That's a lovely message. I would still be wary of mentioning him being gay at all if you have a conversation with him. He might feel 'found out' and become further withdrawn. I'm so happy to hear you've allowed him to see that you're understanding and I was super shy when I was a teen dealing with my sexuality. I think having that little chat mentioning that you are there for him might be a nice little bonding moment.

I have an older brother and before I came out I was scared to tell him. If he had  said he was there for me without referring to sexuality I think I wouldn't have felt that way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, kinda emosh reading this - you're a great sister. I think it's important for someone to come out in their own time and we can't force people but in this case I think some prompting might help because I'm concerned for his mental health. Once corona is over or if you can get into a situation when you are both alone and comfortable try having a chat with him and say that you love him and if there's anything he wants to talk about ever you are accepting and there for him. Or you could also show signs that you support lgbt+ as long as you are safe to do so, things like posting on your instagram story (if he follows it) that you support lgbt+ people. You have to wait for him to come to you, you can't force people without doing damage but you can help them know they're safe. Don't say "I know you are gay" or "someone told me you are gay" or "I saw your instagram account" (his instagram is his safe space don't take that away form him) instead if he questions you say things like "I'm your sister I know things",  "sisters intuition". Good luck and honestly you are an amazing person :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a very optimistic approach and won't work for many siblings. But try asking if you can have a mature discussion with her. It feels awkward as hell but literally say to her "can we have a mature and open discussion?". Then talk to her about this (or like text her or some shit). If she gets angry and physical then she hasn't reached that maturity level yet. But also you need to recognise if you're being constructive or are responding in anger and emotion. Once again - this is a very rainbows and sunshine approach not all families are like this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's a super personal decision. If you feel like you are lying to him, or you are holding your breath because you are not out to him then I think tell him - it'll make you feel a lot better and it's the only way of knowing if he'll react bad or not. You'll either gain a closer connection with your friend, or you'll figure out he isn't that great of a person leaving you with 1 less toxic friend- win win. Coming out is primarily about giving yourself closure, if this relationship doesn't need that then I don't think there's a need to come out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've come out to a few religious people and this is generally how it went.

My mum (she's only christian when convenient) - came out at 18 - was hysterical and said all kinds of fucked up shit to me, she wanted me to see a bishop and get help.. obviously wasn't going to do that so she went to see an anglican bishop for herself and he told her that "there are somethings that we love and other things we cant change about our children" and after a few weeks she slowly came around and began talking to me again. It took about a year before we talked about it again and now she's my best friend. She still says she wishes I was straight but has embraced me and has asked me about dating guys and we've watched gay films together.

My step dad (devout catholic) - came out at 18 - He already had 2 gay children and when I came out it was the same reaction. He didn't care but he was insistent that he didn't agree with it. He was a pretty quiet guy but he didn't attend his sons wedding and I don't think he talks to them often. He did say that he will always be there for me (ironic because they broke up messily) so that was nice.

My Grandmother (born again christian) - didn't come out but my brother told her when I was 19 - We had some pretty lengthy chats about it which was weird but good. She said she doesn't support it and thinks it's against god but she loves me because I'm still her grandchild. She doesn't want me to bring a man into her house or display any signs of being gay which is fair enough. She was from a different generation and grew up in a rural area so she really had no idea. I told her a lot of things but she still doesn't quite understand why some gay men 'act' feminine. Overall I totally thought she would disown me if she found out so this was honestly best case scenario.

My Dad (not religious but whilst we're on the topic) - didn't come out but my brother told him when I was 18/19 - Told me he straight up loved me and didn't care. We haven't spoken about it since. He's a mechanic, really macho biker guy and thought i'd never come out to him so this was nice. My dad is pretty racist and ignorant if that helps.

&#x200B;

TLDR : Those you expect will react badly might actually react really well. Those who you think would react fine might unfortunately react the worst. Either way if you are in a safe environment, coming out is one of the best feelings you will feel. I am a completely different person and have a different view on life since coming out. Good luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> there might be something there but I know plenty of queer people that didn't experience that. It's unfortunately really common  for straight people as well. I'm not a fan of people (usually homophobes) arguing that being abused as a child is the 'cause' of being gay. I'm sure there are genuine people out there interested, I just think you've got to be a bit careful here to not give fuel to damage gay people and people who had to go through child abuse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> bruh there are some issues going on here. You're just attracted to him because he fits the 'straight guy' mould and on top of that he has the self degrading qualities that appeal to you for some reason. Had this too when I was in high school - id fall for the trashiest guys because i thought thats all i deserved and it fit the mould of all the straight girls and their boyfriends around me. For the love of god please don't tell him you have a crush on him unless he comes out to you. Even if ya'll got together he would still be in the closet and that shit ain't fun to deal with in a relationship. I also had a gay guy tell me he had a crush on me before I was comfortable to come out and that was awkward for him to get let down and for me to pretend to be straight. jesus im so glad im not a teenager anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had the same thing happen to me last year - got with a guy and fell for him then something changed and he felt way too clingy. For me it was a slow build up of pet peeves that ended in me really not liking the guy. When we start talking to someone new we're kinda "love" or "dick" blind so naturally once you're removed from that like on spring break we see things clearer and realise this ain't it fam. I think being angry at a bottom because of an accident is fucked up - he obviously didn't mean to be messy and it's such a traumatic experience for bottoms and tops to a lesser extent. Bashing you on social media is a shit move on his behalf and shows his true colours so I think you averted a crisis like I did last year. But don't go bashing on him, there's no point and it'll just fuel the agitation you have towards him. Somethings are just a bit of fun and other things are serious. this seems like it was just a bit of fun and thats totally ok. </TEXT>

Just remind yourself of your boundaries and expectations some guys can try to manipulate that. The only concern I see here is to check if he is actually 18.

<TEXT> 100% agree. I'm sure some people have been lucky enough not to have noticed transphobia in their local gay community but I see it a lot around me. I think some people think that because they are apart of the lgbt+ community that they have a free pass to say derogatory things about other genders/ sexualities. I think it also comes from the fact that a lot of straight people (more popular in certain areas of the world) don't see a difference between trans females and gay men so to distance ourselves some gay men say shitty things about trans females. </TEXT>

I think for me it was making friends that are also lgbt+ and hearing their experiences and telling them mine. Also watching a lot of educational and not thirsty gay youtubers. watching gay movies - love simon was a great one, please like me - is a great comedy series thats also kinda sad. I think it just comes with time and for some it might take longer than others. Focus less on the sexual aspects of being interested in guys and more on you as an individual and how you feel about being gay. Once we disassociate gay with meaning gay sex then lots of this goes away. good luck </TEXT>

If you feel pressure down there or feel like you need to shit then don't have sex and wait until you've gone to the bathroom because there's probably too much there to douche. If you feel fine then maybe douche to make sure. I think it's silly not to eat before sex because you're worried about shitting. We know our bodies and if the top is that up tight that they demand your entire bowel system is empty and clean then I'm sure there are plenty of bottoms out there that will degrade themselves for a quick fuck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think most gay men have some level of internalised homophobia. It's the idea that you can be gay but still have small microagressions towards the gay community. I think this comes from the fact that we grew up in a homophobic society and had to deal with the idea of being gay a lot sooner and with less maturity than others. Gay men have to go on a journey of acceptance with the baseline of being slightly homophobic. Some things are easier to change our thinking of and other things are "internalised" meaning they're suppressed and we haven't dealt with them yet which is fine. Your journey doesn't end once you come out of the closet. I don't know if preferences are internalised homophobia but I think our preferences will change over time so if in 20 years we are attracted to slightly less masculine men then maybe there was a little homophobia there. I'm also attracted to masculine men and I'm slightly feminine. I don't know the answers to this question but I think its exciting that we have such a direct way of working on ourself and connection with our selves that straight people might never experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA - Sarah needs professional help. I went through a similar situation and it sucks, its completely draining and this goes way past a normal friendly advice conversation or being there for a friend. I think you should tell her your boundaries and that she you cannot help her in the way she needs. You can be a friend for her and offer her friendship level support but you cannot be her on call therapist and that it feels like she is diverting all of her baggage rather than dealing with it. I would encourage you to also use the free counselling services, they can give excellent advice on how to deal with this and also are there to listen to you. I work in student counselling and even I regularly see counsellors to talk about this stuff in confidence the way you are doing here. Good luck, remember you can't be a help to anyone if you're not helping yourself.

&#x200B;

edit: when this happened to me I straight up told my friend I am there for her and love her but I cannot talk about such dark topics without feeling drained anymore and she needs to respect that so I can continue to be there for her. She was a bit upset a first but this strengthened our relationship a lot for a few years. </TEXT>

Be persistent and they might change their minds, maybe try asking if you can have a mature discussion sitting down without any yelling or judgement to hear their concerns (and without reacting right away even if they say something rude), and then you state your arguments. Good luck, and I'm so excited for you in the future when you get to shave your head :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA - You have an established relationship with him and he's obviously important to you. I think it's tricky because in my opinion he did a really shit thing to your mum and in her eyes you remaining close with him is like you've chosen a side. And if you have then its your business but I think it might be worth explaining to her that her feelings are valid and that what she had to go through must have been tough and you recognise that it was a really hard thing to go through - but that you have a bond with your stepdad and he is important in your life and your children's life. My dad cheated on my mum and after they got divorced i was still expected to have a relationship with my father - wether he's biological or not. Good luck with everything, just remember that it's okay to be selfish sometimes and put your own happiness first as long as it's not directly harming those around you </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA - this is straight up not how anyone should behave towards someone with a disability, but for a friend to act this way? I'd strong encourage you to rethink wether she is worth your time of day. I'm sorry this happened to you and I hope you don't have to be put in that scenario again, if I was there I would have thrown it down for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> YTA - You called your girlfriend out and made her look like an idiot in front of her friends. Wether it was true or not we shouldn't be publicly shaming those we love. If you don't feel appreciated or wanted to talk to her about that fact that she didnt actually buy the dog, wait for the skype to finish and chat to her in private. It's more mature and you're going to have a more meaningful conversation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ESH - Sorry this is happening to you but I wonder if it's a bit emotional right now and we aren't fully reflecting on how things are going. I understand where you're coming from as someone with mental health issues and education can be so difficult at times - just remember that you're the only person that can give yourself validation and that it's okay to ask for help from tutors, your parents, or counselling. Try having an open discussion with your parents saying that you're struggling right now and it feels like they're not listening to you and by comparing you to your older siblings it's putting a lot of pressure on you that is having a worse effect on your mental health and therefore overall performance. It's important to have open discussions like this with your parents especially when you're going through high school. I'm in college now and man were my teenage years rough - I wish I had of just invited my parents to have an open discussion about what's going on in a mature and judgement free space. This might seem very unobtainable right now but just remember that you're 16 and things will change you just have to focus on being healthy. Maybe try making a study plan or if studying at home isn't great try studying in the library or at school if they have dedicated spaces. good luck </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA - I hate confrontation so would have gave her the seat and asked someone else if I could take theirs. But I understand I wasn't there and this probably wasn't an option especially when someone is yelling at you in a foreign language. The lady was way out of line for yelling at you in public rather than trying to talk to the person who spoke Chinese to figure out what was going on. Just remember we never know the full story and she might have had the worst day imaginable, it wasn't your fault she reacted the way she did. I hope this post puts you at ease, its such a shit thing to go through especially with an invisible disability and anxiety. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA - I don't know if your parents are superficial but a gift doesn't have to be something expensive or even monetary at all. You can make them a nice card, put together a slide show of memories on a computer, clean their house or garage, surprise them and come home early and volunteer to help out for a little while, you could write them a heart felt letter about how much they mean to you on a sincere level. You could bring them breakfast in bed. If they're really just after something expensive that they'll never use or throw away then I'm sorry, from a broke uni student, that's super difficult and it might be worth talking to them about your current financial status. good luck! </TEXT>

In this case, you hurt a few little egos (even in the comment section). If you were to say some shit like "hope coronavirus targets men so we won't have to deal with them anymore" that might hurt a little that might just hurt. </TEXT>

You were just being funny and acknowledging she spoke the language without actually requesting she narrate. There is no sarcasm in Japanese and if she had had a long day at work and was tired she might not have picked up on the English sarcasm (I do the same) </TEXT>

You don't need to be going to intensive language classes but maybe tell her that you'll start watching Japanese for beginner videos on youtube and ask her to practise with you every now and then. It's an intimate and special part of any Interracial language and especially with Japanese people if you show that you can speak a little bit of japanese it will impress her parents a lot (trust me) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I think it's easier to come out to people you've just met because it means the connection isn't so deep that if (and we almost always expect this) they react badly and cut you off then it doesn't hurt as much as it would if you came out to a friend of 5 years and they turned their back on you. I'm sorry he didn't come out to you first, but maybe its because he values your friendship so much he was worried. Coming out is really awkward and i had the same experience having serious chats with people i'd only ever joked around with. Take your time writing an apology, it's okay to be vulnerable and serious in apologising when it's such a vulnerable and serious topic :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> YTA - (disclaimer: I'm a gay guy who went through a similar experience) Thank you for being a supportive friend and not being bothered when you found out. You need to know this is an incredibly sensitive topic and lgbt+ people need to be in control when it comes to coming out especially when they're coming out for the first time. LGBT+ people are significantly more likely to experience poor mental health compared to straight people [https://lgbtihealth.org.au/statistics/](https://lgbtihealth.org.au/statistics/), and when you keep a secret in for that long and you finally decide to embrace it - it's such an empowering and overwhelming feeling that when someone tries to out you or asks  if you're gay before you're ready it feels like the carpet has been taken beneath you and the power you finally gave back to yourself has been taken away again. LGBT+ teens are so used to being worried about gossip in the halls and that people are talking about their sexuality behind their back that it becomes a default mindset that people are out to get you and it takes many years before this paranoia goes away - So even when you've finally came out to some people, having someone ask you or tell you that they know you're gay, it means that the paranoia that caused so much anxiety was true in that moment - people were talking about his sexuality behind his back. Which isn't a bad thing because it was in good nature but his automatic response was of anxiety and being upset because that's all he has known for so long. This is an incredibly personal thing that non LGBT+ people can never understand, but when you ask someone if they're gay before they're ready to tell you, then it takes the power out of their hands and makes them feel worthless and embarrassed because; 1) all the anxiety and fear was for nothing if this person was going to be okay with my sexuality (which sound silly to be embarrassed but emotions are so raw and high during this period) 2) I will never be able to share the experience of coming out and performing such an intimate act of trust with this person because they outed me instead, 3) people are talking about me behind my back and that means that I might be unsafe if people have overheard and had a bad reaction without me witnessing it. You were just trying to be supportive and I think he knows that, and I'm sure he's so relieved that you don't care. But I think it would still be a really nice opportunity to apologise to him and tell him that you didn't realise this would make him feel this way and that you are open to talk about his sexuality if or when he deicides to and that it doesn't change anything between you to.

&#x200B;

\- Also there are some LGBT+ people that don't feel this way and that would prefer if people told them that they know they're LGBT+ and they're okay with it. But to me it sounds like your friend reacted the same way I did when I was a lot younger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ETA - I totally understand where you're coming from and that it's possible to not like someone because of their personality and it not being homophobic. I'm gay and I can't stand this gay kid in my class who acts like being gay is his entire personality. If your brother has just come out, this is pretty common as gay people finally discover who they are and it will settle down when he realised that being gay is just a part of his life and not his entire identity. I would be concerned however if you can't stand him because he is flamboyant whereas your cousin might not be an effeminate gay person. If this is the case I think there's some underlying homophobic and toxic masculinity going on and I would really courage self reflection and therapy to try to deal with that. It's not a nice feeling to dislike someone so close to you, and I hope things work out. Sometimes personalities just don't match but under no circumstance should you attack him for being flamboyant or being gay - if he is doing something annoying try to figure out why it's annoying and if it's related to him being flamboyant then thats kinda fucked up. If he's being annoying because he's telling a story he's told for the 100th time and he's being super loud and obnoxious - then you have a reason to be annoyed. This is a shit situation but I'm sure time will sort it out. Just remember he's a person too and he's dealing with a  lot of personal stuff the same way that you are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA - I just want to let you know you're super brave for coming out in the scenario you were in. Your son is definitely out of line and is probably finding any excuse to justify his behaviour . I do think that maybe you shouldn't have walked out of the therapy session though, after all the therapist has an obligation to remain unbiased and was just trying to let your son get all of his frustration out so that he could have a meaningful conversation with him and yourself. But I totally understand how difficult that must have been for you in that moment. I think time can change a lot of things and my mum was very disrespectful to me and disowned me for a little while after I came out. But time changes people and we both individually got counselling separately on our own terms.  Maybe in a non-hostile situation suggest that your son see a councillor by himself to talk about his anger, and maybe it might help you to do the same. You're not an asshole but you might have made a mistake walking out of the therapy session opposed to voicing your frustration in a safe environment, but I think a lot of people would have done the same if they really knew what you were feeling in that moment and what you've had to go through. I hope things turn out for the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA - I speak Japanese and I'm thankful you did this. You helped her to see that she's learning a language that is useful and will allow her to communicate with real people rather than just be able to understand anime without the subtitles. I think she might have been bummed out not because Japan isn't like Anime but that she was called out on something she was proud of and maybe feels embarrassed? Maybe in your next lesson open an anime and pick a scene to watch and then dissect what the people are saying and have a lesson around the vocabulary and grammar used in that segment. She'll feel appreciated that you acknowledge anime as valid but also you can teach her how to apply what she learns in anime into the real world? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I met this guy who was honestly everything I thought I wanted, but slowly I started developing pet peeves towards him. He was needy AF and needed to stay over every other day and asked me out 2 weeks after meeting. I turned him down and said "maybe one day"... He also said my name in like every sentence and by the 2nd date was already burping and farting around me and was so affectionate in public.

He was also very emotional and whilst I was working he sent a massive paragraph saying how he is so confused about this "relationship" even though I never said we were in a relationship and even denied it. Essentially I told him I didn't want a relationship with him and he continued to tell me how confused he was and just wanted me to tell him whats going on. He kept saying things along this line and in the span of 30 minutes I told him I didn't want a relationship 8 times and he was still confused.. He kept going on about how he wants to make this work and I gave him so many hints that eventually I just decided to agree to be FWB with him even though all I wanted was for him to "break up" with me even though we weren't a thing. He's tried to chat to me since but I just say I'm busy because I don't really know how you come back from that.

I really enjoyed the experiences we had together but ultimately he just started to get on my nerves and I didn't want to lead him on any more than I guess I had. He is 2 years older than me but honestly acted pretty young especially considering I had less experience with dating than he had.

Am I the asshole for ghosting a nice guy and not breaking things off or could he just not take a hint?

\- Some Extra Info-

We were "seeing each other" for about one or two months in total during which we saw each other often and he took me on some early cute dates. Pretty early into meeting up, he was telling all of his friends and family about me and saying how he wants a good life so he can support me. I met his brother a few times. I guess I selfishly didn't want to cut it off completely because I didn't want to be the person that breaks someones heart and it was pretty new to me. </TEXT>
