<TEXT> I mean If you don’t agree with me that’s fine, but that wiki page you linked was just,,,,, very cringy. Very old fashioned and not how anyone speaks. Even you’re own writing is like, actually modern Scots instead of whatever they were trying to pass off. Mad sorry that I upset you, I know what defending Scots as a language is like, I just have a personal axe to grind with non-Scottish people deciding what constitutes Scots (like the professors at “weggie uni” lmao) - which is usually what results in these stupid false sounding translations like in that wiki article. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of the signs that are actually in shops (especially small local businesses?) I’d say most are in Scots. But you seem to be using early modern Scots as the standard which I would say is like trying to use Shakespeare to show how people actually speak modern English. To be fair to you though Glaswegian is it’s own particular form of Scots so what sounds very old fashioned to me may be the reality in Ayrshire still.

Scots is still very much a living language and a lot of the work that’s been done of creating so call translations for it focuses on 19th and 18th century writings, which makes it very strange for modern Scots speakers. This was a big issue I had with it at university when they wanted us language and linguistics students to help with building the Scots corpus. </TEXT>

[This recipe ](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/3138673/mushroom-soup%3famp) is basically the one I use except I use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock and it turns out great! You can also add basically any herbs or spices that you’d usually eat with mushroom - nutmeg or dill are particular favourites of mine but anything could work.

Perfect with some crusty bread. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Paying back loans counts toward the credit score so paying off your student loans and your small loan and your first mortgage would put you in a very good position.

For people who have never had a loan to pay off (didn’t go to uni, went to uni in Scotland where it’s free) they are left with no credit score at all which can make it difficult to get a mortgage now. If you have no credit score at all an easy way to get a good one is to do what the comments above were saying about the credit cards. However if you’ve already successfully paid off some loans then you probably already have a good credit score and getting a credit card is unnecessary.  </TEXT>

Romeo and Juliet aren’t the people in the wrong. Their families who have been engaged in a blood feud for decades are the ones who caused the story to end in tragedy. If they had been able to get over themselves then a very advantageous marriage between two of the most powerful houses in the state, leaving them both better off politically and with a better relationship with their children, would have happened.

<TEXT> There’s some really good advice here about dating apps and clubs and things so I’m gonna say something different.

This is going to sound really vapid and silly but I’m a bi girl and I’ve had a few girlfriends in the past and I’m being serious. Do you look visibly gay?

Where I live that involves brightly coloured/part shaved hair, flannel and denim jackets with badges and patches (especially pride flag ones!).

Being able to tell if another girl might be gay makes it 100% easier to approach them with romantic intentions which is why there’s a typical look to begin with. If it’s something you feel safe to do adding something to your outfit like a bi pride badge can be the difference between a girl thinking you’re straight and not approaching you and a girl thinking you’re dating material.

Obviously I’m not saying change you’re look entirely!! You have to be yourself that’s the most important thing. But even a little indication of your sexuality can open the door to flirting from girls.  </TEXT>

Yeah I don’t really know enough about it to say whether the NHS is right on this or not. I was just clearing up that it’s not the medically encouraged thing in the uk to get the vaccination.

I think it probably is better to get the vaccine, and you can still get the vaccine privately in the uk. I know is £140 from Boots (that’s two doses - still pretty expensive). The NHS is massively underfunded and things that aren’t life threatening get pushed to the back burner but it’s not as if you can’t get the vaccine here, you just have to pay for it. Shocking for people used to getting most every medical treatment for free but not really that shocking in terms of the rest of the world.

A non-necessary vaccine not being funded by the NHS doesn’t really bother me as I’d rather they spent their limited funding on more important things. Ideally I’d like for them to get more funding so that things like the chickenpox vaccination could be covered but I understand why it’s not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually according to the NHS “The chickenpox vaccine is not part of the routine UK childhood vaccination programme because chickenpox is usually a mild illness, particularly in children.
There's also a worry that introducing chickenpox vaccination for all children could increase the risk of chickenpox and shingles in adults.”

So actually kids aren’t encouraged to get the vaccine and having kids hang out together to spread the chicken pox is pretty normal here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, people will disagree with you on what should be eradicated. You’re stance on mental illness is kind of nonsensical because the human condition is mental illness with circumstances deciding the degree of illness. People with no genetic predisposition can be driven insane and people with family history of mental illness can be totally fine. Because someone’s experience of life is different from yours doesn’t mean you get to say the don’t deserve to live.

Secondly, people Will Not agree to this - the vast majority of people want to have children out of love for their partner and a desire to make a family. So you will have to force people to take part in this which is obviously morally wrong.

And finally, your insistence that THIS time it will be different because in today’s world we’re all so level headed and race isn’t an issue anymore is naïve at best and at worst makes it very clear you are a troll.

If you are sincere please genuinely think about what I’ve said and why other people are downvoting you and arguing against eugenics in the rest of this thread. If you’re a troll congrats for making me put this much energy to you. In any case I’m done with this discussion now and won’t respond further. Have a nice day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In one school that I did work experience in the nursery had teachers with honours degrees as well as teaching assistants that had three year non-honours degrees and the school also had a speech and language therapist who had a masters degree. I’m inclined to think that practically that’s a good way to do it because then each child is being looked after by someone with a high level of education on the subject but not to a point where the school suffers from a shortage of staff.

I could see a two year course covering the position of teaching assistant as long as there was also a qualified teacher available to supervise I guess.

I’m glad that we agree a few years at least are necessary as in other places in this thread people have been suggesting a couple of weeks being enough time to get qualified which is just nuts and disregards the very real skill required for looking after children. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean the most qualified person possible and I do believe there should be a minimum amount of qualification a person should have.

Child development is significantly more complicated than digging a hole and as you have a degree in education I assume you know that and you’re being hyperbolic, but here is a metaphor I think is more apt - if my boiler is faulty I’m sure I could get a qualified professional in but maybe I’d be just as well with a wrench? No way that could go wrong.

With young children especially it is not just about whether a person can understand the coursework that need to be taught to a sufficient level, it’s about the development of the child. Emotional development, language development and the ability to spot any additional needs early on (for example, issues with speech development that can be corrected fairly easily early on with the intervention of a speech therapist but with if left can become far more difficult) are way more important and these skills actually take a significant amount of time to learn. </TEXT>

I understand what you’re saying about expectations, but the fact of the matter is she was not upfront about her relationship status nor HER expectation that he would be okay with it.

Even if he was poly also and she was upfront about being poly, if she had kept those other relationships a secret that would still be a breach of trust.

Whether right or not the standard expectation in our society is that dating has an element of exclusivity and so the onus is on the person with the non-standard dating style to be upfront with that. </TEXT>

If I’m on a night out or a house party, I indulge a bit more. But it’s a choice that I make to get drunk with my friends because it’s someone’s birthday or something, and not just an automatic thing that I do most nights.

<TEXT> But a single person can be a chimera when two fraternal twins fuse fully causing one person to have two sets of dna.

I saw a documentary once about a woman who nearly had her children taken from her because their blood showed she wasn’t their mother, but then she had another baby under surveillance and they tested the blood and found that the baby who they SAW come out of her had the same thing happen.

Turns out she had absorbed her fraternal twin and her blood had one set of dna, but her ovaries had another.

I wonder why that can happen but fraternal conjoined twins can’t? I guess because there ends up being only one blood type etc because the two have fully merged into one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just gave this answer elsewhere in the thread but in case you don’t see it you might find it interesting

‘I just wrote an essay on sociophonetics and I think it’s probably linked. The phonetic values of a persons speech, the way they produce certain noises, can be part of creating a social identity.

In the same way that people will use certain words and sentence structures to indicate that they’re members of a certain group (ie middle class, ‘street’, ‘nerd’, teenager, etc) people produce sounds in certain ways to indicate their group affiliation. This isn’t necessarily a conscious process but is a natural instinct due to humans being highly social pack animals.

So the ‘gay lisp’ may actually be a way for people to create and confirm their social affiliation through phonetics.

:D’ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not being interested in girls isn't a bad thing. Maybe that specific girl isn't his type. Maybe he's gay! All of that's fine and honestly romantic interest shouldn't be important in measuring where a persons at with their life.

As for the rest of it, maybe stop giving him an allowance and tell him that if he wants to buy video games he'll have to get a job. My boyfriend is 23 and really only cares about video games and his car, but he's a manager at our superstore because when he wanted to buy his first car and all of the best new games he had to earn the money for himself.

And I'm not a manager, but getting a part time job alongside doing my degree was in a large part motivated by wanting to buy my own video games. It's a good motivator for people who like to buy the new AAA games when they come out.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys! My boyfriend (not a redditor, sadly) needs people to fill out [this](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/3ZLB5D9) survey for his dissertation. It only takes a minute.

The survey is about employee satisfaction, so please only take it if your currently employed! Thank you in advance, any extra people he can get to take it will make all the difference. </TEXT>

<TITLE> I'm in a healthy BMI in the first time that I can remember </TITLE>

Hi loseit! I haven't made a post here before but a lot of the advice I've seen here has been really helpful to me and I wanted to see if I could maybe return the favour. I hope this post is okay!

I know the legitimacy of BMI is questionable but this is a big step for me and something that I've always felt was wrong with me since I was a young teenager and I've finally cracked it!

While using my fitness pal and having access to the community on Reddit helped me lose a lot, I have to be honest and say that the last 8lbs came off while I was on anti depressants and with therapy.

I'm not suggesting anti depressants as a weight loss cure! But if you're like me, you might be turning to eating as a reprieve from anxiety and depression. For me it was a vicious cycle of "I'm depressed so I eat so I'm fat so I'm depressed". It doesn't have to be that way! If you can get help about your mental health problems, it can have an extreme benificial effect on your physical health problems (like being over weight) and it's worthwhile doing!

Anyway I though this might be helpful to at least someone that reads it. If it's helpful to at least someone (as posts of a similar nature were to me) then it was worth posting. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Guess which bookcase I decluttered </TITLE>

I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while but I found it really hard to get started. I just have so much stuff. And most of it's junk!

But I've got a new bed coming this week so I needed to move the boxes out from under the old one, and I took it as an opportunity to start decluttering. I ended up with four full bin bags and a burning need to declutter more of my room. I got another full bin bag out of the bookshelf on the right, and that's not including all the things I moved to their proper places or the box full of books I've set aside for donation.

I've nearly finished the other bookshelf and then its on to my make up & hair drawers and my wardrobe. So thank you, r/declutter. I've never been this excited to tidy up! </TEXT>

<TEXT> It was great when we were younger but there's only so many times you can watch your uncle hammer a nail up his nose before you stop being impressed, you know? There is a breaking point in a person when they've been shown too many card tricks.

Also once when we were very young my cousin told me that if I gave her my doll she would fill it with magic from the magic box in her house (like the one that all magicians have) and then I would have a magic doll. I never did get it back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Admittedly we're not a huge family but my uncle (a magician) married his first wife (a magician from a family of magicians) and had two kids (both magicians) and then divorced and married his current wife (a magician) and now the kids are grown up and one of them is dating a magician. The magic isnt what started the warring factions but it does tend to be how they fight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> More than half the people there will be magicians.
There is an ongoing feud between two magician factions that make boxing day at granny's house the most stressful day of the year.
Don't - do NOT - let them show you a magic trick because it will start an escalation war that will result in someone trying to saw someone else in half without any intention of putting them back together. </TEXT>
