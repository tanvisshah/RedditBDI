<TEXT> Hi! I'm in the same boat currently. I've only recently been able to pick up writing again. Its possible, but it's not the same. It may never quite be the same, and it was only after I accepted that that I was able to get back into it.

Things change. You've changed. You're writing styles and habits have probably changed too.

Instead of trying to go back to where you left off, how you left, spend some time discovering the new. New styles, new genre, new method. You're more connected to yourself and your emotions now, follow that, see where it may lead you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's right, and not right in away. He definitely could have handled it better, used better words, empathized more, but that doesn't necessarily mean what he said was wrong or meant to put you down in anyway.

If you didn't like it, or if he made you uncomfortable or upset that's okay. You're allowed to not be okay. And you're right that it isn't your fault, you can't control your triggers or how you react to them, but you also can't expect everyone to treat you exactly as you need them to when this happens.

You absolutely can't just stop having PTSD, that's definitely not how it works, but it's still something you can work on. It's hard, and it takes time, but you can minimize your triggers, regulate the way you respond to them, find coping skills to help you maintain your composure in those situations.

You can't just stop having PTSD, but you can get stronger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So technically the only thing they have to do is write a noting stating that you are.disabled and would benefit from having a service dog. But if they want to be more involved in the process there's a few ways to go about it.

Start by doing some research, I believe this thread has some helpful links in the side bar or community info that you can help with. I would also suggest looking at the ADA and ADI websites for more I formation regarding the laws as well as places to start.

Go over your current life style with your psychiatrist. Put together a lost of tasks a SD might be able to do to help you. Consider whether owner training with help from a trainer or going to a program would work best for you situation. How well do you handle confrontation? One huge way my therapist helped me on my journey to getting an SD was by helping work on dealing with confrontations in public.

Beyond that, remember that SDs are a crutch, not a cure. They can only help make symptoms more manageable, and they aren't always reliable. You'll still need to work on continued care and other long term treatments. You're psychiatrist can also help you put together plans for when you won't have a SD to help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're chances of success will be much higher, however there is always a chance of washing out, even with program dogs. It's an unfortunate reality of service dogs, they can wash for any number of reasons, many of which we can't account for.

You'll likely be fine as long as you and your trainer work well together and don't push your dog too hard,  but it's always a good idea to have a back up plan just in case.

Washing is every handlers nightmare, but if you're prepared for it to happen you'll be better off in the long run. Even if it never happens, having that safety net gives you more security in your training. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I'm also incredibly socially awkward and suffer from social anxiety. It's easy to forget how conversations work. Sometimes it helps to go people watching. Its not too uncommon for writers to sit down at cafes with their laptops nor notebooks and just observe the way people interact with each other naturally. I used to do this as well.

You could also watch some shows (I find drama show particularly useful) it's not as organic, but transcribing scenes from shows and movies could also help you ease into writing dialogue and interactions </TEXT>

The FHA covers "assistance animals," not just service dogs. This includes ESAs and SDITs. So even if your dog isn't in training yet you can get them as an ESA first provided you have still have the required letters.

As long as your housing falls under the FHA it shouldn't be much of a problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was there 5 years ago. Locked up in my dorm 24/7 I didn't even leave to eat anymore. It's horrible feeling trapped and empty and alone.

Thing is, there's a niche for everyone out there, some are just harder to find. It took a long time to get here, I'm not gonna lie, but now I have a loving partner and friends I play dnd with on the weekends and talk to on discord when we're free.

It's never too late to make friends. I was already 23 before I met the people I spend most of time time with now. And I'll be well past 40 before I stop making new friends. There's no time limit on building a social circle. There's no due date for having a family. There will always be classmates, coworkers, strangers you can talk to. Some of them you'll make connections with. Many of them you won't. But there are literally billions of people in the world, and I can promise that their are some who will be there for you.

I'm here if you'd like to talk, but I'm notoriously bad at communication. I can't promise I'll always message back, but I can promise I'll always listen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You most certainly could, but I personally know more people who changed their dog's career to an at home SD instead. If the reason they wash is because of PA concerns, but they can task just fine at home then they're still a service dog, they just don't work in public.

ESA, at home SD, and family pet are all valid choices for a service dog that washes out of public access. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most working dogs are born with the instinct and capacity to do their jobs, however it needs to be shaped and trained in order to be done effectively. Otherwise you end up with a dog full of energy and motivation but no direction or output.

This is why working line dogs are generally discouraged for house pets. Without the training and physical exercise of their jobs they find other ways to Express those instincts, often through destructive behavior such as barking, chewing, digging, and in the case of herding dogs, nipping and herding the family. </TEXT>

In the wild though, albino animals do tend to have poorer vision due to being unable to properly regulate the amount of light that enters their eyes, they are also more prone to sunburns. Melanistic animals have a higher risk of over heating in hot environments, and both make for easier prey as they can stand out more depending on their environment. </TEXT>

Oof, I feel this. I've had so many people tell me I put too much into caring for my snake because "it's just a snake itll be fine. It probably doesnt even love you anyway."

<TEXT> Not really. Snakes only really use scent to track the general location of prey, pythons, like the one here, use their heat pits to determine what's food and what isnt. Thats why snake owners need to warm up their food before feeding them. Unless it's a heated blanket or was warm from recent use, its unlikely that it was mistaken for food.

Snakes can also be picky I'm captivity. Ball pythons especiallly, though that's not the kind of snake kn this clip. My ball python wont eat food if it's even a degree too cold, and some have been known to reject food for being the wrong color.

I agree that what probably happened here is they accidentally picked up the blanket while eating something else and just kinda... kept eating. </TEXT>

Most articles written for the public are written from the frame if mind that the public needs to know that they cannot interfere with a working service dog. It's a thing handlers need to deal with way too often so its important to try to educate when the opportunity presents itself.

But dogs are still dogs. They're living creatures, they're not infallible, they need breaks just like everyone else does or theyll get burnt out.

Honestly, I think service dogs are the most spoiled dogs out there. We know how hard they work, and we owe them our lives. I mean I do at least so I try to make sure he lives the happiest life he can in return. I couldnt imagine a service dog handler being cruel to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can start training, but do keep in mind that puppies are puppies, they need time to be a puppy and enjoy themselves.

Your training sessions should be short and fun, focus mostly on basic things like manners and basic obedience. The ground work you'll want to lay will start with recall, "focus" or "look at me" and "leave it" those will set you up for easier training down the line.

Make sure your house is proofed before you bring then home. The best way to break bad habits is to prevent them from forming. Make sure that everything you dont want to be destroyed is picked up and out of the way. Puppies, like babies, tend to explore with their mouths first and everything is on the menu.

For manners, start with bite inhibition and socialization. Introduce them to all kinds of things, strangers, vacuums, fans, cars, anything and everything, but make sure it's fun. Itll help when they to their fear periods.

Other than that. Let them settle in, it can take a while for pups to adjust to a new home so take things slow, especially at the start. I know it's easy to get excited and want to jump straight into things, but going to fast can quickly lead to burn out for both of you. Enjoy having a puppy, let your pup enjoy being a puppy. Take things steadily and you'll be just fine.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Service dogs can and SHOULD do all the things a normal dog does. They are dogs after all, and not allowing themselves to Express or experience that at all is cruel and a quick way to wash out.

Dogs absolutely can be trained to only be in work mode when they're vested, its actually fairly common to do this. My own dog is only in "work mode" when vested. Though he'll still task when "off duty" when necessary. That said, youll still want to have boundaries even when not vested, no scavenging, no aggression etc. Mostly basic dog manners and obedience. It's not necessarily a requirement but it will make things easier for both you and your pup and help reduce chances of washing out due to bad habits.

Also please keep in mind that owner training does not mean training on your own. Even if you have professional experience training working dogs., it is not the same as training a service dog. They have a different set if rules and requirements and you'll definitely still want input from a service dog trainer as you go.

Good luck and I hope you the best! </TEXT>

<TEXT> u/ohhoneyno_ said everything. I only want to reinforce one point. Don't force your dog to work through their fears. For many people it can be hard to tell the difference between forcing and helping, dog language and be subtle and hard to understand. Sometimes shutting down and ignoring the noise is a good thing, sometimes it is very bad and it can be difficult to tell the difference.

"Flooding" is a desensitization technique which consists of continuous exposure to a fear or stressor until their response to it changes. This is often down when taming down snakes or when "breaking" horses. This process is generally not recommended as it can easily go wrong due to variables entirely out of your control, and even if it seems to have worked it's hard to tell if it's because they had learned that the stressor is not a threat and everything is ok or if it's because they've only learned that there is no escape from the situation and have shut down to deal with it.

I am not saying that this is what you are doing, but it is something to be wary of as you progress.

Again, I would also recommend keeping exposure to the sounds short and to make sure that each exposure is a good experience. I would also recommend taking sometime to work on building his confidence in general. Introduce him to harmless new things, make them as fun as possible. Let him explore the things that startle or confuse him as long as it's safe and give him plenty if treats and praise for it. </TEXT>

If you're concerned about the fur style, please be assured that unlike most working dogs who may have double coats and should not be shaved, poodles really do need to have there fur trimmed about once month on average otherwise their fur gets matted and uncomfortable.

The original iconic poodle cut was actually designed with the dog on mind. It was made to help keep them thermoregulated while they were working, shaved in some parts to keep them from over heating, but leaving fur on joints and extremities to protect them from the cold water.

For pet poodles, it doesnt particularly matter how their fur is trimmed so long as they're comfortable in it. In this case I'd say they look pretty comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They also don't really seem to care. The trim style isn't limiting or affecting their motion in anyway, and they dye is most likely pet friendly which washes out. Poodles need to get trimmed regularly anyway, so they'll be back to their normal trim soon. They seem happy enough in these clips.

The only real affect on their life that this has is they'll probably  be getting a bit more attention than usual for a little while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Poodles need to have their fur trimmed regularly anyway, animal safe fur dyes and chalks are readily available on the market, and dogs don't care what they look like as long as they're comfortable. Why not have some fun with it?

The dog seems to be having plenty of fun already. Plus imagine how much attention and and love they'll get come Halloween. Sounds like a win to me.

Edit: However, if they were wearing some sort of costume or were in a situation that they were clearly uncomfortable in or didn't like then I'd totally agree with you, but as it stands this is just some safe fun for everyone. </TEXT>

Idk, if they're still allowing camping, but if you do decide to camp, I've been warned to go ahead and shell out to reserve a quiet spot as the other camping grounds tend to great really rowdy.m, keeping the parties going until 4am, if they settle down at all.

I might be able to dig through my contacts for some vendors who live on the TRF grounds and send you their way for more advice, but I cant promise instill have their info unfortunately.

<TEXT> If you'd like to speak to the store manager/owner on their behalf, try to be diplomatic. Usually these things happen because they're uninformed, not due to any real discrimination.

Explain to them that your friend had a service dog and that legally they are allowed to enter any areas open to the public (provided it isnt hazardous to do so) regardless of store policy. If they have any questions or arguments feel free to direct them to the ADA website, remind them that denying access is discrimination, and assure them that they still maintain the right to ask a service dog to leave the property if it is being disruptive, destructive or is generally not under the control of their handler/trainer.

Sometimes it helps to have the ADA handy, either on your phones or printed out. Sometimes people like to see the proofs themselves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My dog looks like a rottweiler. We get screams, children crying, "devil dog" on one occasion.

It unfortunately really is something you just need to be able to get over. It's not you're fault they're scared. Your dog isnt the one that caused them trauma. It honestly is more their problem than it is yours, but you cant force people to change for you.

If someone gets upset because they're afraid of my dog, I just say "sucks" and move on, because that's really the only thing you can do. If parents ask nicely I let their crying child pet him so they can learn not to be afraid, but otherwise it really isnt my problem.

This was something I had to steel myself against for years before I even considered getting a service dog. My doctors wouldnt sign off on it until I had my anxiety in order enough to confront these sorts of things because it comes with the territory. If I was going to have a dog with me everywhere I needed to be able to face the conflict that comes with it. It sounds like that may be something you'll have to do as well. </TEXT>

That said, I have a sharp turn when walking, and always turn stepping out my right foot (a habit picked up from marching band.) Turning left isn't a problem, since my dog heels on my right, he gets plenty enough warning of where we're headed, however when I turn right, if I dont give him a heads up I end up kicking him.

Edit for more info. If I'm on the phone and cant give a verbal cue, my dog is also trained for nonverbal cues (also a good thing to train just in case.) But if I cant cue at all he still follows in a heel, I just feel bad of I accidentally kick him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In my home state I haven't had many problems honestly. There are a lot of working dogs here for farm work and hunting, so most parents are pretty good about making sure their kids know not to approach strange dogs.

I do however, get a lot of teens barking at us in stores. Which is.... fine I guess. It's a bit annoying, but  at least not disruptive.

The worst thing is pictures. So far it's only happened twice, but those are are definitely the most frustrating for me. Once a lady took pictures of my boy talking while I was on the floor. Like, I'm suffering down here, you think ya could help instead maybe? The second time was some girl following us around the store so I made it a point to make sure that either I or my partner were between them so she couldnt get any clear shots. Eventually her dad caught her and apologized.

The most awkward though was at a store our of town I frequent. This one kid takes it upon himself to pet my dog withoutasking, directly in front of me. The first time I was too confused to do anything. The second time I kinda just grabbed his hand and held it until it got really awkward and he left. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if you meant to say "eyes" but just in case:

Yes, these deer are most likely leucistic, however albinism isnt restricted to just red eyes. It presents itself differently in different species depending on genetics.

Rodents like mice and rats do not have Gene's for any eye color except brown, so albino rodents have pink or red eyes. However, animals like dogs, cats, and even humans can have different pigement in their eyes as well, so albino specimens of those species may have pale blue, tawny, or even lilac colored eyes instead of red.

A more accurate way to determine whether an animal is albini vs leucistic is by looking at their over all body color. Albino animals entirely lack melanin across their entire body where as leucism is only a partial loss. Leucistic animals may have fade colors, or bits of color usually on their lips, around their eyes, or on their paw pads. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Work up to jump scares I think would be a good plan of action.

You could try starting smaller, like those trick candy bowls with the hands in them that grab you.

Sudden movements like that are always going to be a bit startling for anyone, but the more you desensitize your pup to them ahead of time the better off you'll be.

You could also try having someone go ahead of you to trigger it before hand and train that way to get your pup used to the jump scare from a distance.

Sometimes just hanging out around the spooky thing can help. It really boils down to how your dog processes things herself.

But regardless of how you go about working on this, make sure to keep a close eye on them and back off if they look uncomfortable. If something happens and they do get a big startle, just do what you can to help them recover from it as quickly as possible whether that be treats and praise, or letting her explore the scare on her own terms.

My dog always feels better after he gets the chance to sniff whatever it was that spooked him.

While I'm here though, I'm not sure i f you're already working on it, but definitely prepare your dog for people screaming randomly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe any dog has the **potential** to be a service dog, but it does take a specific kind of individual to actually be able to the job.

Many dogs have personalities that clash directly with service work. They're too anxious, too timid, too aggressive, too independent, too energetic, not energetic enough. There's a plethora of reasons a dog may not be cut out for service work and quite specific things that are absolutely necessary for service work depending on what their job is going to be, and that can be different for everyone.

Many of these traits can be worked on or trained, others are engrained into your dog's personality. In the end, if your dog is unable or unwilling work be it due to health concerns or simply not likin their job, then they shouldn't be forced to.

You can absolutely train your dog to be a service dog, but please keep in mind that washing out is entirely a possibility and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. If at any point you end up needing to wash that does not make you or your dog a failure.

I hope you the best of luck. </TEXT>

However, that does not always make it the best option. Deciding why, when and how to get a service dog should be done on a case by case basis. Every situation is different and there are pros and cons for either side.

<TEXT> While I agree with you an every other front, I'll have to politely disagree with you regarding enclosure size. There's never anything wrong with giving any animal more room to explore so long as it is set up properly. With ball pythons that means giving them plenty of hiding spaces, and permeable objects they can go through or underneath so they can stay hidden while traveling. As long as there's little to no open/barren space that would leave them feeling exposed they'll be just as happy in a large enclosure while also giving them more opportunity stretch their muscles. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The general rule of thumb for enclosure size is that your snake should be able to stretch out fully along at least one side.

On top of what's been said about general care, snakes are pretty skittish animals. They dont usually feel very comfortable in open spaces. Levi would probably be happy to have more clutter in his tank, fake plants, rocks, logs, anything he can slither through or under would be great.

Also, if you have a screen top it might be difficult to keep humidity up consistantly without spraying down  regularly. You may want to use a pane of glass/foil/towel over a part of the screen to help keep humidity in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! Though snakes try not to strike whenever possible, their venom is a valuable resource to them since that's how they get food.

All snakes will generally give some kind of threat display before striking to give you plenty of time to notice them and back off.

Handling a venomous snake this way is irresponsible and strongly recommended against. </TEXT>

Getting better is a process. A lot of the time it feels like you're not getting anyway or arent going to get anywhere and it's easy to give up on. But as long as you're taking steps forward no matter how tiny or insignificant, you'll get there.

It's hard, I know, every day is a struggle, but I do genuinely hope you the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with the others that aversive training techniques and tools should be avoided whenever possible, however if you do need to use either of these please make sure you know how to use them correctly to prevent 1) injury and 2)negatively affecting your dog's progress


Between the two, if you are using them to fortify a proper heel, the ecollar, on a setting where it can be felt but is not harmful, uncomfortable or frightening to your dog, can be used in much the same way a clicker or cue would be used either to request attention or to mark for good behavior. Used this way the Ecollar can also be a tool for distance training.

However, when used in this way, the ecollar is ***NOT*** a punishment. It should  be a positive experience and associated with rewards and fun, not with punishment or failure.

Either way, when introducing any training tool its important to know how to use them properly and you should speak to your trainer about it before moving forward. Not only will a trainer be able to show you how to use such tools correctly, but they are also better able to assess how introducing the tool may affect or is affecting your dog. </TEXT>

<TEXT> She's at about that age where dogs tend to "forget" their training. People usually have to do a "soft restart* at around 12-18 months of age when their dogs go through adolescence.

You may need to take a step back and retrain some manners before going forward again. If you keep trying to continue correcting as you go rather than taking the time to slow down and rework on basics you may end up burning your dog out.

Dont be discouraged, training takes a long time and a lot of times going backwards is a part of going forward. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a way, yes. I know this zoo well. They take good care of their animals. They're AZA accredited meaning they have to hold high standards for the care of the animals. Any signs of animal cruelty and their accredation would be revoked.

That said, all of their animal interactions must be done on a purely voluntary basis for the animals. They're always given the opportunity to refuse or stop and are respected when they do.

Axelle in particular is known to be feistier and enjoys.play more than her siblings and I wouldnt doubt if they added this feature entirely for her own enjoyment, but if she wasn't up to it that day her keepers would never push the issue.

I agree with this sub on the other posts. I even would have agreed with the SA zoo being posted here before they got their accredation. But these people have worked so hard to do better, they put so much love and care into the welfare of the animals in their care as well as the animals in their reintroduction program. They are actively fighting to undo the damage the human race, and even their own establishment, have done in the past and they are working hard still to continue improving both their own husbandry as well as what nature habitats are left in Texas.

Many zoos and animal entertainment are cruel, but not *this* one. And I hate to see a genuinely good establishment being slandered as animal cruelty.

The San Antonio Zoo worked hard to earn their AZA Accredation and would never force their animals to do something they didn't want to. They've been expanding their habitats for YEARS now and are still working on making them bigger and better in anyway possible.

I live near by, I've seen first hand just how much effort they've put into bettering their ways. Not only have they greatly increased their care for their animals physically, mentally and emotionally, they're also working on reintroducing many native populations back into the wild through their conservation programs which is funded by the people who go to the zoo for their entertainment.

<TEXT> I've been putting some of this information in replies to other comments, but if anyone wants to know.

This is Axelle of the San Antonio Zoo! Her and her siblings were named by, and after, the Spurs' Tony Parker. They do this voluntarily as a game, and are not forced to do so by their keepers.

The SA Zoo is AZA accredited, meaning they follow a set of guidelines made to guarantee they are caring for their animals to the best of their abilities. They've
done a lot to gain that accredation including expanding their habitats immensely, and providing more enrichment such as this game of tug of war, and they are still growing, building bigger, better homes for the animals in their care.

They have many other interactive events through out the zoo such as breakfast with their giraffes, as well as many open walk through enclosures.

The zoo itself also has their own conservation program working toward reintroducing native species back to the wild.

I really admire how much they've grown. When I first went over 20 years ago, their enclosures were miserable concrete cells. Now, what you see in this video is only a fraction of what's available to those lions, and they are continuing to improve their practices at every given opportunity.

Their efforts towards conservation and reintroduction, as well as the continued care of the animals and future improvements, are funded by the public buying tickets, enjoying their interactive animals events, donations, and their "adopt a zoo animal" program.

Please consider visiting them if you're ever in the area.

Edit to add that Axelle is on their adopt an animal program </TEXT>

<TEXT> The San Antonio Zoo!

It's a great place, takes great care of their animals, and are currently upgrading a lot of their habitats!

Fair warning though. 1) the lions arent always io for tug. 2) they just recently got their AZA accredation and you can still see a lot of the old zoo enclosures near the front entrance. They've grown and changed A LOT since then, over doubling in size just to make room for better homes for the animals in their care and they're still constructing better, bigger habitats for them.

I STRONGLY recommend you stop by if you ever get the chance. Juuust not during summer. Texas gets pretty hot. But if you do go during summer show up early before the sun gets too hot and start at the back of the zoo and work your way back to the front. You'll avoid most of the crowd and can enjoy the outside exhibits before it gets too hot and get into the AC during noon/afternoon.

Sorry for the essay. I'm just super proud of this zoo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That too, but the lions do this entirely voluntarily. The zookeepers likely introduced the game themselves as just that. A game. They shows the lions that the rope is a toy, probably with many treats involved, and encourage this interaction as a good thing with plenty of treats during and after so it remains a fun experience.

The important thing is that they are in control of the situation and can leave at anytime they want and arent forced to do this for the publics sake.

<TEXT> This depends very much on your partner, their disability, and how their service dog will be aiding them.

Regardless though, you will not be that the dog's favorite person. That's not to say they wont love you, but the most important person to a service dog should be their handler.

In my case, I'm at minimal risk at home. Over got plenty of tools to aid me and my partner to help if my dog can't, so my dog has more liberties than some. He loves my partner and has his own bond with them. I'm still the one he follows from room to room unless I tell him otherwise, but he will still snuggle up to my partner, ask them for pets and food, and comfort them when they're upset so long as I am not in crisis.

Honestly, talk to your partner about it. Theyll be able to tell you more than anyone what boundaries you should be following and what you both can expect in the future. So many situations depend on the individual handler and how they're affected by their disabilities and how their service dog helps them, it's hard to give any real advice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right. Eh... kinda? Dogs dont smile in the same way humans do (teeth bared) but they do have similar expressions used to convey the same emotions. This is especially prominent in dogs with wider heads like pitbulls as looking at their "happy face" head on does actually make it look incredibly similar to a human smile.

In this case, the face this dog is making is very indicative if their emotional state. They're excited. They feel like they're in a safe environment. They're anticipating something good to happen to them. You can actually understand the emotional state of this dog by taking the time to read their body language. Including how tense their eyes are, how their ears are held and how their lips are shaped. (Their facial expression)

Anthropomorphism can be dangerous. It often leads to misinformation, as you said, BUT that doesn't mean that we cannot learn to read animals' body language and how they can be portraying how the animals feel, similarly to how we would with other people.

Just because animals Express emotions differently doesnt mean they dont express them at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some friends are only around for the parts of your life they enjoy. Some friends are around until something changes. Some friends fade away and love moves on, people drift, what you want changes, who you enjoy changes. Some friends are around for a life time.

It sounds like you've had a major shift in your lifestyle. That usually comes with a major shift in who you keep as company. If you're having trouble making friends the same way, it may be because those kinds of people arent quite who you click with anymore, or you've gotten too used to yourself.

It is a part of growing up, but only in the sense that things change. Growing up doesnt mean you dont have friends anymore. It doesnt mean you spend weekends alone, or dedicate yourself only to those still with you.

I won't say you're doing anything wrong either. It sounds like you're just adjusting. Still figuring some stuff out. And that's just fine. Try to think about everything that's changed, why, what you like and dont like about it, what you liked and didn't like about your old life style and old friends, and consider how that might affect your state of mind now.

Plus vet bills which ended up over $700 within the first few months because I didn't know he was allergic to certain foods. I pay about $70 a month for food, plus $10 a week for dental chews, and variable amounts of money for his training treats. Plus $50 sessions with our trainer every week for a year?

So that's what? About $5,500 for just our first year? And I went the "cheap route" owner training a rescue that was already practically an adult, where the shelter paid for all of his vaccines and first month of behavior evaluation.

I arguably cut as many corners as possible (all of which I wouldnt recommend) and it still cost me a pretty penny. </TEXT>

Depending on local laws they may be considered as dogs, or they may be considered wolves regardless of how diluted their heritage is, which would make them not covered under the legal definition of a service dog in the US.

In some areas, if a wolf dog bites anyone or their pets they may be ordered to be put down and sent for testing as there isn't a complete understanding as to how the rabies virus and vaccine affect them. </TEXT>

My first therapist just told me to put my faith in God and forgive the people who hurt me and well o viously I didn't want to. That anger kept me alive for a long time, and what they did shaped so much of who I am now. I'm not just gonna pretend it's all better now.

My last therapist was the good one. He helped me sit down and work through my feelings, where they were coming from and why so that I could find better ways to cope with them. And he provided with tools to help me control my panic attacks.

You have options, and if one methodndoesnt work you dont have to stick with it until it does. Just try something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't mind my asking, what region of the world do you live in and what kind of zoos have you seen?

I understand where the hate it coming from. Zoos can be pretty bad. The near me used to keep all their animals in basically 10ft by 10ft cement cells. And there are plenty of roadside zoos that just keep them in chain link kennels and feed all of them dog food.

But not all zoos are like that, and in fact many of them have made the change to put their animals physical, psychological and emotional welfare first and foremost. Guaranteeing them the [five freedoms](https://www.animalhumanesociety.org/health/five-freedoms-animals) at the absolute minimum.

The zoo I was talking about worked hard to earn their AZA acredation. Their cheetah enclosure now is amazing. Built straight into a cliffside and filled with foliage for the cheetah to escape into. When I went he was lounging in the center of it and he was barely a speck to me. It was incredible to see how much they expanded (and still are expanding) to make their animals happy. Plus all their animals are captive bred or rescues now. Not taken from their native home, but either saved from bad situations or raised with the hopes of reintroducing native populations someday. Often working in tandem with those African conservations for the betterment of the wilderness.

I would love to see more animals out in their native habitat undisturbed by humans. I would love to see them taking their homes back. And zoos are playing a vital part in that dream now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Zoos have changed a lot lately. Especially western ones. Under the AZA many zoos have made great improvements for the care and safety of the animals to provide them the best life possible.

Enclosures have been made larger, remember that what you see as a visitor is only a fraction of the total amount of space they have. They're given even more space in the back where they can escape from public viewing if they so choose. They're provide regular veterinary checks ups and immediate access or emergency medical care. And they're provided tons of enrichment through toys, games, various food items and training. Everything AZA zoos do is for the benefit of the animals in their care, and they are always improving.

Not to mention the contributions zoos have made to animals living in the wild as well. Zoos are responsible for the reintroduction of animals to 5heir native habitat like the Californian condor and black footed ferret bringing both back from the  rink of extinction.

Zoos are different now. Not all of them are bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'll be honest, I wasn't all that scared or sad when I was prescribed my first meds. I was relieved. For me it wasn't so much "I can't believe i need meds to get better" as it was "I cant believe I finally have a way to start getting better." Maybe you could try thinking of it that way instead? This is your first step to feeling better again.

I wasn't put on prozac, so I cant help you there specifically I'm sorry. But do try to keep track of how it makes you feel and how it affects you, maybe keep a journal of it, and tell your doctor everything about it so that they can adjust your dosage or change prescription as necessary.

If it doesnt work, or makes things worse, talk about it, but dont feel bad. It doesnt make you a failure or a hopeless case. There are tons of causes for depression and tons of meds to treat it, but they all work differently and chances are your depression and the meds youre put on may not mesh very well, and that's just fine. It's just a part of the process unfortunately.

Best of luck to you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I agree that animals should remain in their natural habitat wherever possible. Many zoos have progressed far beyond a state if being a prison for animals. In America, the AZA ensures that any zoo or aquarium accredited by their organization are being given the best care they possibly can from housing and husbandry, to physical and mental wellness.

Please do not discredit the amount of effort zoos have put into keep critically endangered species alive and to reintroducing threatened species back to the wild. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really does depend on him and what he expects of the dog. My current partner and I share the responsibility if caring for my SD, and they have an excellent bond together. They're the one he goes to when he wants to play because I'm too frail for his favorite games (tug and chase).

However, I am still his handler. While my partner may take the lead if I can't step up that day, I'm still his favorite person, and he will still follow me if I leave the room unless I tell him it's ok otherwise or seek me out if he needs anything.

Talk to your partner about it. Ask them what they want they're relationship to be like with the dog and how they would like you to fit into that dynamic. Ask how you can help, and what kind of interactions are allowed and when. But If they ultimately decide that they should be the only one bonded to their service dog, respect that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just a quick word of warning, just because it worked for someone else doesnt necessarily mean it will work for you. Try your best during training not to compare yourself to your friend.

That said, training really depends on the individual. Different dogs will learn at different places, and the most important thing is to not go too fast.

Training usually takes about 2 years, but may take longer depending on the team. At 8 weeks old you should be focused on socializing, basic manners, and building confidence. Things like introducing them to new things and people and teaching then how to interact with the world like what is or isnt appropriate.

When they've gain more confidence and have started figuring things out you can start building your foundation in basic obedience. Take it step by step from there and work with a trainer who will be able to tell you when you're ready for the next step and how to approach it so you and your dog dont get burnt out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately, cats don't really cry for the same reasons we as humans do. Their tears a trigger by environmental stimuli, not emotional stimuli. She was most likely crying due to having dusty litter, or is suffering some upper respiratory problems due to whatever situation she was saved from.

That said though, the emotions conveyed here are still accurate. She was likely distraught from having lost her kittens, and then incredibly happy to have a little baby she could love.

Anthropmorphising animals is misleading and can be dangerous, however that does not mean animals don't have or express emotions. It's just a but different than the way we do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been trying to teach my dog to hold things in this mouth. He usually either bites them in half or spits it out immediately.

Well we finally got him to carry something while at the pet store (the only time he cares about actually grabbing things with his mouth) and it was great! I was so excited. He got so much praise and we bought whatever he picked up. And he brought his new chews to all the employees so they knew what a good boy he was.

Unfortunately, my partner took a while to pay and now he thinks we won't open doors for him unless he drops everything on the floor.

Edit because I just remembered more. My dog knows that he's not a lot to take other's food. Usually he just hovers around the food bowl until whoever is eating finishes and tries to vacuume up the crumbs. However, he found out that our neighbor's dog prioritizes play over their chews. So now when his friend has a bone he wants he'll playbow and dart across the yard until they chase him. He's much larger and out runs them easily so once he's lured them to the other side of the yard he races back across and scoops up his prize. </TEXT>

Not all cats are sociable or motivated enough enjoy training, training  needs to be done more on their terms and may be conducted a bit differently than how you might train most other animals. Some cats may enjoy training, but might not task reliably of their own volition or without a bribe.

Yes, it is possible, but much like with service dogs, you'll need the right prospect and plenty of help especially if you've never trained an animal before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like a service dog may not be the best route for you. Please don't take this as any offense to you, but you have a lot of caveats that need to be worked around that could hinder a service dogs ability to do their job.

Mobility tasks as best done by larger dogs. While smaller dogs can do things like retrieval tasks, it would be hard for then to pass them to you unless you're already sitting or near their height. They would also struggle to do things like open and close doors.

Service dogs shouldn't act on their prey drive to begin with, and it is possible for dogs (service dogs or nor) to share spaces with smaller animals. My own service dog loves to watch my rats scurry around on occasion, but you should still be ready to intercede at any moment. Dogs can slip up. Even the best trained best bred dogs can slip up now and then especially when asking them specifically to go against their instincts. Again, it is possible, but you should still be careful.

Part of what comes with getting a service dog is getting a dog. That means all the responsibilities that come with caring for a normal dog, put on top maintenance and continued training and you'll have a pretty full plate. If you are not currently able to carry out the basic tasks and dog care (walking, grooming, feeding, cleaning up after them, mental excersize) then how are you going to care for a service dog?

That isn't to say its entirely off the table. There are always ways to make things work, but it often comes with sacrifices. You could hire a dog Walker and adjust your tasks to the size of dog you get for example, but one costs money and the other means you may not have all the tasks you need.

Of course I cannot tell you whether a service dog would work for you. I'm only providing an opinion based on the information you've given. You're best bet is to speak to your doctor about it as they know you and your situation far more than I do and would be able to provide you better guidance. And again, I do not mean anything I say as an attack on you or as an attempt to dissuade you from getting a service dog. It's just some input to consider moving forward.

To answer your title question though, it sounds like a standard poodle may be your best bet. They're used often for service work and are less likely to trigger allergies and they're large enough to do the tasks you asked about like retrieving items you dropped, bringing your cane, opening and closing doors. </TEXT>

Equally amazing (though my own personal favorite) is the Russian wolfhound aka Borzoi aka long bois. They are also freakishly tall, but have the added benefit of looking vaguely ethereal.

Edit to add that my dog loves other dogs and loves grandpas so I like to think he thought of the Irish wolfhounds as grandpa dogs and was just so excited because he never thought something could be 2 of his favorite things at the same time. </TEXT>

Leviticus 11: 9-12 *These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat. And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: they shall be even an abomination [unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcasses in abomination. Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.*

Leviticus 19: 19 *You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle engender with a diverse kind: you shall not sow your field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come on you.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone had great input about your shading, but it will also help if you consider your color palette ad a whole.

Every color interacts with other differently, and you can use that to your advantage. Consider what features you want to pop out more or draw attention to and what parts you want featured only in the background or to blend together. Using complimentary (opposite) colors will make your art more dynamic and using analogous (neighboring) colors will make it look more cohesive.

For example in your first piece, using purple shadows and a purple tinted back ground will make the yellow seem even brighter. Or in the second picture if you shaded his back with blues the shadows would look even darker and he would feel more cohesive as a part of the same piece instead of a second piece added to the foreground.

Edit: I'd love to write you a whole deal about color theory and choosing color pallets to really get you where you're headed, but I'm at work right now so it's kinda hard to type out. Feel free to message me though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dogs are social learners! They learn a lot by interpreting social cues and copying others, however they're often not the best problem solvers on their own.

They can learn a whole lot by watching people and other animals, but they have a hard time developing new skills to figure things out on their own.

For example, my dog learned how to open doors with door hinges on his own by following me and my partner around. But when we moved to a house with a lot of sliding doors he kept insisting they open the same way he just wasn't trying hard enough. It wasn't until the past year or so after we taught him he  could move things with his nose that he figured them out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I dont mean to rain on your parade, and if a schnauzer works out for you that's great! But terriers make for notoriously bad SDs. They're great for sport work, and K9 units, but that's mainly due to their prey drive which is something you definitely would not want in an SD.

Also terriers, while not built for speed the same way sight hounds are, are not really built for bearing weight either making quite risky from them to be used as mobility dogs.

They could be great for things like scent based alerts and allergy detection because of their well developed noses, but not so great for use as a secondary support aid unfortunately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Need before breed goes both ways. While a good service dog can potentially come from any breed, if you have a higher chance of success with a dog that may not be high on your list they should he considered very seriously. However, if you intend to go with an odder breed, be prepared for a long wait and have a trainer/behaviorist on hand to help you find a good prospect.

>it makes me uncomfortable and when the dog is doing normal dog things like walkies

This is concerning. I'm not sure I understand you correctly though, so please clarify of you can. But all dogs are going to do normal dog things. Regardless of breed. Even the most lightly work driven dogs and well trained dogs need to do normal dog things. They're dogs. Normal walks where they're not working or training are good for them. Meeting new people and new dogs is good for them. If you are uncomfortable with this an SD be not be right for you.

Yes. Most herding breeds have problems about picking their handlers emotions, which makes them a hard choice especially for PSDs. GSDs and beaucerons are no exception, and the often channel your discomfort into over protectiveness.  However, rough and smooth collies dont exhibit those tendencies are much and are often recommended for service work. If you would like a herding breed I would recommend starting there.

If you need mobility aid avoid sigh hounds like vizlas and weimeraners. Even if you're lighter weight, they have fragile skeletons, their spines especially, and are not made to bear any form of weight like that. Also on that lost are borzoi, great Danes, grey hounds and Irish wolfhounds.

I'm a bit biased against ACDs, I personally just dont like them, but also the only ACD I've ever met was an SD that should have been washed years ago. She openly growls at people when working and has been known to attack men and other dogs. They are also prone to over protectiveness and are definitely higher energy.

Rotties can be notoriously difficult to train. They're "stubborn" but if you find the right trainer to help and a well motivated dog they may suite your needs. The bigger issue would be public access as they're still stigmatized in many places as being highly aggressive and the breed has been banned from most housing.

I dont mean to be at all discouraging. And if you want to move forward with any of these breeds you certainly can, it would just take more work and more time than going with the standard lab/golden/poodle. All in all though if you want a herding breed with high chances of making a successful service dog I highly highly recommend going with a rough/smooth collie. They are work motivated, have the brains of most herding dogs, but without being quite as high strung or prone to channeling your energy into inappropriate outlets. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to the zoo for my birthday last year. I highly recommend calling ahead, and stopping by the visitor center before you enter. Someone may be able to tell you the best route to take to avoid large crowds, where good resting areas are and places for your dog to relieve themselves and any alternative routes if you have trouble climbing

Zoos may also ask you to provide your Sdit's information so they can tell their keepers what to be on the look out for. I didn't go to Houston, but I did go to the zoo in San Antonio, I don't know hos different they are but aside from a steep incline it was incredibly accessible and service dog friendly.

&#x200B;

Keep an eye on your dog though. The crowd plus all kinds of weird animals might be a bit overwhelming. Make sure to step away from any enclosures if they show any signs of stress or over stimulation. </TEXT>

But melanistic lions have never been observed in captivity or in the wild and while there have been sightings and recorded cases of black tigers there is no verifiable proof that they had "true melanism" as tigers are known to change their stripes as they age.

<TEXT> The majority of problems in training are caused by doing too much too quickly and pushing too hard. Like blachly said, she is a *puppy* the only thing you should be focusing on right now is socialization and manners. She has plenty of time to grow up and learn tasks.

As it stands I usually advise against training an SD when living with family unless they are all very understanding and supportive and willing to listen to you. Your pup is young and can recover from any misbehavior right now, she hasn't even fully developed her personality yet, but if you do not put your foot down with your family then you will have problems in the future.

For right now, slow down and put away the spray bottle. Redirect her play biting to appropriate outlets. Continue removing yourself when she does bite you. And work on increasing her confidence and socializing. The more positively she associates with new experiences the better chances she has as a prospect.

And when I say slow down I mean it. Start entirely over if you need to. Don't even get into basic obedience training if she isnt ready for it yet. Training is a process. It takes *years*. You have time, and moving too quickly will only burn you both out.  Slow down. </TEXT>

This form of leucism can also be called piebaldism. It's the complete lack of pigmentation on patches of the body.

Theres other forms of leucism such as just a reduction of the pigmentation present which may cause "faded"coloration. Or a lack of certain kinds of pigmentation. Or an entirely white animals that retains certain areas of pigement such as their lips, paw pads and/or eyes. Leucism may also sometimes be called partial albinism.

Edit to add more fun facts. Other animals that often display piebaldism are cattle, snakes, horses, and the spotting on dalmatians is due to the piebald gene. </TEXT>

If you can, try to find someone you can speak to about what happened, preferably a therapist or counselor if theres one available to you.

Going through and getting any kind of trauma is a process that can be difficult to understand and lead to your mind doing many strange things. Having someone to talk to about it or keeping a journal can help you through it.

You dont have to think anything I'm particular about your dream. You're allowed to think or feel whatever you do about it. You may have more dreams like that in the future, but whatever may happen in them is not necessarily a reflection of yourself or what you want. They often be a lot like intrusive thoughts that way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This form of leucism can also be called piebaldism. It's the complete lack of pigmentation on patches of the body.

Theres other forms of leucism such as just a reduction of the pigmentation present which may cause "faded"coloration. Or a lack of certain kinds of pigmentation. Or an entirely white animals that retains certain areas of pigement such as their lips, paw pads and/or eyes. Leucism may also sometimes be called partial albinism.

Edit to add more fun facts. Other animals that often display piebaldism are cattle, snakes, horses, and the spotting on dalmatians is due to the piebald gene. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can agree, my dog is still figuring out how to interact with our neighbors frenchie Paco. He was confused the first time they met because this "thing" in his mind had no tail and grunted at him constantly. He seemed to understand they were a friend of some sort, but couldnt figure things out from there.

Its been a few months, and they've figured out how to play chase together, but Paco stops as soon as my dog starts barking because he has a deep voice that often sounds "angry" to other dogs. Then they both just stand around confused until someone else initiates play again.

They're getting there, but it's a process. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We've made a few cry, and made at least either quit their job or get fired. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The more fun story is my geometry teacher for brevity I'll call him Mr. G. It was a mixed freshman/sophomore class (grade 9 and grade 10 if that helps anyone). A few stories, not from strictly my class but from all the classes he taught that year. Of course there was the standard vandalism, disrupting class, mocking etc. But then people start getting creative.

One day, while Mr. G was watching the hallways before class started, my classmates grabbed all the desks and created a barracade so he couldnt get back in. Another time they started a mosh pit. Another time they managed to sneak all the classroom furnishings outside. All three of these times I resigned myself to napping on the floor. Other stories include sticking pads (hopefully unused) to the wall, setting his desk on fire, peeing in the trashcan, leaving bad reviews online on his self published book, putting (hopefully unused) tampons in his morning soda, stealing his curriculum book, covering the wall behind his desk in ketchup, hacking his work computer, flipping his projector upside-down and possibly finding him on WoW and continuing the harassment there.

I did not participate in the shenanigans myself as I am not a morning person, it was me second class of the day, and I simply did not have the energy to be a rabble rouser. My partner however did participate and even incited a few of these incidents, namely the computer hacking and setting his desk on fire. I did not know them at the time, but its something we talk about occasionally and they claim Mr. G deserved it because he regularly creeped on out female classmates. I dont know if that true, if it wasn't already evident. I wasn't particularly lucid throughout high school.

Of course, this wasn't the first time, nor was it the last, that students in our school district made teachers quite their job. My older brother's class also made a few teachers cry and leave, and many of the younger generations have as well since I've graduated. This was just the norm for us. Heck, I was considered one of the nicest students and I accidentally started 2 riots.

Edit: on my lunch break I'll ask my partner what other nonsense they got up to in that class and which incident they think actually led to him quitting/getting fired. They remember more than I do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is entirely possible to train IPO without using any aversive or abusive methods and it is entirely possible to train a police dog without making them highly aggressive  and it is entirely possible to not use K9's to subdue a suspect with today's technologies.

This is why I dislike most police K9 units. Because all of these things are possible, but they choose to do it the bad way instead.

There is a single police K9 in my town, I know the handler personally. They both suck. The dog is highly aggressive towards other dogs (Including the 2 pet dogs shares a home with) and his trainer used outdated training methods and had him "certified" through one of those online service dog scam sites. He even choked out my own service dog trying to get him to drop something and then told me I needed better training because the bottle got stuck on his lip when he let it go. This guy spent $10,000 importing a working line pedigree dog and ruined him.

I can't speak for the state of law enforcement in America. We're a mess. But I do know I've seen dogs that only growl when they're told to, that release the second they hear down, that skid to stop mid sprint when they've been recalled, and that don't give a false alert just to get treats. Police need to do better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Smooth and rough collies are usually recommended as one of the fab four for service dogs. They do well in service work, and while they may not he as common as poodles, labs and goldens, they are growing in number.

Border collies, while certainly intelligent and work driven are generally advised against. They're incredibly high energy, which makes them great for field work but not so great for settling down for hours on end during work or school the way a service dog would be expected to. On top of that, they tend to be very in tune with their handlers, again great for herding not so great for service work. Especially for psychiatric service dogs, it often translates to them becoming just as anxious as their handlers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure what stories you're looking for, but here are some of my least favorite interactions with the public.

I never really get many people that try to pet my SD which is great, but there is this one kid (teenager really) at a shop I used to frequent that just reached out and scratched his head while I was staring at him and I was like. "Please don't." The next time I went back he tried it again so I kinda panicked and just reached out and held his hand and it was really awkward.

Another time I went to an antique store and this other kid (also a teen?) Started just following me around the shop. It was weird, she had her phone out the entire time and I was sure she was trying to take pictures which is also weird.

Once I was in an air port, doing pretty poorly and had to sit on the floor so my SD could do his job easier. Some old lady start taking pictures of me just suffering on the ground because my dog is cute I guess? I just hope those dont end up anywhere. I was a right mess and couldn't do anything to stop it at the time.


We also get barked at a lot? Not by other dogs. Just by random people and I don't understand why? Why?Why would go bark at a service dog team? What does anyone get out of that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It wasn't exactly a choice.

I made a game out of suicide because I couldn't care anymore. Every night I popped more and more pills. I wanted to see how close I could get to dying. The answer was pretty damn.

I took 4x my prescribed dose of tranqs (which my mother hide from me) plus just handfuls of whoever I found around the house. That night it was light I could feel my self shutting down. Couldn't breathe. My heart beat was so slow. Everything was cold. Everytime I closed my eyes it was like everything stopped and I had to force myself to inhale. I managed to stay awake through the whole ordeal and I'm sure of I fell asleep I wouldnt have woken up.

After that I was terrified of everything. Turns out being in fight or flight mode 24/7 is exhausting. I would either pass out or have panic attacks randomly throughout the day. I didn't have the energy to try anymore.

Eventually my friends got me out of my house. Moved me somewhere away from my parents. My partner never gave me an opportunity to hurt myself again. I got a therapist then a psychiatrist. I was prescribed meds, then an ESA and now a Service Dog.

In a way I feel trapped now. I have my own place with my partner, bills and rent to pay, animals to take care of, and now a garden I've started growing. But at least now I'm glad to have these things, I have something to keep going for. I'm doing something I'm proud of myself for.

I didn't choose to live 5 years ago, but I'm glad I made it long enough to make that choice now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm incredibly sorry you feel that way, and AI certainly dont blame you for removing yourself form the community.

The thing is, we get a lot people that come here who dont relqly know what it is they're getting into. A lot of inexperienced or uninformed people come through here thinking service dogs are a miracle cure and are easy to train and maintain.

Its important for anyone seeking a service dog  to fully understand all the harder parts that come with it as well. That it's hard work, that it probably wknt work out, that theres a lot of stigma that comes with it.

I've unfortunately seen a lot of dogs that either had to be washed out when their handlers.werent prepared for it leaving both of them stuck, or that should have washed a long time ago but qre still being worked under unethical conditions because their handler doesnt know better. It's hard to see and something I'd like to avoid whenever possible.

I can understand why you feel the community is hostile, but most of us do genuinely have the best intentions at heart. I never ever mean to be discouraging in my comments, but I know they can come off that way because of the ammount ki negativity in them. But that's just the way things are as a handler. There are so many cons and so many things you can never truly prepare for. Its hard, and it's hard work, but it's easier when you know what all the negatives are going into it.

I hope you the best </TEXT>

I live in a small town so I often have to go out of town to pick up or do things I don't have access to. So for me it's like, wallet, phone, ID, cash? All check. Easy. Simple.

But then! I also have to check for my SD. Vest, shoes, socks,  poop bags, water bottle, bowl, mat, training treats, extra food, just in case chews. Whoops did I check the weather? Might need an extra water bottle, gotta make sure I'm not spending too much time outside in the summer. Gotta make sure there are places I can stop by to let him potty while we're there too.

And that's just for day trips. Staying anywhere overnight gives me an entire other "just in case" bag to worry about too.

<TEXT> It sounds like you may be dissociating. While it is often a symptom of mental health problems, it can happen to anyone for a variety of reasons. You may have depression, anxiety, PTSD, or you may simply be stressed in those moments. If it is concerning to you, or if it is disrupting your life/causing undue stress, please speak to a professional about it as they will be able to help you more than the internet can.

As for dealing with it, learn some grounding techniques. There are many of them and you may need to try a few before you find something that works for you. A grounding technique is something that can reconnect you to the present world around you. It can be as simple as having a familiar object to fiddle with or wrapping yourself in a blanket. The most common is to engage all your senses. Find 5 things you can see 4 you can touch 3 you can hear 2 you can smell and 1 you can taste. And breathing exercises like inhale for 5 seconds, hold for 7 exhale for 8.

Theres plenty more if you look them up online. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most shepherds arent recommended for psychiatric work due to their tendency to pick up on their handler's emotions which could lead to anxiety or over protectiveness.

That said though, if you find the right dog they seem like a good fit for your lifestyle. If you're looking for an intelligent high energy dog there are Belgian mals. Usually I wouldn't reccomend them to anyone, but considering you live an active lifestyle and plan on doing sports you already have a leg up on most people.

Labrador and golden retrievers are good choices as well. Not only are they the most recommended for service work, but they tend to fit into just about any lifestyle.

Rough/smooth collies are often recommended for service work as well, but I dont have much experience with them so I dont really know what to say. Though I imagine that as herding breeds they would do well living an active lifestyle </TEXT>

Plus many people dont listen to small dogs. They hear the barks and the growls and see the teeth but dont think anything of it or worse, encourage it because its "cute." So they often end up anxious messes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, anti depressants are especially tricky. Not only do different kinds work differently, but PTSD and depression affect people in all kinds of ways too. So you end up with the task of find the right kind that counteracts the specific way your brain seems to be misfiring in a way your body is capable of processing.

Funny thing is when my psychiatrist prescribed my meds it wasn't based off of how well they work, but rather what the side effects were. The one I was on caused drowsiness and increased appetite. In the end I was still depressed, but at least I was getting back up to a healthy weight and sleeping regularly again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Getting help for mental health is kind of weird like that. You can be getting better, but not notice. You could be getting better in some ways, but worse in others. You could be doing everything right, but the therapy method or medication your on just doesnt work for you even though it works for others.

If you feel like whatever you're doing right now isnt helping, talk to your therapist/psychiatrist about it. Theyll be able to help you find something else that may work better for you. </TEXT>

Heavier mobility tasks are under a lot of scrutiny by the community now since dogs arent really build to carry weight that way. I would especially warn against trainings mixed breed  mobility tasks like that since its unpredictable how it may affect their joints.

Unlike dogs from breeders you can't tell from their genetics how well their structure is for providing such support, and you cant use their predecessors to help predict how age will affect them in terms of stability and bone/joint health.

Not to say it can't or shouldn't be done, but definitely work closely with your vet on this to prevent any injuries in the future. </TEXT>

2nd most common is snapping the neck, but if done incorrectly could leave the lion in a worse position than he already is plus I doubt he would go without a fight.

<TEXT> Honestly youd be surprised the number of people your age that feel the same way you do. Chances are you've probably just never met them because they're keeping to their own too.

I grew up in a small town, so most groups ran together. Yeah, I had and still have friends that like getting drunk, high, and doing dumb shit. But I also had and still have an equal number of friends who just want to chill and maybe play games sometimes. It's not really 99%. Its mostly just the people you actually see.

If you want to understand then you should probably stop judging and start accepting. Dont judge the people around you for doing dumb shit, even if it is dumb shit, and dont judge yourself for not wanting to join them. Accept that your friends enjoy things you dont, and accept that you dont want to follow the flow.

Accept that you and everyone around you are human. We are not built from sterotypes or made to fit into molds.

And if your anxiety is causing you so much distress that its affecting your life and you're relationship, maybe ask a professional for help understanding yourself and finding the root of the problem.

I hope you the best. </TEXT>

Predators usually give birth prematurely, as opposed to most hooved animals. I imagine this has something to do with how difficult it would be to hunt/find food when they're so heavily pregnant.

As opposed to animals like goats or antelopes who are capable of grazing as they go while pregnant, and whose young need to be able to keep up with the herd to avoid predators as soon as they're born. </TEXT>

Dont be so hard on yourself though. Opening up is hard, it's scary. You never know what will put someone off or push them away until after you've said. You dont know how their perspective of you will change. Its ok to be afraid of that. It's a scary thing to be afraid of.

That said, I'm happier when I open up. The relationships I have with the people I'm honest with are so much better than those I put up a front for. I have less pain to hold on to, less regrets built up inside, less weight on my shoulders.

I will always recommend a good therapist if you can get to one, but in the mean time try to be kinder to yourself. It's hard, and you may not always mean it, but it does help. Even tiny things like avoiding selfdeprecating jokes, or even joking about how great and amazing you are. </TEXT>

It takes a lot of brain power to ignore the kinds of things we expect our dogs to put aside, especially considering a lot of it goes directly against their instincts. Imagine having to put up with people just randomly grabbing you while you're working.

I will admit though, the do not distract patches are just as much for me as they are for him. I dont get much attention public where I am thankfully, but it's still incredibly annoying when I have to stop what I'm doing because someone is yelling at me or my dog trying to demand his attention. I dont want people touching my dog without my permission, and I am tired of getting barked at in public.

During training the distractions were a great opportunity to work on focus and socialization,, and I do still take the time to reinforce that when the opportunity presents itself, but now that hes moved past that part of his training it's honestly just irritating for me when people try to distract him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To qualify for a service dog you must be disabled.(unable to do one or more major life activities) and would benefit from a dog that is trainer to mitigate their symptoms. No one is required to have their SD with them 24/7, there are SDs that only ever work at home, or that only work in public, and there are many times a handler may feel it's best to not have their SD with them.

"Need before breed." The breed if service dog doesnt particularly matter as long as they have the right temperment and are capable of performing the tasks needed. That said, you are more likely to find the right dog if you look for a labrador, golden retriever, poodle, or rough/smooth collie. Given that you and your child already have experience with a lab, I think starting there would be best.

Before going forward though, speak with your child and their healthcare provider, therapist and/or psychiatrist to determine if this is a good plan or if other treatment should be tried first. Service dogs are a huge commitment and may be liable to make mental health issues worse rather than better especially for a younger person.

Somethings to talk about with them include, what tasks may benefit your child, how current treatment is going, what other treatments should be considered first or can be continued in tandem with the SD, in the ~2 years it takes to get a fully trained SD will your child's mental health change?

Lastly, with a dog already in the home they may undermine your SDs training. If you go forward with with getting an SD take advantage of the wait time to make sure your current dog as good manners (no jumping on people, no eating off the floor, no counter surfacing, no barking or at least stopping on command, etc)

<TEXT> Not exactly. Most animals still require some form of heat in order to carry out regular functions such as digesting. If cold blooded animals are kept in a too cold environment they risk the same health problems as we would (hypothermia, infections, frostbite).

Their metabolism just slows down in the cold so as long as they aren't using up too much energy moving around then they can go longer without food as opposed to us warmblooded mammals that would still need to continue eating and burning the same amount of energy to survive winter.

Its not so much that they're still able to operate regardless of environment as it is that the environment dictates how well they can operate. If the reptile species had evolved to colder climates then they'll brumate. While brumating they become sluggish, only ever moving to drink or occasionally bask if there's warmth nearby, but if they don't have a safe place to brumate in they still risk death. Alligators, specifically, make mud burrows which are able to insulate a bit against the cold to help keep them safe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many cold blooded animals brumate through the winter months, kinda like hibernation. Except theyll still wake up to drink and bask sometimes.

My favorite season is the very beginning of spring when garter snakes come out of brumation because they tend to den together. Then you see entire swarms of snakes coming out of the ground and everyone not prepared for it starts screaming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you working with a trainer? If not, speak with one. Training a service dog is work, and you can easily end up having to wash for small mistakes. Its rarely, if ever, recommended to train on your own, even if you are a professional trainer. Doing it with no experience is going to be an uphill battle every step of the way and having a service dog trainer on your side is an immeasurable help.

For now, work on basic obedience and the CGC it's a good start. The most important things for your dog to learn are a "look at me" or "focus" and a "leave it"
You'll be using both if those often. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While you are correct that a service dog can come from any breed, there are reasons the community prefers to vouch primarily for the fab 4, especially if its someone first SD.

Unusual dog breeds are more likely to encounter access issues. Especially for someone who hasn't had to deal with such things before it can be difficult to handle and make going out harder instead of easier.

The fab 4 are the fab 4 because of their success rate. You are much more likely to find a suitable prospect in one of these breeds as opposed to others for a few reasons, but namely due to availability, and a precedent of being specifically bred for service dog work. It's much easier to find a breeder who's line produces successful service dogs in these breeds and that in turn reduces the risk of washing, and with some thing as important as a service dog it's a good idea to reduce that risk as much as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Theapists are human. Is their job to help you, with no judgement? Yes. But they are still humans, with their own feelings, their own boundaries and their being. Even if you didn't actively mean your actions to be aggressive I am not surprised she was offended and felt attacked by what you did.

Yes. Your sessions are about you, but in this case it was important for her to voice her concerns. Of she is uncomfortable continuing to be your therapist then you should know about it. If that discomfort could be worked through then you should work through. That means taking the time during your session to talk about it. It was to help you too.

You need to understand how your actions affect others. Being responsible for that comes with having mental illnesses. Being stressed out may be the reason for hurtful actions, but it does not justify or excuse them.

Take the time to ask yourself how you would feel if someone wrote "fuck you" to tou over and over again regardless of their reason. What if that person was someone you were trying to help? Wouldn't that hurt? Wouldnt you want to say something?

Finally, if it was so stressful for you, why didn't you put it down? Why didn't you stop and step away? Why didn't you say something about it to your therapist? I am not blaming you, this is not an attack, but the most important part of therapy is communication. I understand it was an assignment but if you are ever under so much distress you should say something. If a practice is making things worse your therapist should know about it so they can try a different approach. There is nothing wrong in needing to stop. And your therapist should understand that. </TEXT>

However, albino animals are still capable of expressing other pigments such as those responsible for blue, yellow, orange, red, or green colors (the majority of which are not found in mammals).

<TEXT> Unfortunately this isnt really something randoms internet denizens cant answer, especially considering you haven't spoken to anyone else about it yet., But here are somethings to take into consideration.

1) you *must* be disabled to qualify for a service dog. That isn't limited to physical disabilities, but it is still a huge qualifier. Are you still capable of doing all major life activities on your own? How much does this hinder your ability to function?

2) is there anything else you can do to mitigate your symptoms? Honestly anything else. A service dog is a lot of money and a huge commitment. The process is long and stressful and will likely be at least a years wait no matter how you go about it. If there is any other way to help I suggest you at least consider those options first. Things like therapy, prescription medications, support systems and grounding techniques are incredibly useful with or without a service dog.

3) can you recover from this? Sometimes mental health issues and traumas can last a life time. Sometimes they're recoverable. Again, a service dog is a huge commitment and the process of getting/training one can take years. If you think you maybe be able to recover then it is usually best to put your time and effort into that instead of into getting a tool you may not need after all.

4) will a dog make things worse? It sounds like you may have symptoms of social anxiety. Having a service dog is liable to make that worse. Of you're worried about people staring and looking stupid, imagine how uncomfortable it would be to have people staring, approaching or harrasisng you because of your dog. Would you be ok being singled out as having a disability everywhere you go? Would you be able to stand up for your public access rights when someone wrongfully denies you entry? Are you ok with random people walking up and trying to touch you or your dog and then yelling at you when you say no?

5) keep in mind that an SD is not a cure. Their job is only to mitigate symptoms. They cannot fix you. They will not solve the root of your problems. Any form of SD works best alongside other treatment. That includes therapy and/or medications. (While I'm here, in terms of medications there may be some that are take as needed, but more importantly. If you find medications that work for you, they can keep your symptoms at bay the same way you seem expect a service dog to.)

6) what do you expect your service dog to do?Service dogs are specifically trained to task reliably. What tasks do you need? If they're just there to provide comfort then that is not a service dog.

I dont mean to be discouraging or harsh in anyway if it sounds that way. Again, I cannot tell you whether or not youd be able to benefit from an SD. But the reality of it is, Service dogs are hard. They can help, they can be life changing, they can make things so much better, but they are hard and it's easy to go wrong. And then can just as easily make things worse. You need to be aware of the bad side of being a handler before you make your decision. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a tricky question for me to answer, because I want to say yes, but for different reasons. I dont think they should be bred for aesthetic reasons or as pets, but I do think there could be something to gain from scientific research of the spider gene and its connection to the head wobble.

Similar genetic neurological disorders can be found in other animals as well, and I think knowing where it comes from and why and how it all works could be highly beneficial for scientific and medical communities.

Of course ideally in this testing these animals would be provided the best standard of life we could give them, and testers would follow animal ethics and welfare laws, but unfortunately I'm afraid that may be too much to ask.

As much faith as I have in animal scientists I dont have much faith in humans as a whole for this research to be done safely and humanely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a service dog. Hes trained to help me during night terrors due to his ability to pick up easily on my anxiety even when I'm sleeping. It was a happy accident that hes able to tell night terrors from normal sleep, and though hes trained now, we didn't know  when we first got him.

His response to night terrors originally was **not** to wake me up and provide comfort like he does now. No, he used to climb onto the bed, stand over you, and stare inches from your face until you woke up. Not to mention, he is a large black dog, with an unconventional body type that naturally holds his head and tail low when hes standing, and that due to my mental health at the time I had a hard time remembering I even owned a dog.

So when you wake up in a state of terror only to be immediately met by two glowing orbs and a row of teeth inches from your face and a vaguely canine shaped shadow standing over you well...

Anyway, I screamed. My partner woke up, they screamed. My dog just stood there staring until we both stopped screaming then hopped off the bed and went back to sleep. Hes a good boy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depending on the injury there are different kinds of pain. There sharp pain (stepping wrong or twisting) that feels like you've been stabbed it usually comes on suddenly, can be immobilizing, but fades relatively quickly, then there's throbbing pain (usually an old or chronic injury) or comes in waves, stays longer, and while it can be ignored it almost always comes back, and burning pain (usually muscle strain) when muscles are working hard or have been over worked, it feels like the limbs are on fire or filled with acid, usually accompanied with soreness.

Old injuries tend to flair up on occasion even when you're not doing anything. Usually when theres atmospheric pressure change, think old people with arthritis cryptically saying "theres a storm coming, I can feel it in my bones." That's actually pretty accurate. Holding a joint in a weird position can also make it lock up and cause pain when you start moving again.

Pain is not consistent. Some days are better than others. Sometimes you can walk fine without aid, sometimes you cant stand up at all. Sometimes the pain is a dull throbbing, sometimes it feels like your leg is filled with flash shards. Sometime it makes your muscles stiff and heavy, sometimes it makes them weak and shakey. Sometimes the pain is there, but your so used to it that it hardly feels painful at all, but you know you cant push yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is no longer accurate information. With the rise of animal welfare awareness many AZA accredited zoos have moved away from keeping wild caught animals. While yes, many of their animals come from breeding programs, those programs have a very important cause, animal conservation. And many animals born from those breeding programs are reintroduced back into their wild habitats. Zoo breeding programs have saved many animals from extinction in the wild such as the black footed ferret.

Not to mention, no AZA accredited zoo keeps their animals in small cages. It is simply not allowed. To gain accreditation their enclosures must be large enough to accommodate all their animals in a reasonable space (as in not cramped), and often times the space visible to the public is only a fraction of the total space available to their animals. Acredation also includes being able to take care of the animals medical, and mental needs as well including regular veterinary check ups and providing plenty of enrichment.

Thankfully, with more public education about animal welfare and animal rights roadside zoos (the kind that often dont care for their animals and shove them into cages for their entire lives) are falling to the wayside and losing funding and shutting down.

Not all zoos are bad and the AZA is making a difference. I've seen it myself. When I was younger the San Antonio zoo was only a quarter of the size it is now. I distinctly remember their 5 giraffes being kept in a literal concrete pit. Now the giraffe enclosure is massive, and built into a cliffside where they can hide away from the sun and visitors if they so choose. If you go visit them today you can still see the vestiges of the old zoo no longer in use because they took the time to educate themselves and improve. </TEXT>

Talk to you GP anout changing prescriptions instead of increasing your dosage. There are tons of medications out there and none of them work the same way. Most of them dont work for most people. Maybe considering taking a gene test to figure what kind of med works best for you.

Like someone else mentioned, therapy doesnt work if your dont know what your doing.  Think about what you want to fix and more importantly *how*. Therapists are only guides. They can only point you in the right direction and provide support when you need it, but they can't do anything if you dont know what you want out of it.

Before you can start getting real help, something that isnt just pills for the symptoms, before you can start actually working towards getting better you need to take a long hard look at yourself. Figure out what you want (and dont say "nothing" or "death" theres one thing else too) and then you can really take that first step. </TEXT>

Sucks that my brother took the time to talk with me and set up a plan for two months to prepare myself for being on my own and father comes in to tell me that if I leave I'll never be allowed back in the house again and I'll never be trusted as a member of the family.

I left less than an hour later, never had the chmace to explain things to my brother and no one believes me about my father.

What's funny is he also said that all my friends who helped me move out were just going to use me and abandon me. It's been 5 years, we dont live together anymore but they still help if I call them. And my parents have been begging me to return home since I left. Thought I wasn't allowed back? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in Southwest Texas. We used to get them every year, it was my favorite part of summer.

Then they just kinda disappeared? I don't know what happened. They just stopped showing up one year and I haven't seen them again until recently after I moved across town a couple years ago. Its still not as many as it used to be, but every now and then in June I can spot a couple flying around the yard.

We're building a pond now and I have this weird hope that the water will bring them back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any form of training tool can be dangerous if not used correctly, from prong collars to flat collars. The important thing is knowing how to use them responsibly.

I trust the handlers here to know how to use their training tools. Most of us work with or are professional trainers. And most (if not all) of us have a close relationship with our dogs and know how to communicate with them and read their body language. I trust the handlers here to know their limits or to ask for a second opinion if they're not sure.

That is, unfortunately, not a trust I extend to most dog owners. I'm not saying anyone is stupid or incompetent. It's just that if people don't understand things like why physical exercise is important for their dogs, or how to tell when their dog is uncomfortable, I don't expect them to understand that e-collars and prong collars are a ***communication*** device more than a punishment device.

On top of that, in such a large community, misinformation spreads much more easily than it does here. Its easier here to correct someone when they say to yank forcefully on a prong collar to control their dog. </TEXT>

When I first started studying animal sciences a lot of people still believed that enrichment was wasted on reptiles and that large enclosures were *bad* and should actively be avoided.

You shouldn't shut down information from others simply because you believe you know more than them, or even if you do know more than them. Even professional agricultural veterinarians learn things from the "uneducated" farmers they work with.

<TEXT> Except it wasn't a single incident. That was just the one that got the lawsuit. And what would save more money then buying 1 set of plants and then saving the seeds every year so that you *dont* have to go back and buy seeds again for the next harvest.

Perennial food plants that aren't trees. Well to start the one in the post. But theres also lavender, rosemary, ginger, onion, sweet potatoes, grapes, black berries (if you dont consider bushes a tree) rhubarb, and variations of asparagus, broccoli and artichoke. That's not all of them, but perennials make for great food crops.

Edit: I apologize for taking a while to reply. I'm helping set up a luncheon for work. Being on reddit it highly irresponsible of me, but I thought this crop idea was incredibly interesting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get where you're coming from, but a lot of the big agricultural companies are pretty well known for screwing over their farmers by forcing them to replant to guarantee yearly sales. The most notable of these is [Monsanto](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowman_v._Monsanto_Co.) I've even heard of farmers getting in trouble for seeds that fell and grew on accident.

They may still sell the crop, but likely not to any large or industrial farms. Perennials don't often make for return customers since they don't need to be replanted. If they do put it on the market to larger farms it probably wont be at a very accessible price which would discourage most farmers from purchasing.

It may sound a but conspiratorial, but its unfortunately just good business practice. I grew up and still live in a rural area and quite a few of my neighbors and teachers were upset about how they're treated by the seed companies. </TEXT>

Canines can also use direct tracing. Most notably wolves when traveling through snow as direct tracing is great for preserving energy when walking on loose surfaces such as snow and sand.

<TEXT> It's kinda disheartening reading so many replies from people that had to struggle alone. I got lucky, I know I did, but its still catches me by surprise that not many people have friends like mine.

The thing is, there are people out there who are willing to help you. They may be few and far between, but they're out there.

What sucks about hotline is they're usually volunteers. They're just people. Normal people who aren't trained to handle these situations outside of calling 911 if it escalates. I've gotten good people from hotlines, people that actually took the time to listen and talk me down and make sure I had a plan for staying safe after I hung up, and I've gotten people who just said "oof" until I stopped talking. It's a gamble.

The mental health system in most places suck. Full stop. Most of them are given scripts to read off of instead of real training. A lot of them are still running off of old research that does more harm than good or even worse, still believe that most mental illnesses and disorders dont exist. There are good ones, but damn do you have to search for them.

But when you find someone you can talk to, it does help. Even if its just screaming into the void of the internet at no one in particular.

If you want an internet stranger who's willing to listen, you're free to DM me. I dont talk much, but I'll hear whatever it is you have to say. </TEXT>

<TEXT> u/CautiousVoid has some good advice, but to expand on what they're saying about stressful body language, there's a lot of ways dogs could express stress which can change depending on the individual so while reading this list take into account how your dog acts normally.

Ears being held back, tail being tucked between the legs, having wide eyes, yawning, panting, drooling, whining, growling, mouth shut with tight lips, moving stiffly, being reluctant to take treats or taking treats more aggressively, ignoring or responding slowly to cues, moving slowly, stopping entirely, holding their head low, raised hackles, refusing eye contact, offering the wrong tasks or being frustrated when cued, and likely some others I may have missed.

Again, its important to take into consideration how your dog acts normally. For example my SD often holds his head and tail low unless something has his interest or if he feels threatened, and hes a fluffy black dog in a warm environment so he pants often so I'm usually more concerned when his mouth is shut and rely on his ears to tell me how he's feeling. They're incredibly mobile and I can actually use them to pinpoint locate critters he's found in our house when they're our of my sight line.

You'll learn your dog's body language the more time you spend together, but take some time to watch them every now and again. Understanding what he uses to communicate with you will really help your relationship and you can be more confident in knowing if your training too much or not enough, and help you respond to and handle more difficult situations while you're doing PA training. </TEXT>

Most pet dogs (less lately thankfully) dont get the ammount of mental and physical excersize they need to thrive. Many of them spend hours at home without much to do while their people are at work or school.

Service dogs especially love their jobs. They wouldnt work if they didn't. Not only would it be unethical, but it would also be dangerous for the public, the dog, and yourself. A stressed dog cannot do their job reliably, and working an unhappy dog would only lead to more problems. And a part of making sure your dog enjoys their job is giving them breaks every so often. After all, they're dogs first.

You're not the only person ever allowed to pet your dog either. You're in charge. You're the handler. You get to choose what does and doesn't fly. If you want to be the only person allowed you interact with your dog, that's perfectly fine. If you want your friends and family to be able to play with them when they're off duty, that's perfectly fine too. They just cant pet them *while they're working* because that's an interference with their job and puts you at risk.

Over dependance is a real problem with SDs. Its something this sub warns against often. But it's not too big of a concern as long as you keep working with the treatment you're on right now. Keep working with your therapist, keep building coping skills, and keep working on yourself. As long as you're capable of at least functioning without a service dog you should be ok. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way it was explained to me when I was prescribed my meds was that they medication itself cant fix your thoughts. If you've already had suicidal thoughts it will not stop them from happening, but a part of what the meds do is increase energy and motivation which, if the root of you mental health issues are not being addressed some other way such as therapy, could lead you to being more able to act on that suicidal ideation.

If you ever experience any negative side effects from any medications, talk to your health care provider. That goes for any drug, not just mental health prescriptions. If the meds start making you feel suicidal tell the person who prescribed them to you as soon as you can so they can address and change your treatment as necessary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds a lot like me.

Unfortunately when it comes to helping someone with mental health problems, there isnt much you can do if they aren't willing to ask for help. Sometimes the most you can do is just be there, just exist and wait, and have open arms when we're willing to come to you. And a lot of times, that's enough.

Have you talked to her about it? Have you asked what she needs from you when she has panick attacks? Have you asked her if she actually wants to be comforted?

I know I don't. When I'm stressed and on the verge if a panick attack the last thing I want is someone hugging me and telling me that it's ok. Most times I just want to be allowed to have my break down and move on. Of course that's just me. Everyone is different.

My advice would be to have an honest, open talk about it. Promise not to judge or get upset, and listen  to whatever it is she has to say, regardless of if you agree or not. And let her know that you are there, you are with her, no matter what and that if ever needs anything, help, comfort, someone to talk she can go to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah! There's a lot of jargon around it! But essentially leucism is incomplete albinism.

For more fun facts piebaldism is a form of leucism. It's an incomplete albinism that leaves patches of full pigment as seen in dalmatians and on some snakes and cows.

And pointed or siamese cats have a form of albinism affected by temperature! Essentially warmth denatures the pigment in their fur only allowing color to grow on the colder parts of their body. Sometimes you can see their coat change with the seasons and if you shave a pointed cat their fur will grow in colored first then turn back to normal. This is also why pointed cats pretty much always have blue eyes </TEXT>

<TEXT> How did you double check? I've worked with an albino cat and know someone who owns an albino cat, both had visually blue appearing irises, though their pupils still clearly had no pigment and often looked red. Also, even just a cursory google check shows animals with visually blue irises, though again their pupils still lack pigment and may appear red. But of course this still varies between individuals within each species depending on their specific genetic and they are still capable of having visually white, pink, red, or tawny colored eyes depending

I also work with snakes and I understand that the leucistic genes for them appear as a white animal with blue eyes, however again, it does depend on the individual species. Snakes have more complex pigments available than we do, and so their Gene's inherently work a bit differently. For example, albino snakes while yes have red eyes, still carry yellow or sometimes even orange markings whereas in most mammals albinism resulted in pure white

As another example leucistic rats can have pink, or ruby red colored eyes, but will never present as blue eyes because rats entirely lack the gene for blue pigmentation in their eyes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Blue are are not necessarily indicative of leucism, it depends highly on the species of animal. In some animals the complete lack of melanin caused by albinism with still result in blue eyes. Prime examples of this include dogs, cats, and humans.

The true difference between albinism and leucism is that albinism is the complete lack of pigment whereas in leucism there is often some faded, or patches of pigment left behind. For example if you were to look at leucistic lions, they have blue eyes yes, but also the skin around there lips retain a natural black pigment as opposed to an albino where the lip would be left entirely pink. </TEXT>

What proper dog training and discipline is doing more like teaching your dog manners, self control and understanding human rules while also establishing trust and self confidence.

With smaller dogs like you said, they're often mishandled and not well trained, but on top of that they are usually insecure due their discomfort being ignored by people because "omg how cute" which is what leads to their aggression. They learn to immediately escalate to growling and biting because that's the only time they're heard </TEXT>

<TEXT> When it comes to tasks it helps to speak to your doctors about them. They know your condition more than we would and they know your treatment plan. They would understand most what may or may not help you.

It may also help to consider what you're currently doing to mitigate your symptoms. What are your coping mechanism? Do you ground yourself? What do the people around you do to help? Does it help more to receive comfort to stay away from people? If the former, DPT works well, if the latter consider a task to guide you out of crowds.

What do you mean by "tactile stimulation?" It *might be a cue if trained, but I'm a bit iffy on it. If tactile stimulation is simply allowing to pet them for grounding, I'm not sure it's a task as that's something pretty much any dog could do and requires little if any training. However, if the cue is for the dog to nudge or paw at you to remind you to pet them for grounding then that certainly does count as a task. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depression doesnt mean you can't be happy sometimes. Even if it's just a passing moment or for some days. At the worst of my depression I wasn't able to feel anything positive at all. For so long I just wanted to be "ok" but even that seemed impossible.

Now I can genuinely smile most days, I can laugh, I can enjoy my old hobbies and new ones. But I'm still suffering. I still have barely enough energy to take care of myself. I still hate myself just as often as I smile.

Depression doesn't simply fade away because you're capable of being happy. Depression is a mental illness *because* it lingers even when you're happy.

 But those fleeting moments of happiness do still mean something. Even if they don't last. Even if they're few and far between. Holding on to them was on of my first steps towards getting better. They went from fleeting moments, to good days, to now weeks I can smile and laugh genuinely. Even though I'm still struggling and I relapse frequently, it's finally starting to feel like this is a battle that can be won. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, I can't answer all of your questions, but I'll give you what I can.

1) when it comes to alerts service dogs can pick up on subtle changes to your person. In the case of anxiety there can be tiks that a person has before an attack. For me its rubbing my wrist and holding my hands near my chest. That's the signal my SD uses to "alert" to tell my I need to sit and breath. They can also act as a reminder for their handler to take their medications.

2) Are they moving to a rented space or do they own the new home? If they're moving to a rented space that falls under the FHA they need to have a doctor's note stating their need for a service dog and they need to make a request to their landlord for accommodation. Occasionally landlords may request additional information for file keeping or insurance purposes such as vaccination records, or a general physical description of the dog, but that is it. If they are flying there they also need to contact their airline about accommodation and necessary forms.

5) the dog doesnt technically need to wear anything. However ear muffs are strongly recommended for prevent hearing damage. Other optional wearable equipment included boots and maybe safety lights/reflective strips if theyre going to be in a dark area. That said, I and some other handlers wouldnt take our dogs to most concerts. They can get loud and rowdy and it could put my dogs health and/or safety at risk. Out door concerts or calm concerts such as for an orchestra I'm fine with. But for crowded rowdier concerts I prefer bringing someone else to stand in for my SD instead. If they're going to be performing I'd recommend keeping their dog off stage either in a kennel or in someone else's care.

6) service dogs are dogs. Anything a dog would so a service dog will do. Some dogs bark, nudge, paw or sit down and stare at you when they need to go out. Some dogs are trained to ring a bell. For the longest time my dog would bring me random objects from around the house. Shoe meant "let's go outside" oven mit meant "I'm out of water" the face of his long since destroyed favorite toy "let's play". Since then its evolved with his training. Staring, pawing, and nudging are all things taught him for his work, but he discovered those cues are easier for me to understand so his communication with me evolved to doing those things instead. Its the handlers choice how they want to communicate with their dog be it trained signals ot natural quirks.

7) anxiety is a had disability to have a dog for. It can lead to over reliance if the handler is not careful or does not have structured coping mechanisms in place in case their service dog ever can't work. In reality this can be harmful, leaving the handler basically helpless if their dog is ever out of commission and it is important to continue treatment through a psychiatrist and/or therapist so that they are at least capable of functioning without their Service dog. I wasn't even able to consider a service dog until I had my anxiety and depression under more control. I had to start on medications until I could function enough to start building coping skills so I could function as a person first. For your story I think you should take that into consideration. What is your characters relationship to their mental health? Are they capable of functioning without their service dog? How long would they be able to go before breaking down? Do they have other coping skills or care takers?

Also, access issues are a very real thing, but they do not happen every single time we go out. For me specifically it only happens on the occasion, though for others it may be more often as it varies by location and can depend on how the team presents itself. For me most of the hubbub about my dog is initiated by children, they are incapable of containing their excitement/confusion/fear and will often yell to their parents about it who usually quiets them down and either explain things or simply quietly move on though one or two have asked if their kid could pet him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You seem awful bitter. I'm sorry if this comes off as condescending as I dont mean to. But if you want to spread information and educate people it may work better if you're a bit less hostile about it.

I find people are more willing to hear what you have to say if you have an open and honest conversation about it with them. Not many people like feeling like they're being attacked or put down, and not many people like listening to an abrasive asshole.

I actually think this topic is quite important especially considering the state of America right now. And the more people that understand how deep these problems go the better.

Anyway, I hope you have a nice day and thank you for bringing this information to people's attention. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand that fully, and I didn't mean to imply that psychiatrists were void of responsibility. I apologize sincerely if it came off that way or if it seemed like I was blaming patients for their experiences.

I've been through the system as well, I know full well how terrible it can be, please do not claim that I haven't faced my fair share of bad "proffessionals." I've been misdiagnosed, mistreated and had personal information handed freely to my abusers and had my safety put at risk due past therapists.

However, having bad experiences personally does not mean that those experiences are universal. Having one, or many, bad therapists or psychiatrists does not mean that everyone should halt seeking treatment entirely or that all mental health professionals cannot be trusted.

If a treatment is not working or is making matters worse, talk to your mental health team. If they cannot or are unwilling to change your treatment plan, seek a new health team. The unfortunate thing about treating psychiatric issues is that a lot of it is trial and error. Everyone is different and treatment for one will not work for or may even harm others and practicing therapists and psychiatrists all have different approaches themselves. Not to mention many people still run off of outdated information. I am not denying that. Bad psychiatrists and therapists exist and there are more of them than there should be, that us absolutely true.

But that is no reason to turn away from them entirely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well psychiatrists still act as therapists of course. Their job is always to help treat the root of psychological issues, but if you didn't want medication you didn't need really need to go to a psychiatrist. Going to a therapist likely would have been a better fit for you as they provide the same resources but are not capable of prescribing meds, and likely would have saved you some money as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The unfortunate part about treating mental illnesses is that a lot of it is trial and error. Some meds work for some people but not others. Some people can't get better without pills but sometimes pills make things worse. For some people therapy is a godsend, but for others it's a nightmare, and even then there are quite a few forms of therapy to take into consideration.

But I do have a question for you. Psychiatrists deal in the medical part of psychology. A lot of their job involves medicine and so their initial thought is usually to turn to prescription medications. If you didn't want to take pills, why did you seek a psychiatrist instead of a therapist? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heavy mobility tasks are a bit controversial so I wont get into them, but barking to alert other of a fall, or pressing a special button to call emergency services is definitely a task a SD could do.

If your worried about her being able to handle the training, which is perfectly valid, try looking into SD programs if there are any in your area (not familiar with Germany sorry) or hiring a trainer that could help with it even take over the harder parts of training.

It's definitely something you'd need to speak to both her and a medical provider about as they would understand the benefits and set backs much better than we would, but it's certainly something that could be taken into consideration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It helps me a lot to download a copy of the reference and draw the basic shapes or skeleton over them. If you're looking at fabric draw lines to help you follow the curves of its surface. If you're looking at a tree draw circles around its branches to help you figure out how the leaves are grouped together. Look at your arm and draw guidelines on it, it's very much just a fancy cylinder.

 When coloring or shading I also like to draw arrows on my reference to help keep track of the light source that way it's easier to figure what its hitting and where shadows are coming from. </TEXT>

I know there are bad handlers out there. Heck, the only K9 handler in my local PD nearly choked my service dog. But most handlers care a lot about their animals.

And if it helps, with drone technologies advancing like they are more and more K9 units are being taken if the front lines and moved to safer jobs like tracking and scent detection instead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most working animals are rarely (if ever) stressed out. You can't work a stressed animals. Not only is it unethical and illegal in many countries, but a stressed animal will not work. If an animals does not like their job they will not do it, and if you then force them to do it anyway they will not do it reliably which could be dangerous for everyone involved.

While I'm here though, it may ease your mind to know that with the advent of drone technology more and more K9s are being taken off the front lines and moved instead to safer jobs such as tracking and scent detection. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like to practice new shading techniques on spheres first. They're a very simple shape that allow you to test new styles or materials before adding the to a more complex drawing.

The first step is always to choose a light source. I would recommend starting with a slightly forward light source hitting your subject from the side as its usually the easiest to visualize. If it helps you can draw an arrow to remind you where it is and what its hitting.

After that its really just following the shape of your subject. Highlights go on the side the light source is coming from and shadows on the opposite end. Follow the curves of your line work. Its pretty easy to figure out once you get going. </TEXT>

I didn't have the strength or self security to get me through the hard times I knew would happen. If they ever had to go no contact or if anything else happened. I was not strong enough to deal with that.

<TEXT> I felt this. I think a lot of people do. When I was starting college my brother told me this:

>Remember, no body knows shit. Not you. Not the upperclassmen. Not graduates. Not your professor. No one. Nobody knows what the hell they're doing. We're al just doing our best.

I dont know if that helps you, but it helped me out a lot. There isnt really any preparing for the real world, it happens, and sometimes all you can do is your best. And sometimes your best isnt enough but that's ok. A lot of my anxiety was fear that I would never get my shit together that everyone else had themselves all figured out and I'd be left behind. Turns out no one has their shit together and idk. I feel better knowing I'm not the only struggling. Is that mean?

Anyway. Try not to think too much of it as "growing up." Honestly it more like you're just learning more stuff. Taxes, bills, rent, work. It's all just learning and it doesnt happen quickly either. You'll get there, sometimes you may not even feel like a proper adult, but you will be. As long as you're putting one foot in front of the other then you're as prepared as you can get for the "real world" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try not to worry yourself with the fear of going "crazy." Mental illnesses suck, I'm not going to deny that, but if you get the help you need they dont have to mean your life is over or that you'll never be who you want to be.

I'm not going to diagnose you, that's something only a professional can do, but it does sound like you are experiencing some form of derealization which can be a symptom of mental illness, but not neccesarily indicative of one. You're capable of realizing this line of thought isnt necessarily true, logical, or normal which is usually a good thing, but it's still worth talking to a therapist about. When these episodes happen is there a trigger? Are you stressed out?

Consider picking up some grounding tools as well. Focus on the physical things around you rather than your own thoughts. Take deep breaths, count them. Choose a color, count the objects around you that are that color. Find something heavy or soft, pick it up, feel it, feel the weight, the texture. Find 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste. Drink a glass of water, make sure you finish it.

Grounding techniques can help with dissociation if that's what you are experiencing, but they're also just great to know in general. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It can come with increased stress, and I dont blame you being stressed with things as they are right now. You're dealing with more than usual and the brain doesnt always know how to handle that especially if you've dealt with mental health issues in the pasy. It doesnt help that strong emotions slip easier into other strong emotions. So those moments when you're incredibly happy can crash into being incredibly angry or incredibly sad very easily making mood swings seem more extreme.

Get help from a professional if you can. In the mean time reach out for support. Talk to your partner and family about some of your insecurities. If you feel like you're being too much ask them. Ask for verbal validation if you need it. </TEXT>

Change your style too if you're up for it. New clothes, new hair style, different make up. Its q good confidence booster and some time people wont recognize you which helped me a lot when I needed to pick up food.

Talk to who you can. Family, immediate or extended, support groups online, a therapist if it's possible. There a lot of people out there willing to support you if you're willing to reach out, myself included. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The documentation is the same as an ESA in the US you just need a letter from whoever is treating your disability stating that they are trained to help mitigate your disability. But that more is only really necessary for housing accommodation and for airlines.

A service is just a dog that is trained to *reliably* preform a task that mitigates a disability. However, if you are going to be working him in public further training is recommended. There is no required test, but you could look the ADI public access test if you would like a good baseline to follow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> u/mooingturtle is right. With correct form you dont have to worry about the string hitting you. I'm only an amateur archer, but the first thing I was taught was proper form to prevent injury. The only time I got slapped was the only time I had my elbow turned in. I was still recommended to use an arm guard anyway just in case.

But when you're shooting at an Olympic level anything and everything can affect your shot and you need to be as accurate as possible so they use arm guards, and chest guards to keep any loose clothing out of the way. Not to mention they're usually shooting at a poundage far higher than OPs longbow. The amount of damage they could recieve from slipping up is significantly higher so proper protection is more important. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If it helps, AZA accredited zoos are required to do everything they can to ensure the animals they keep are getting the best possible care, from space and health requirements to health checks and enrichment.

Many zoos have done a lot to improve the lives of their animals. Take the San Antonio zoo in Texas for example. I went once for a school.field trip when I was 6 I thing and I remember the giraffes having little more than a concrete cube to walk about it.  But I went back last year and now they have a huge enclosure built into a natural cliff wall as well as an entire indoor section they can retreat to at night, in if weather, or when they get tired if the crowd.

Also, many zoos have done a lot to save animals from the brink of extinction and even managed to reintroduce their populations to their native habitat such as the California condor, Arabian oryx and black footed ferrets.

Yeah, there a plenty of zoos and "pet owners" who dont give their animals the ammount kf care they deserve, but the AZA gives me hope, and with more and more people like you roadside zoos are startung to fall out of fashion leaving more animals in the care of zoos and sanctuaries who genuinely care about them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some planes dont have enough room for a large dog to fit at their handlers feet in which case it is usually recommended for them to reserve another seat for their dog. Whether or not the dog is allowed on the seat is up to the handler and the airline. Sometimes being on the floor crammed underneath a seat can impede a dogs ability to do a task and therefore it is better to simply allow them on the seat instead to allow them to do their job in the most efficient way possible, so long as the airline allows it.

Honestly though, it really isnt anyones business but the handlers to decide if a service dog is misbehaving or not unless its causing a disturbance. But even then a dog barking and jumping could be doing their job. There's enough issues with gatekeeping within the service dog community as it is it doesnt help to judging a handler based off of one photo. </TEXT>

Standary they require a doctors note stating that their presence us necessary to mitigate a disability, but some airlines have started restricting the species of ESA they allow, adding size restrictions or adding training requirements.

I'm a bit conflicted on the issue myself. I understand the importance of ESAs and how much they can help someone struggling, but when theres hardly any regulations for them it has a huge impact on the service dog community. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It can take dogs a while to adjust to a new environment with new rules. My dog made himself at home pretty much immediately. He was relaxed and comfortable with everyone in the household after two days and found his favorite sleeping spots within the week. However, it took him the better part of 6 months to figure out how to tell us he needs to go out to pee and he only started vocalizing purposefully to us within the past few months. I've had him for 3 years now.

He was already himself when we took him home, but I assume his previous owner didn't let him bark often and hes just now figured out that those rules don't apply in his new home. If your dog's behaviors were limited in the same way, hes got a lot of rules he lived for years that he hasn't figured out he doesnt have to follow anymore yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Might I recommend some snakes? They're pretty low maintenance as long as you keep their husbandry in check. Corn snakes, milk snakes, hognoses and rosy boas are all good choices provided they fit in the enclosure you're getting.

They're quiet (if you dont give them anything they can knock over) only eat (and poop) once a week to once a month depending, and though they can be a but hyper at times are very handelable.

Some people might recommend ball pythons as well (I own them) but honestly they can be a bit high maintenance since they are notoriously picky. They'll go off feed for anything from not having enough hides to l their food being the wrong color. They're not particularly expensive to care for, they can just be frustrating at times. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It also always good to take a day off if you need it. Or a few days even. Sometimes you just need to take a moment to step out and away physically to let he struggling leave your mind for a moment.

 but it does sounds like you may also be struggling with some executive dysfunction. Like theres a disconnect between your brain wanting to do something and then actually doing it making everything so impossibly hard to do. It can be difficult to deal with, but there are a few ways that can help over ride it sometimes.

For me it helps when someone else dictates to me what I should be doing and in what order. For others it helps to break down activities into smaller and smaller steps until they're bite sized pieces you can do like *step 1. Stand. Step 2 go to fridge. Step 3 grab food.* Sometimes it helps to skip some steps altogether. Like instead of making a bowl of cereal just grab the box and milk jug and eat dry cereal and drink milk. Another thing I do when I'm struggling is I try to accomplish 1 very small task that I know I can do very easily. Like making a paper hat or or drawing a flower. It doesnt always jump start productivity, but it at least it makes me feel better.

I'm not sure if any of this will help you, but if you need anyone I'm here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nah, I like talking about stuff like this.

Anyway, different morphs (unique colors and patterns that people breed for or mix together) come from mutations in genetics such as albinism. They can have effects of different extremities that make them vary from the normal wild type pattern, but they are still built from the same base. For example the albino gene gets rid of all the black pigment making snakes look yellow and white with red eyes, but they maintain the same pattern.

You can end up with retics that look kinda like berms or vice versa, but there are still those base differences between them that make them easy to tell apart when you know what you're looking for.

I hope this is a more satisfactory answer </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're close! It's a reticulated python. They're really close to berms in terms of body type and size. Burmese pythons usually have a more splotchy pattern with brown colors kinda like a giraffe while retics have a diamond like pattern down their backs with grays and spots of white or yellow.

Berms are also generally known as the more docile of the two. Most pics or vids you see of a giant snake attacking something are going to be a retic and most pics or vids you see of a giant snake just hanging out are going to be a berm.

I'm also not an expert I just really like snakes.

Edit to add more snake facts because snakes are good. While the reticulated python has the title of the longest snake in the world reaching adult lengths of about 30ft, the green anaconda is known as as largest due to its width to length ratio weighing in at an average of 550lbs and a body diameter of 12 inches. Also, while most snakes will curl into an "S" as a tell tale sign they're about to strike, anacondas are notorious of their interesting habit of kinda just biting which why inexperienced snake keepers are discouraged from getting them. In the exotic pet community burmese pythons are known as gentle giants and "puppy dog" snakes due to their generally calm demeanor especially when compared to other giants.

<TEXT> They're very specific circumstances, that are very important and happen more often than you might think.

I took a gamble getting my SD from the shelter. I'll never know what his genetics are, meaning I dont know how his joints are graded, if hes prone to GI issues, arthritis, cataracts or any of the many condition that may lead to his early retirement. O also took a gamble on his temperment and upraising. Trauma from his past may make him reactive to a trigger I haven't discovered yet. Not knowing how he was as a puppy meant I couldn't be entirely sure what kind of dog had I gotten myself into. I didn't know how well socialized he was, what kind of exposure he had. I was incredibly lucky his previous owners didn't abuse him and took the time to teach him basic obedience. And even more lucky he happened to have the right temperment for the job.

Dont get me wrong. I love my SD. Hes saved my life in more ways than I can count and hes a member of my family but if I could do it again, I'd go with a breeder. Someone who can guarantee he wont have avoidable health problems, and spends their baby days making sure they're well socialized, trained, taught manners and are given the chance to gain self confidence. And who are willing to work with me through out training so that if they wash theres a back up plan. So that I know for a fact that I have laid down the foundation I need for a proper service dog instead of gambling on a rescue and risking having to send him right back to the shelter because they washed.

I support shelters. I used to work for a rescue. But there are times when going to a good breeder is necessary. Just because it's a specific situation doesnt mean it's something that should be disregarded. Too often I've seen new handlers adopt a dog as their prospect only to have them wash and rehomed to start again, or worse working them despite it being unethical to do so just because they already put so much time, money and effort into their training. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There isnt really a ceritification process in the states. As long as your dog is trained to reliably preform a task that mitigates your disability it's a Service Dog. How you get there doesnt particularly matter on the legal end of things.

That said I'd recommend starting by getting a health evaluation from your vet to make sure there isnt any risk of health complications depending on the tasks you need and a behaviorist just to double check your dog has the right temperment for service work.

If your dog will be in public access with you then you'll want some public access training. The CGC is a good start but you'll want professional trainer aid beyond that since this will be your first service dog. You may want to expand your search for a trainer a but further. The trainer that helped me was located in a city 2 hours away from me. Some trainers or orgs are willing to work with you over Skype as needed and have in person sessions when possible.

As far as ESA documentation goes, you'll want a letter from the doctor treating you for your disability, but that will only allow you dog into some non pet friendly housing and on some public transportation.

Lastly, and very importantly, a warning you'll hear lot is how a service dog may make your social anxiety worse. Before continuing please take a moment to consider how well you're able to handle conflict, unwanted staring, unwanted photos, and random human interaction with strangers such as invasive questions, petting your dog without permission the the occasional child screaming/crying. Will you be ok standing up for yourself if someone wrongfully denies you access?

I'm sorry, this is long, but i hope it helps and I wish you the best! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Journaling helps along with therapy, especially if you've never gone before. It can be hard to talk about everything the first time if you've gotten used to covering it up. My therapist gave me a journal to write in between sessions that way I could keep track of everything I need to talk about and he could reas it if I wasn't ready to talk yet.

If you dont jive with your therapist dont worr too much about it. Try it out a few weeks and if it isnt working out let them know. If they can't or aren't willing to adjust their ways to something that suits you better find a new therapist. Not all therapy is the same and different therapists work better for different people. Find someone that works well with you.

It might also help if you see a psychiatrist, either along side or instead of a therapist. They're authorized to prescribe anti depressants which can help make things easier to start.

If you're really struggling you may want to consider going to an inpatient program. They tend to have mixed results depending on how the program is run. Sometimes they're really great sometimes they're really bad, but it's something that could be worth looking into.

Also, dont feel too bad about school right now. Yeah, bad grades suck, but there are ways to fix your GPA and theres no rush. The important part is that you get where you're going, not how long it takes. If you need a break to get yourself together before trying again, please do so. </TEXT>

Most if not all of the base snake morphs available as pets came first from specimen captured in the wild and later further refined by breeders into either cleaner base morphs of mixed together into designer morphs.

<TEXT> The community here can be harsh, i can see that, but its rarely with the intention of gatekeeping. The fact of it is Service Dogs are messy business. There is a lot of bad that comes with the good. A lot of mwdia talks about how great they how, how life saving and useful and all the wonderful changes that come with them, but they dont often cover the struggle it takes to get there.

Getting a service dog is a heavy decision to make and weighing the cons is such an important of that process. You can't gloss over it. All the horrible deterring things people say here need to be taken into consideration. Ultimately it is your choice, we cannot decide for you if you can handle all the of the problems that come with the process, but we can make sure that you know about and have the chance to think about it before committing to something that honestly could just end up making things worse. Being realistic about the high possibility of failure is just as important as being supportive. </TEXT>

It doesn't seem to me that Maple was trying to tell you what you can or cannot do however their tone may have come across, of course you're right that the only people who can dictate that is you and your health team and as members of the service dog community we should know that more than most.

However, they do bring up incredibly valid points that I do hope you take more time to consider even if they may not apply to you. The truth of it is, you never know how a SD will affect you until you get one and that no matter how much you prep and research and train you will NEVER be prepared for everything.

I, and hopefully most of the rest of the community, only want the best for you. If anyone says anything rude or harsh its usually because they're worried and want to give you the best chances of success possible. Many of us learned the hard way and if we could save you that suffering then we will try.

I hope you the best and that you find something that works for you </TEXT>

<TEXT> Theres a difference between support animals and service animals, at least in the US, the wording of laws is different in other countries. The main difference being that Service dogs are specifically task trained to mitigate a handlers disability and are the only ones allowed to be with their handler in non pet friendly spaces.

That said however, that does not make support animals any less important for the people that have them. People that have support animals often experience a greater quality of living and a better capability of functioning on their own. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If handlers and trainers do their job then service dogs actually love their jobs. Dogs like learning, they love being evolved with their people and they like helping. It's important to keep their minds engaged in activity as well as their bodies, and not doing so can lead to stress due to bordem often causing behavioral problems.

My service dog wags his tail the hardest when j grab his vest. He gets restless and frustrated when he doesn't get to work for extended periods of time. He loves engaging his mind, and he treats his job like a game, not to mention he gets to go on adventures, see new people, new places, and spend more time with his family than most pet dogs.  Of course If his job ever became a chore to him, if he ever wasn't enjoying himself, I would absolutely retire him to being our family pet instead. Its unethical to work an animal that doesnt want to work and most handlers would agree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone has their own perceptions. They have their own moral code, their own lines of what should or should not be crossed, their own opinions on the world around them.

You cannot expect everyone to see you the same way. Not only because they are all different as individuals, but also because if someone is not close to you, it's impossible to know every part of you. Most people only see pieces and draw their own conclusions based on that and their own views of the world.

I'm considered a sweet person to my friends for the same reason other people hate me. I'm "weird and immature" for the same things that make me "brave and down to earth." One friend appreciates me for my honesty while their partner loathes me for it.

Everyone is telling the truth. It's just their own version of it. The only way to get to your version of the truth is to either ignore all of them, or to consider how their own biases affect the way they view you. The people who think I'm naive are used to being lied to, betrayed and taken advantage of, but the people who say I'm wise value open communication and honesty in their relationships. But just because they're polar opposites doesnt mean they're mutually exclusive. It's entirely possible to be both, and I am. I'm naive for expecting everyone to be ok with complete honest and thinking that will solve every relationship problem, but I am wise for understanding that good communication is an important foundation for building relationships.

I am everything others see me as good and bad, but they can only really see pieces of that either because that is what I have shown them or because those traits are what they have chosen to define me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For some dogs it is associated with their gear. It's pretty easy to make the connection that vest=work. For others they have an on/off cue to tell them when work starts and when it ends. It's important For them to have a work mode in public because theres a huge amount of distractions out there and if they aren't completely focused they can't task reliably. Theres so much going on, and a lot of it requires them to ignore their instincts which requires a pot of brain power.

At home it's a bit different. It's a familiar environment with only so much going on. There are few distractions and therefore they can have more freedom while still being able to task. So even though they're playing and relaxing they can still keep an eye out just in case.

My dog is rarely "on duty" at home. He gets the same freedoms as any other dog. But if I ask him to work he will. If I need a task he knows. On top of that I dont need him to task much at home. I'm in a less risky position, and if my partner is home they can do it instead.

It's likely different for other handlers, but this is my experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try bringing it up with your therapist and support team and family. We can't exactly tell you what will or wont help you, we dont know you or the situation as well as they would.

That said, I usually advocate against getting service dogs to aid in social anxiety especially in sever cases. A service dog is liable to make things worse if you already can't handle social settings. People will be staring at and confronting you regularly. If you already can't talk to people will you be able to handle strangers telling you you can't bring your Service dog into a store? Or claiming that your faking? Or random kids running up to pet your dog out of nowhere? On top of that, the process of obtaining a service dog in the first place can be incredibly stressful. Whether you go through a program or owner train many handlers go through a phase of doubt and fear. Feeling like they're faking, they're not training hard enough, it's taking too long, they're failing. Would you be able to handle those negative emotions onto of what you're already feeling?

Not to say getting a psychoatric service dog isnt an option, they can help under the right circumstances but if you dont have good coping skills now, a service dog isnt a replacement for them.

I used to have sever social anxiety to the point I was developing agoraphobia. I couldn't even go out to the car alone. I had been researching service dogs too at the time, but if I had gotten one then it only would have worsened my mental health. I never would have left the house with people confronting me like that which in turn would have made me even more depressed because I'd have a service dog I couldn't take on walks or care for properly. It took some work with my therapist and psychiatrist, but I did eventually reach a point where I was capable of handling conflict and a service dog became more viable.

Again, this is definitely something to bring up to your health team. They would know the most about whether it's something you could handle, and if not they could help you reach a point where it can be a more viable option. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Weight loss is usually called a journey for a reason. 1 kilo in a month is actually huge if all you're doing is controlling your portion sizes. But you need to be careful though, dieting is great but like anything else needs to be dome in moderation. Cutting back too much too quickly can lead to severe health issues. Eating only 900 cal a day is especially dangerous. You really shouldn't be dropping lower than about 1,200 depending on your life style.

Results dont come quickly for anything. In the scheme of things a month is hardly anytime at all. And it's especially hard to see progress when you first start.

If you'd like to see progress more quickly and safely maybe consider talking to a professional nutritionist. They'll be able to point you towards better diets for your lifestyle and help you get on a regular work out routine to lose weight faster and tone up your body. And remember, you rarely see progress until you've made it far enough to see where you've started.

Edit: grammar </TEXT>

<TEXT> In addition to what lady leaf said, some dogs get their tails docked or their ears cropped to keep them safe on the job. Namely police and military k9s, it's usually considered better to have them docked/cropped at a young age by a properly trained vet than to risk injuries on the job from people pulling or cutting their ears and tails to get away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dissociation. Its when your mind disconnects from the present, your body and/or the world around you. On my experience it happens when I experience more than I can handle. In your case perhaps the argument with your father led to your brain disconnecting in order to cope.

Its often a symptom of mental illness, but not indicative of it. If you dont experience it often you're likely ok, but do talk to a therapist or other professional about it if you feel that's necessary. You should also look into some grounding techniques in case you ever experience it again, they can help.yoj come out of the state faster. Breathing excersizes, engaging your senses, or anything else that can help you refocus and reconnect to the present. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends on the service dog and the job. Some SDs can be afforded treats and breaks while working since not all jobs/tasks require all eyes on their handler 24/7. My SD can afford more liberties on the job than a medical alert dog since his tasks rely on my cues instead of alerting to changes I can't pick up myself, as long as his attention is primarily on me or returns to me after a distraction it's fine. If I feed my own SD treats or pet him while hes working it's ok since his focus is on me anyway. The problem with distraction comes when it's someone else doing it.

Not that I'm condoning what this lady did. Absolutely not, but just not because the ice cream could be a distraction. I would never feed my SD random icecream especially if I dont know what's in it. I dont care how well I understand my dog's stomach feeding him random people food is trouble and I would never risk the possibility of him getting sick even if it's just a minor stomach bug from something he ate. And especially not while hes out on the job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have an Australian shepherd mix, no telling what he's mixed with, but whatever his genes he ended up with really small ears. People often think they're cropped and mistake him for a rottweiler, which works out for me since he wears simple black gear most people assume hes some kind of police dog and no one questions him.

However, this has led to a couple kids screaming or crying when we catch them off guard coming out of an aisle and some teenagers fleeing from us thinking hes K9. I also get an uncomfortable number of people checking his gender because he has "feminine hips?"

So far no one has accused me of faking save some "friends" and I haven't experienced much access issues because of him being an abnormal breed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fear of dogs, especially if it is deeply ingrained is a big reason to wash for public access. If your dog is afraid of other dogs, which they absolutely will encounter in public, then they may not task reliably around them and/or the job may become stressful for them. Even if the aggression is "trained out" if a dog has been that fearful especially for so long they arw still liable to revert at any given time, especially in a stressful situation such as on the job. You need to take in consideration her wants and needs as well as your own. Do you think she would be comfortable working? Even if you get her to stop reacting to her fear do you think that fear will actually go away? How stressful would working be for her? If she enter fight-flight mode when you take her out now, would she be ok constantly going with you to new places surrounded by strange sounds, sights and smells?

However, that is not to say they can not be q service dog. If you live in the US at home service dogs are a things. They're dogs that are task trained, but do not work in public which could be a viable path for you if it fits into your needs.

Also, at 5 years that's already a bit old for q servuce dog. Not to say it can't be done, but you would only have a few years of work before you have to start considering retirement. Most handlers I know start thinking about retirement around 6 years, and start prepping for it at around 8 years with goals to retire at 10 if all goes well. But at that age health complications are more liable to happen and many dogs end up retiring sooner than that. Considering it takes an average of about 2 years to fully train a service dog your dog would already be about 7 by they time they can work in full which already nearing retiring age if they dont experience any other health issues like arthritis, cataracts, hearing loss, or GI issues that commonly occur in older dogs.

Is it possible? With enough hard wirn and patience there's a chance. But is it the best move for you? You're working against a lot here. Age, previous trauma, engrained fears and habits. Dogs have been washed out for less. You'd be sinking a lot of time and resources into something that wouldnt last long even if things worked out. Honestly, I'd say you'd be better off waiting and getting a different dog to be your SD and keeping her as an ESA for now.

I hope I dont come off as harsh saying that. I dont mean to be. I hope you the best whatever you decide to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not sure if I can talk for anyone but myself, but I do agree with the sentiment that the world is never better off without someone.

Everyone has a role to play in the world around them,  the world not be what is if they never existed, and on top of that everyone has someone that care for or relies on them, regardless of how how good or bad they are.

My partner has done some things in their past. There are many people who believe the world would be better off without them, including themselves at some point. But if they had succeed in taking their life I never would have found the support I needed to keep living mine. I never would have found the strength to leave a toxic environment. I never would have found the same satisfaction with life that I have now.

If I had succeeded in taking my own life, my friends never would have grown up the same way. They too would have suffered alone. Even if I am a burden,  or a toxic person, if I died when I wanted to there wihkd have been a gap left in the lives I've touched.

If the random guy I talked to on the internet that knew night had decided to end things after all I probably would have followed. Even this kid, whose I name I never learned, who I didn't speak to for even an hour had such an impact on my life. If I hadn't spoken to them, if they decided to follow through with their plans, things would be different. I wouldn't be here.

Everyone is capable of being better, doing better, and making an impact on the world around them. Large or small, its important. Good or bad it's important. Everyone is inportant. </TEXT>

Now employees often stop me to make sure everything is going ok or in summer to offer my SD a bowl of water because it gets incredibly hot here.

However, my parents have taken to using my SD to manipulate me. I dont have the best relationship with them and my mother especially as taken to "oh but should you excersize your dog" as a go to for trying to get me to spend time with her, but then when I need to bring him to go out shopping or to a movie or anything social suddenly shes full of reasons to leave him behind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I apologize if the community seems hostile. Most of the time it's kinda a "tough love" mindset that often can come off as aggressive.

For tasks, it helps if you take time to make a list about your symptoms. How does you BPD affect you, and what effects does it have that makes it debilitating for you, and then to think of things that help and forming a list of tasks based off that. Like when you have a panic attack do hugs make you feel better, or do you prefer having space? Do you disociate? If you do, how? From there you could decide of DPT works better or body blocking/leading to a safe place or nudging/licking for grounding. Take some time to talk about with your therapist as well since they know more about your coping skills. I could list tasks for you, but it's more important that you find the tasks that work the best for your symptoms and your life style. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What do you mean by "shows characteristics"? Pinstripe is a codominate morph, meaning it will show fully in tandem with other morphs. Its doesnt really appear partially, it's either there or it isn't.

If you mean it shows characteristics as in the pinstripe gene is visually present you may be confused as to how pinstripe affects visual appearance. However if you mean it shows characteristics in terms of incomplete dominance (the heterozygous form of this gene shows incompletely or merged together with other genes) or traits of a het recessive gene (ringers on het pieds) then you may be mistaken on the how the genetics of the pinstripe gene actually work.

<TEXT> Well, you are mostly right. In the US there is no national public access test. It may be required bu some programs or trainers, but not legally.

The legal definition of a service dog is a dog that has been trained to reliably preform a task that mitigates their handler's disabilities. There is no other requirement. However, to have public access Service Dogs should be properly trained to be able to remain focused and under their handler's control when in a public setting. Service dogs that are disruptive, destructive or just generally out of control, may be asked leave establishment despite public access rights which is way many trainers and programs try to follow the public access test provided by the ADI. </TEXT>

Some handlers would say this is a wash, but seeing as their prospect is so young if OP works with a service dog trainer and behaviorist they *might* be able to bounce back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Again, I'm not saying that you are wrong. Ultimately, breed does not matter as much as the individual. A lot has changed over past couple decades. Heck, a lot has changed over the past 5 years. There's been more research, more studies, more statistics gathered.

I am not saying that a good service dog is dependent on breed. I am saying that looking and goldens, labs, poodles, and smooth collies is a good place to \*start.\* They thus far have the highest success rate (though still prone to washing out if you don't get the right individual) and are easily available. There are more people breeding service dog lines for labs than there are for Beaucerons. If you've just started out looking into getting a service dog its a good place to begin without getting bogged down. There's a lot to take into consideration as a first time handler. What traits they should look for. How the public will react. What they can or cannot handle as a handler.

<TEXT> Well yes and no. It's TRUE that breed doesnt really matter when it comes to SDs, it's the individual that matters. But the fab four have the advantage of an established history of producing lines with good SD temperments. And then because of that they are much more available as SD prospects whi ccu makes them much more accessible especially for first time handlers.

Choosing one of the most recommended breeds isnt a hard fast rule, and you can certainly do well with any other dog provided you know what to look for. Heck, my SD is an Australian Shepherd mix, possibly one of the worst choices I could have made considered my psychiatric problems, but it worked out.

The fab four arent the only dogs capable of bund SDs but they're also the most recommended breeds for a reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My partner and I started digging out our future pond this past weekend. Everything's going well, but we reached bedrock about a foot an a half, maybe two feet down. Which is fine, that's about as deep as we were gonna go anyway, but I was wondering if it would be possible to use this bedrock as the bottom of our pond?

Of course the big concern is leaks. We've already found some holes in it and tested them to see if they held water. They don't. Right now we're thinking of sealing the holes to where they dont leak, and using the rock as the floor, but I'm not sure how practical that is.

Would this work? Is there a good way to go about doing so or sealing the natural rock so it won't leak? Are we better off just using a pond liner? I really like the way the natural stone looks and it seems to cover the entire area we're gonna use, but I'm open to other suggestions if it doesnt work. Thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My first therapist focused most on my anxiety as at the time it seemed to have stemmed from PTSD due to an event that led to me being sent to her in the first place. She was a mom so it was easy for me to feel comfortable around her. She helped me understand my feelings regarding the trauma, that it wasn't all just feel, but sorrow and anger as well. She helped me find ways to handle the the problems that arose from my anxiety as well. She was the first person to teach me about grounding. She told me that it's ok if I dont understand how conversations work right now, I could just echo questions back at people until I figured things out again. She also taught me the trick about looking above peoples heads instead of making eye contact so that talking isnt so uncomfortable. She taught me a lot about finding ways to survive while I figured things out, which was important. I wouldnt have made it to my second therapist without those tools.

My second therapist focused mostly on my depression as that was an immediate threat to me. He helped me through the process of healing. He explained to me that I wont feel like I'm getting better. that I'll feel stuck or I'll backslide a lot and that's ok. He helped me find the path to being alright with what I was going through, and to understanding that it doesnt define or take away from who I am. He helped me find people I could rely on and helped me learn to put more trust into those around me instead of bearing the burden alone. He gave me even more coping mechanisms to help me through panic attacks as well and even helped me get my service dog.

I was lucky that I got two very good therapists. For a lot of people it's a lot of trial and error. There different methods for doing everything and itll take a while to find something sticks. None of my sessions were ever "fake it till you make it." They sought out the root of the issues and started at why am I the way I am and what can I do to regain control of that. What are the smallest possible steps I can take each day towards getting better? What makes me feel safe? What makes me feel strong? How can I used those?

Tl;dr: Therapy didn't make me change the way I thought. It helped me accept the way I thought and find a way around it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just a friendly reminder, since people are suggesting training tools. Make sure you know how to use a training tool correctly before implementing them and remember that they are not an end all plan and while they can help it's always best to work on the core issue as well.

How long have you been working on it? And what steps are you taking? Some dog take longer to learn than others. Are you doing your heel training only outside when you go for walks? Start inside first where there's less distractions and work your way up. Training is a process, and often times when you think your dog just isnt getting it it means your moving a bit too fast. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everything you said about owner training is 100% on point. I owned trained my SD as well, with help from someone in a different city. It is absolutely NOT easier or cheaper than getting a program dog.

 Theres a reason I waited 2 years before I even thought about getting a prospect. There is absolutely no way I would have been able to keep up with his needs as well as my own as well as training. I already hated going out in public enough as it was, there was no way I'd be able to drag myself out everyday for PA training, especially not with people staring and kids screaming at me every time I stepped into a store.

Whenever I see someone asking about PSDs I worry a bit, because theres no way to know if they're at a point where an SD would be more harmful than helpful or if they're able to put in the work necessary to handle the responsibilities and adversities that come with getting a SD. I dont want to say no, because it could help, but I dont want to say yes either because they might not be ready.

It's great the there are more people seeing SDs as an option for them, and it's great that they turn to the community for answers, but we are not the people to turn to first. We dont know the situation, we dont have the information necessary to give they answers needed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everyone else is correct, but maybe I can help clarify a little. Cats do not use their tongue to scoop the same way dogs do. Instead they use the papillae on their tongues (those tiny back facing spines that make their tongue rough so that they can groom themselves) to grab the water and as they pull their tongue back surface tension makes the water form a bit of a "column" which the cat then catches in their mouth by chomping on it.

This cat just drinks weird. </TEXT>

<TEXT> On top of reactivity, aggression, anxieties, like everyone else mentioned, dogs can also wash because of health reasons such as hip dysplasia, sever allergies, arthritis, injury and others that could cause pain or difficulty moving.

They can also be too friendly (easily distracted by strangers or eager to meet and follow new people), not great at following or understanding commands, have too high energy for the job at hand (often times working means sitting still for hours at a time, if a dog is unwilling to settle it could be disruptive and stressful for the dog). Too smart, sometimes dogs will take the tasks they've learned and use them inappropriately such as turning lights on and off when they get bored, opening all the cabinets, retrieving items that don't belong to their owners etc. Alerting at random to recieve treats/praise. Being too Independent, wanting to do things on their own terms instead of their handlers. Unable or unwilling to task reliably. Overly intune and taking on their handlers fears and anxiety as their own. Having a high prey drive causing them to be distracted or a danger to small animals. They may just not like their job.

Service dogs especially if they're in public, need a certain personality type. Enjoying work, confident, focused, and calm and should remain indifferent to strangers and new places while working. Not many dogs fit into that mold, and then down the line health issues or trauma could result in a dog that did have the right traits being unable to work due to physical or psychological issues that arose from the event. The reason washing out is such a big problem is that it's always on the table. At anytime our dogs can  get hurt or develope anxieties and other behavioral or health problems that make it unsafe or unethical for them to continue working. </TEXT>

Watching them attempt to move around was clearly painful and many times the herd would leave them behind because they would rather just lay alone in the barn.

Idk what famers you've been talking to, but plenty of them do care for their stock just as much as they would any family pet. Even ones raised for meat. They're still a part of the family and they still deserve the best care possible whether they're going to slaughter or not. If you'd like to see more that kind of farm life look at some homesteads, there some homestead forums online and they're usually happy to answer any of your questions about it as long as you ask politely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! My condition is similar to anemia, I'm not sure if I can help, but I can try. Most alerts aren't exactly trainable, a lot of times it's a dogs natural ability to sense when something is off, however you could still try scent training to see if that might help. Take samples when you have different levels of iron and see if your dog can tell the difference between them if there is any, you might be able to get help from a trainer to shape that into a proper alert.

Is your dog already trained in medical response? It can be just as useful as a medical alert if they're incapable of learning to alert, or if your condition is something that can't really be alerted too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> >Can you imagine non-dog people thinking lean athletic dogs are too thin

There's already so many people who see healthy sight hounds and think they're emaciated. I'd really hate to see that misinformation spreading in the SD community.

You're right. The problem with this isnt that it's a bad idea of course you shouldn't work unhealthy dogs but if we start calling everyone we see out about that it invites even more misinformed gate keeping than there already is. So many people already say that if it's not a lab/golden/poodle it can't be a service dog, I absolutely do not trust the general public to be able to keep track of individual dog breed body scores.

I've already had friend tell me my dog was overweight in winter because his fur grows out and makes him look rounder. His diet and exercise didn't change, and he weighed the exact same as before. But of course they couldn't know that. How could they? And how could we know that a person isn't following their vets recommendations by just looking at them?

We absolutely should not be working unhealthy dogs, I agree. But we should also trust our fellow handlers to follow that guideline as well. Dont put someone on blast about it, just ask them and have a conversation if you're concerned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Running away because I got pregnant and then getting into drugs. Or running away because I was on drugs and getting pregnant. Or some combination of those 3 things, I never actually heard the accusations.

The only thing I did was run away. I was in a horrible situation where I was failing school because I was playing a suicide game every night. I hated myself so much, and existing was so exhausting for me that the only thing I cared about was seeing how close I could get to dying.

I was trapped. My parents refused to let me move out or to even take a gap year to get my shit together. My brother sat me down and made a plan for the future which was great until my father said that if I left the house I could never be trusted again and no one would ever love me.

So I called all of my friends and I left.

It wasn't until recently that my mother had called all her relatives saying that I was pregnant, or on drugs. Or both? She was anxiety ridden because I refused to talk to her for about a year. Possibly two. So I can't really blame her for freaking out. But also, have some Goddamn faith in your children! You fuckin raised me you should know I'm not an idiot!

All that happened when I left was I got a job, lived on a sofa for a few months and then moved into an apartment with my friends. I've been pretty much on my own for 5 years now and they still think I can't take care of myself and I'm still bitter about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know a lot of what we say here may come off as a bit harsh or discouraging, but I promise you we have the best intentions. Everyone here cares and mo body wants to see you ending up in a worse position for trying to help yourself.

I'm going to give the same advice I usually give regardless of your age. You need to talk to someone if you aren't already. Anxiety is horrible, I know, and it's hard, but it isnt something you can rely on an outside source to take care of for you. You need to be able to help yourself as well. It isnt fair to you or anyone else to rely on them 24/7.

Talk to your parents, or your school councilor or any other trusted resource you can find so you can start taking the first steps towards the help you need. Service dogs are not a cure. If you don't have the support system and coping mechanisms in place then getting a SD wont help much and may actually make things worse for you. If you can get into therapy or talk to a psychiatrist please do. They'll be able to help you get to the root of your mental health issues and help guide you through the process of getting a service dog if you decide you will still benefit from one.

I can not Express to you how vital it is to have a support system when dealing with sever anxiety. It helps so much even if it's just talking to someone. Without my support system and my medical team I never would have reached a point where I was able to get my own service dog safely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, I'm fairly certain is wasn't a startle response. He showed absolutely no signs of fear or submission and acted very much the same way he would have playing with his sister or with other dogs.

He was a year old before they were separated, and does have very good bite inhibition, but I am more frail than most so I can't play as rough as hes used to.

I imagine that since dogs yelp to communicate pain, and they will often yelp when play gets too rough that it would translate well to a dog that's been well socialized. But of course, I could be wrong.

Thank you again for your time. </TEXT>

Your BP might enjoy an enclosure with a larger horizontal foot. While they do climbed they are still mostly terrestrial and having floor space is important for them. The general rule of thumb is that your snake should be able to stretch out fully along at least one side.

<TEXT> I had this happen too. But Remember that the people who work at these hotlines are still human, and more often than not they're volunteers. They have off days too and they're often not well equipped to handle the job. Most people who work for hotlines only have a short training period and occasionally a seminar on how to handle a crisis, usually though its little more than "say these lines." They don't know how much they affect us, or what exactly we need from them because that varies so wildly from one situation to the next, and it's not something they're prepared for.

I've had bad experiences where they misread or disregarded everything I said and read from a script, but I've also gotten people who genuinely cared and wanted to help that did help me get out of a crisis and set me up with a plan to help myself afterwards.

It really depends and unfortunately tends to come down to luck of the draw. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not going to say that you dont need or deserve a service dog. If you're struggling with one or more major life activities, then you qualify for a service dog, but ultimately you and psychiatrist are the only ones who can decide if you will benefit from one.

But I will say, that you need to consider if you are in the place to have one right now. Whether you're owner training or going through an org Service Dogs are a lot of work. Doubly so if you're already struggling with severe mental health issues and especially if your parents aren't on board. Getting a service dog is a large decision, and it comes with a lot of extra stress. If you're having a hard time as it is, starting the process now may be overwhelming.

 I dont mean to sound discouraging and I apologize if I do, but the reality is, if you're not well equipped for the harder parts of the process then getting a service dog could just as easily make things worse rather than better. I made the choice to wait a few years before getting my SD so that I could establish better coping skills, and had a better handle on my mental health, because I knew that if I got my SD when I wanted to it would only make things worse for both me and the dog and end up a horrible decision all around.

All of that said though, ultimately you know your limits best. If you think you can handle it then please get the help you need, but if you're not sure then keep researching, keep working on yourself, and keep talking to your psychiatrist and your parents about it.

Also, as for having another dog in your household. It's fine, as long as they're not reactive and as long as both dogs have the same rules. Letting one dog have exceptions that the other doesnt will lead to bad habits developing in either if them. If you go forward with getting a SD make sure your current dog will follow the same grounds rules they have. If they dont have those manners already now is a great time to start training them.

But whatever you decide, I wish you the best </TEXT>

<TEXT> Usually its scent. Dogs have crazy sensitive senses and pick up minor changes quite easily. It can be trained to an extent. For example some alerts are based off of hormone changes like migraines. If you take saliva samples before and during the episodes you can teach them to alert to that particular scent.

Not all dogs can do alerts though, especially if they're alerting to something that has no apparent warning signs such as seizures. Those kinds of alerts usually come naturally. </TEXT>

This was immediately after she had gotten a restraining order on him too. It was wild. So anyway. They got back together like a week after that. Its going great /s. Last I heard he still has my old boss on retainer *just in case* </TEXT>

<TEXT> "Suicide is a sin. If you kill yourself you'll burn in hell forever" - my parents trying to fix my suicidal tendencies.

People think that by condemning it they'll stop you. That if they can convince those thoughts are bad, you'll stop having them. A lot of people are afraid of suicide. They dont know how to confront it. So often times they lash out, because that's the best defense they have.

You're absolutely right that it needs to be handled better. The way my parents responded just made me double down. But unfortunately a lot of people aren't willing to look at that part of humanity. No one likes to see suffering, and rather than help they'd rather turn away and convince themselves it isnt there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For now, just talking is a good step. Anyone you can trust, or even just writing in a journal. It's important to acknowledge what you're feeling and to get it out of your system.

Find some good grounding and coping mechanisms to help your anxiety. It won't get rid of it, but it can help give you some control. Some grounding techniques that have helped me include the five senses: find 5 things you can see, 4 you can hear, 3 you can touch, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. Inhale for five seconds, hold for 7 exhale for 6, repeat. Choose a color, count the number of things around you that color. Is there a particular object you like the feel of or fiddling with? Pick it up when you feel yourself start to panick. Find a big blanket, the heavier the better, wrap yourself up in it feel safe and warm like a big hug. Get a glass of cold water, drink, make sure you finish it.

A lot of these may sound silly, but they can help. If these dont work for you there are others you can look up online if you want.

The fact that you are asking for help is already a great start. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is just... incorrect. I feel you may have a misunderstanding of how service dogs work. Several service dogs are trained to protect their handlers from harm during a seizure, either by getting them into a recovery position or, yes, even crawling beneath their heads to prevent meager damage. But they are trained to do so in a way that is safe for them. If there is a risk of the dog being hurt by doing so then trainer will stop training that task and find a safer alternative. mind you everyone experiences their conditions differently. not all seizures are the same.

Sure dogs can't *stop* your from drinking, or self harm, but that's not what the task is. The task is *interuption*. They can paw and nudge at you all they want, but if you choose to ignore them that's on you. they did their job. For self harm interruption the task is often to respond to distress by asking to play or for a walk, *before* and action is taken. If I show signs of agitation my SD will jump on me in an attempt to tell me to sit and calm down. He **will not** attempt to interrupt if I have already grabbed a dangerous object or begun hurt myself in other ways if I've chosen to ignore him. At that point his job is to alert who he can and be there when I recover.

I agree with you that this is likely not a proper service dog, and I believe I know which comment you are talking about, but please do look a but further into things when youre discrediting them. I have relapsed only 2x since ive gotten my sd and been nearly 2 years clean but never once put him in harm's way. Both ttimes i d very consciously locked myself away from him so that he could do his job safely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am quite late, but I hope maybe I'd be able to provide some additional insight. Theres a reason many people in the service dog community, myself included, generally advise against having a service dog for psychological disabilities. Sure it can work out, but in many cases it can end up making things worse just like you described.


I have a service dog who does indeed help with psychological disorders, but it took me a lot of work to get here. I originally needed one to help with a physical health issue, but wasn't unable to move forward with that plan due to my poor mental health. If I had gone ahead before working on my mental state it would have been a miserable situation. I'd end up leaving my house even less than I already did and my service dog wouldnt have had nearly as much provided for them as they should.

Many people make the mistake of thinks PSDs and ESAs are a replacement for treatment, but they're not. They're a supplement to be used alongside ongoing treatment plans. </TEXT>

Maybe this isn't one a proper service dog, but this definitely is a task a service dog could have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Theres lots of reasons people would do this. Some people just like raising animals. Some people like being self sufficient, being able to provide entirely for themselves. I like homesteading because to me it's the most ethical way to source food. I can minimize my impact on the environment and eat without giving financial support to factory farms, large plantations and other operations or companies that don't think twice about what they're destroying when they clear entire swaths of land to grow their crops or raise their livestock.

And homesteads dont even have to be that big. It can just be a vegetable garden. Or a flock of chickens. My father's homestead just has five goats and a few chickens. Some people even have nothing more than three cows.

It is a lot of hard work, but as far as I'm concerned it's well worth it. </TEXT>

You're right that caring for animals isnt cheap, but when you put in the hard work to caring for them properly, both plants and animals, you often end up with excess.

<TEXT> Healing take times, and it isn't exactly linear. You are going to backslide, but that doenst have to mean you aren't getting better. It also happens in tiny steps, you'll often feel like you're getting no where.

My therapist always said "you never really know how face you've come until tho get far enough to see where you started."

For now, try to forgive yourself when you slip up. Try to avoid putting yourself down and recognize when you're being too harsh on yourself. Try to think more about the things you do like about yourself, even if it's just one or two. What I used to do is I took a dry erase marker and on the mirror I wrote down things I was proud of so everytime I looked in the reflection I was reminded of what good I've done.

<TEXT> I've had this discussion several times as well as doing my own research into it. I think I may have watched dominion before, but I'll be sure to follow think you've provided when I get out of work. I like hearing views different from my own and I like understanding where people are coming from. But I have my reason for my beliefs, and you have yours and I doubt either of us are willing to compromise our morals to conform to the other's.

Thank you again for taking the time to talk with me </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually. Not all the programs I mention a restricted to only pets. They also apply to agricultural and working animals. And the last one in particular applies to all animals.

I personally disagree with your solutions. I dont like the idea of eliminating these animals entirely. I believe that as humans it is our job to protect and conserve the world around us. Both the natural world and the parts we created, separately and together. And animals, whether wild or domesticated species have the right to exist alongside us. We are capable of treating animals humanely, and these animals are capable of living a happy and fulfilling life with us.

I do agree with you though that wild animals should be wild, and live a life free of human intervention whenever possible. Unfortunately, it is the nature of our worlds that they are doomed to collide. Humans will continue meddling and animals, surprisingly enough, have a tendency to domesticate themselves on occasion.

I appreciate everything you've had to say today and thank you for having this conversation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When you see stop breeding, do you mean that we should cease their reproduction entirely or that we should specifically stop breeding for human needs?

I understand that dogs still aren't in the best situation right now. However, it is improving. A lot of things are improving. Humans have come along way in terms of animal care, and we are still improving. Is it enough? Not yet, but we're getting there and that is good. There are more no kill shelters, more fosters, more people being more careful about where there per come from, more sanctuaries, more people cracking down on mill breeders and legal affairs, and animal welfare and husbandry professionals pushing for better laws and treatment in more countries of the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This may sound aggressive, I dont mean to come off that way if I do.

What do you suggest we do with them? Unfortunately they aren't native species so they can't be released into the wild unless brought back to their native habitat as releasing non native species rarely goes well. And even then they may have become to domesticated to survive in the wild on their own, or the sudden influx of population wi disrupt the ecosystem leading to more harm than good.

We can't exactly go back in time to undo human misdoings. Itd be great if we could, but that's not really how it works.

Personally, the only suggestion I have is to improve our methods. Find a better way to reign them and make sure their welfare needs are all met or exceeded so that we can ensure we are giving them the best life we possibly can. Humans and animals can live and work together happily, we've proven that well enough with dogs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the reason you're getting downvoted has less to do with the fact that people hate animals and more to do with the fact that you're contribution to this conversation has been little more than providing a link and then quoting said link while provide little to no personal insight to it unless prompted.

Also, your alternative of using all terrain vehicles doesn't work well in this case unfortunately. In the areas where they use water buffalo for their police transport its usually because they're in heavily forested areas of the jungle and/or near a part of the river that's difficult or impossible to cross on a vehicle. Vehicles cannot travel through their easily and criminals could easily escape on foot. Water buffalo dont have that issue. They can fit in areas 4 wheelers can't and they can swim to pursue in rivers.

I agree with you that this is not the best way to control these animals, and that their methods should be updated. If you have any ideas about how to better go about it I'd be happy to hear it.

Edit to add you are also very abrasive when confront which I imagine most people dont appreciate </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was giving my cats kittens a bath once. For most of them she would sit near by and yell at me to stop occassionally pawing at but never exactly tried to stop me.

Except for the fact that through out this entire process she kept trying to drag one particular calico kitten out of the box. When it was said kitten's turn for a wash she kept trying to grab her out of my hands.

Ignored all of her other children. My dog had decided also during this time that this meant she is abandoning all her other children and kept trying to sneak the box from me while I was fighting her about the one kitten so that I wouldnt be able to wash the rest of them. It took me some time after the whole ordeal to convince him that everything was ok and that their mom was still a good mom so that he would stop following her back into the box. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found the people who actually cared in my life.

My parents in particular fought me every step of the way. Some friends dont really like hanging out anymore, especially in public. A lot of people will give every reason under the sun why I should just leave him at home.

Prepare for the extra work too. If you have a hard time taking care of yourself, taking care of the dog will be an additional toll on your energy. Even if you love your dog it can turn into another chore keeping up with exercise, and training, and grooming.

Speaking of, training is hard work. It's frustrating. You're working with a living being that doesnt understand english. They'll get confused. You'll get confused. You can end up back sliding seemingly out of nowhere and if your mental health is already suffering the training process can make things worse. It's important to take things slow, and if its slower than you want it to be then that's fine. You're not falling behind. You're not failing. You need to take the time to make sure you're doing things right no matter how much time it is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In public shows like this they usually agitate the animal before hand to make it more interesting. I've heard stories from bull riders about how they put bands on the bulls balls to make them uncomfortable and irratiable to get them to buck more. I'm not sure how true that is.

But I can see bulls actually enjoying a game like this if they aren't pressured or forced into participating. They like charging at stuff, hitting things, kicking things, bouncing stuff around. People sometimes give bulls big beachballs or exercise balls to chase around the pasture for fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe another user already said something along the same lines, but I disagree with the way they said it said so I would like to try again.

Leucism with black eyes is possible. The definition of leucism is not chained solely to white animals with blue eyes and it does not describe every white animal with blue eyes. Blue eyes albino animals are also possible and what it really comes down to the the genetics and less so outward appearance.

Leucism is a genetic coding for a lack of pigment in general. This can be presented in a number of ways but is yes most often a white animal with blue eyes. However it can also result in light colored animals with small patches if color jn specific areas and animals that are entirely white save for saving their natural eye colo as in the example of a black eyed leucistic ball python as mentioned by someone else.

I believe maybe you should take sometime to read through your own links before using them to respond to others as well as taking the time to consider the content you are responding to, as melanism doesnt generally result in black eyes either.

Edit: here is my own  [fun link](https://imgur.com/t/the_more_you_know/Mtrxb) with more information about albinism vs leucism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! Cats as well and even birds! The difference between albinism and leucisim goes q bit further than eye color. Luecism is more like a general lack of pigmentation whereas albinism is the complete lack of specifically melanin.

 If an animal doesnt carry genes for any other form of eye pigmentation than that lack of melanism usually translates to red or pink eyes. However, in the case of dogs, cats, and other animals they have traits of blues often hidden beneathe the melanin that makes their eyes brown resulting in blue eyes when that melanin is suppressed in albinos.

There are other ways to tell the difference between albinism and leucism by searching for different kinds of pigments or pigmentation in other areas such as the nose, lips, and feet. </TEXT>

Service dogs are often cross trained. My own service dog is primarily for medical response, however his tasks include other things such as acting as a guide dog for me as my vision tends to go before I pass out, I rely on him to lead me out of danger before I hit the pavement. He also acts as a psychiatric service dog for me on top of doing medical response so he was trained in psychiatric aid and grounding tasks, medical response, guiding, and was originally going to be train for light mobility work as well but I found a better way to handle that instead. And I only have 1 debilitating medical condition and some mental health problems. People have certainly been dealt a worse hand than me

Many tasks can be used to aid in several different kinds if disabilities. People with incredibly different disabilities may need the same tasks performed or people with the same disabilities may require wildly different tasks depending on how it affects. Service dog training isnt so cut and dry as only guide dogs do guide work and only mobility dogs do mobility work and so on. </TEXT>

Hes fine getting them trimmed, doesnt mind the clippers and we have just gotten him adjusted to the nail dremel, but there hasn't been much progress. I've been at it trimming his nails at least once a week for a year now, but the thing is he has black nails and I am terrified of cutting his quick. (Its happened twice already. Once either me and once at a groomer). I'm worried I'm not trimming them far back enough or often enough, but how do I know? How can you tell where his quick is and when its retreated enough for another trim? </TEXT>

You are not a bad person for not breaking quarantine and the fact that you refuse to put your safety or the safety of others at risk does not make you a bad boyfriend. If you show up at that retirement home you would be putting yourself, the elderly and your girlfriends job at risk.

Other alternatives you could do to spend quality time together and show your girlfriend that you still ove her is spending more time on phone calls. If yiugavethe ability to video chat, do that. Have a "date night" sit down and eat dinner on a call together. Or watch movie online together. Play games online together if shes up to it. Let her know that you are there for her to talk to if she ever need anything. The care package someone else mentioned is a wonderful idea.

Being physically close to someone isnt the only way to help them. It isnt the only to support or love someone. Love and care can transcend distance, it can just take a bit more work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Headwobble is something snakes can't really control. They'll corkscrew or flip upside down in more extreme cases because they are incapable of holding their head up correctly. Healthy snakes.can still corkscrew if they choose to, which sometimes they do, but the big difference is that they are in control of their movements, its purposeful and if they have well developed muscles they can right themselves quite easily.

Just to double check though, make sure all your husbandry is correct, temperatures especially. Ball pythons in particular are known for being quite picky about their care and will often injure themselves trying to get out if they feel your husbandry isnt up to snuff. If all of your equipment is set up correctly and you're still not sure check in with your vet just in case. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Helping dogs, especially one this scared is a process. It takes humans YEARS to move past trauma, dogs aren't much different. With that in mind two weeks is absolutely nothing comparatively, and you've actually come quite a ways just getting her front to paws in the crate at all in such a short ammount of time.

Keep in mind, shes just met you, this is an entirely different life for her. Two weeks is often the ammount of time for dogs to just get used to living somewhere let alone start training.

I agree with everyone else, but I also wanted to say that any form of dog training is slow. It takes a lot of time even for more confident dogs. Just because you aren't seeing results now doesn't mean it's impossible, it often just means you're moving too fast and/or expecting too much too quickly. </TEXT>

There's plenty of guides to read and videos to watch for teaching good manners, focus, and building a bond with your dog as well as plenty of communities to ask for help when it comes to simple things like counter surfing, leash pulling and socialization/desensitization.

You have time before you start teaching tasks, it doesnt have to happen right now. You can hold off until things with the virus cool down. Attempting to do full service dog training when you are not prepared or do not have the support system and tools necessary to do so can often lead to making things worse.

Focus on what you *can* do for now. Training a service dog is a slow process to begin with, it can wait a bit so long as you keep up with the basic stuff. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This reminds me of when my dog found a stale tortilla left on the counter by my roommate. It was his favorite toy. He carried it around everywhere. One day it broke and he found out it was edible.

It took me three months to get him to stop attempting to eat paper plates he stole from the pantry because he thought they were also stale tortillas. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Snakes generally give plenty of warning before they bite, it's just that people dont really know what those warning signs look like. Snakes may not growl, snarl, or raise their hackles, but they will do other things like hissing, slapping, hooding up, mouth gaping, tail rattling, and even false strikes before biting.

My own snake is quite audible about when she's unhappy, yet she's never tagged anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most snakes will tell you when they're about to strike, whether a feeding strike or defensively. It is usually their last line of defense and they would rather flee or scare off a threat before attacking it.

While letting a child near any animal unsupervised is quite irresponsible, it isnt necessarily a bad thing to let the two interact on their own terms so long as you're keeping an eye on things.

I imagine that even they're not in the picture her parents are nearby in case things get hairy and that they know enough about their snake to be able to intervene when they start giving warning signs. </TEXT>

It started with pure panic, straining to breath, and a weird emptiness. Then there was a burning at the top of my lungs the spread down to my diaphragm then out to my extremities until I couldn't feel my finger and toes. My vision blurred at the edges like a fog that slowly crept in until I could only focus on one thing at a time. Everything was too bright and cold. I was dizzy and weak and couldn't do much more than lay on the floor.

I hope this can help you a little bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This sounds like something you should bring up with your kid and their trainer. There are pros and cons to doing this as you said, but they depend on the individuals and their preferences and the people who would that the best would be the sdit handler and trainer. You can ask us our personal opinions, but ultimately we dont know your situation.

For me personally, on days when I can't be active and excersize my SD my partner takes him out for me. But they are the only person I would trust to do so. They were a part of the training process and they understand how to interact with him appropriately, what behaviors are and are not acceptable, and everything else they need to know about handling him without me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would love to have faith in Black Jaguar White Tiger, they have excellent facilities and I'm sure good intentions, but the way they handle their big cats isn't great.

Allowing direction human interaction, especially in large groups is extremely dangerous for their employees and visitors. A single tiger can destroy your knee just be accidentally bumping it.

Also, while prides are fine for lions, jaguars and leopards are not social cats. Being in large groups can be stressful for them, but BPWT will throw them all into large enclosures together regardless of species.

It's been a while since I last heard from them, and if they've made changes to their policies then that's great and I am glad, but as it is I have a hard time getting behind them. </TEXT>

She still cries a bit when she hears that we're home, but it's not nearly as bad. She's no longer scratching at the doors and windows, and has stopped crying whenever I have to step outside or to a different room. She has gained much more independence in this short period of time and I am incredibly proud of her.

<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is the place to ask, but hopefully I can get some help or at least pointed in the right direction. I have a 5 month old kitten who was separated from her siblings yesterday, but since then it seems like she's developed separation anxiety.

She will scream when I leave the room. She'll settle down eventually if she realizes she's not entirely alone, either with my partner or with our dog. But that's not really a solution as there are times both me and my partner will have to be gone and we can't exactly leave her alone with our dog.

I understand that this may not last very long as she gets used to the fact that they've been separated, and she does have a sibling that can come over for playdates every now and again, but I would like to know what I can do to lessen her distress as much as possible.

I've dealt with separation anxiety in dogs before, but never with cats. I'm not sure where to even start. Any help at all is appreciated. Thank you for taking the time </TEXT>

And sure they're just an hour away, and I know even though we're physically separated and probably won't talk as much I can still rely on them for anything. But it feels so weird to see them go after everything.

It's like they're taking a part of our lives with them, and I know we can never go back to that. No more walking a door down when I'm sad and dont want to think. No more building blanket forts at the foot of their beds when I'm too scared to sleep. No one to turn to when I'm bored out of my mind. I'm alone now. And I genuinely dont know what I'm going to do without them.

So Im at work, trying not to cry. And failing. Because I'm happy and sad and scared all at the same time, and now I dont have anyone to go to about it anymore </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is something I've known I'd need to deal with at some point as photos of me or my SD floating around could put me at risk. I haven't worried to much about it before as it's not much of a problem in my hometown and I rarely travel. But people are as they will and pictures being taken of my SD are inevitable.

I flew out of state recently and quite a few issues arose, the worst being some lady taking photos of my SD and possibly me at the airport. I don't think they posted it anywhere, so it's not much of a concern, but I did realize that this is most definitely not something I am currently prepared to deal with.

I didn't do much of anything when this happened. I had unfortunately made a long series of terrible decisions the night before and moving was a struggle at the time. All I could really do at the time was stay curled up on the floor with my SD  and stare at this lady while she took pictures on her phone hoping she would stop if she saw me. I mean I could have said something, but I didnt know what.

I've said something before about getting a large patch that says "I do not consent to photos" or something along the lines. But is there anything else I could do? What would be the best way to approach that kind of situation?

Tl;dr: Lady at the airport took pics of me/my sd. What can I do next time this happens? Or what can I do to prevent people taking pictures? </TEXT>

But sometimes, when it's the middle of the night and he's having a good rest, he'll combine both steps and just full kicks me into the wall, which... works? I guess? He doesn't hurt me at all, and it has the same affect as DPT so I don't particularly mind, but I am working on it.

Its limp and seemed unresponsive, but its muscles still respond to being touched (pulling away slightly), we did find a heart beat and I'm pretty sure they're still breathing. When I checked their mouth it had thick mucousy saliva.

I called around my town, but we don't have any reptile vets and our game warden isn't capable of treating snakes since most people around here either want them gone or dead. The nearest reptile vet is several hours away.

We put the little guy in a quarantine tub for now. I don't have the highest hopes, but wanted to ask if there was anything else I could do for them in the time being. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm flying out of country later this month with my SD, and iirc United isn't the best about service dogs. Unfortunately I wasn't in charge of the tickets and I don't particularly want to go on this trip anyway, but that's a rant for another day.

I'm trying to call them to inform them about the situation, but in the mean time my mother keeps telling me that they need a doctors note for him to fly with me since that's what they told her last time she though I would be going with them. However, I'm pretty sure she told him he was an ESA or  PSD. Which, he is trained in tasks for my mental disorders, but he is a medical response dog.

Do I still need a doctors note if he is a medical response service dog? I've been trying to contact their customer service, but ridiculously difficult to get someone to talk to me.

Edit: I'm flying to Canada. I forgot that may be relevant information.

Edit 2: Thanks for all of the advice everyone! I really appreciate it </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I would like to preface this by saying that I suffer from mental illnesses which I do have a service dog for and while I do my best to not let them interfere with my life I recognize I still have my limitations. My parents however do not.

My cousin is having a marriage this summer which requires out of country travel. Which wouldnt be too big of an issue except that the last time I had traveled to visit them it had only been for four days and by the end of it I was beginning to have fainting spells because I was too anxious to eat or sleep. It took three days of recovery once I got home before I was able to work again.

I agreed to attend the wedding, it's a big deal for my cousin, but I said I would only be able to go for a week. That's the amount of time I asked off from my job, and that's as far as I trust myself to be able to handle it.

My mother booked the trip because I can't afford tickets but she booked it for two weeks. I do not trust myself to handle two weeks. Especially considering that after only four days I was starting to black out. I told her I agreed to a one week trip and that I do not want to be there the full two weeks. I've reached a point in the conversation where I just want to say either I'm rescheduling my flight or I'm just not going at all.

I'd hate to miss it. I've already missed a lot of big events due to my mental issues and I feel like my family is starting to hate me because of it.

I really dont think I can just suck it up and deal for that long though. Would I be the asshole if I cancel because of this? </TEXT>

I'll have stints where I'll genuinely enjoy it again, but then I go back and read through it and I'll hate it.

Does anyone have advice for getting back into it? I really did enjoy writing and there's so much I'd like to get down on paper. Thank you in advanced

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm sorry, I just really wanted to share since I'm so proud of my SD for doing his first real alert type task.

He's trained to respond to and alert my anxiety and heart rate, but I'm generally good enough at monitoring myself that he's never had to actually alert. I feel the symptoms and automatically sit on the floor so he can task. I've never really been concerned about if he could properly alert or not because of this.

However, yesterday my was taken to practice driving (which is absolutely terrible btw). By the time I got back home my legs were shaking, all I wanted to do was cry, and I was having a hard time functioning properly since my anxiety got so bad. And practically THE MOMENT I stepped out of the car he jumped onto my chest. At first I thought he was just happy to be home, but he kept pawing at me until I sat down and immediately went to DPT.

Honestly, I didn't even know he retained that task since we rarely go over it, and he has NEVER done it unprompted before. There are days when I feel like he isn't a real service dog since he's an owner trained rescue and I have a sporadic training schedule, but he reminded me why I chose him. He's honestly my miracle dig. I don't know where I'd be without him.

Thanks for reading my spial. I really am just so proud and hope everyone can have more moments like that. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My roommate </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-02-04 06:08:03 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First off. Roommate maybe a bit misleading. It's a duplex. Anyway. I hate him. For a number of reasons.

He's passive aggressive as all gets out. Everyone else is great about being straight forward and we tell him constantly that if we do anything that bothers him, to tell us and we'll try to get better about it. He says yeah no prob. Does he? No. Beats around the Bush, complains but says it's fine and then gets mad when nothing gets done about it or it gets put on the back burner. Lately he's been getting even more obscure about things and wont even say if were bothering him, he just gets more irritable until we figure what the issue is.

Speaking of complaints though. He shits on everything. Its like no one is allowed to enjoy themselves around him. Have a hobby enjoy? Its sucks and only losers have hobbies. Like a game?the company is shit and it was a dumb cash grab that no one should play. Watching a movie? That's gay.

He also makes a lot of suicide jokes. Which normally isnt a problem, but I have pretty bad depression and hearing someone joke about suicide constantly when you're actually suicidal is kind of just... like trying the knot on the nose somedays you know?

He is devoid of all consequences. Nothing he does has any impact on anyone else apparently. Smash a bottle of wine in the grocery store? Whoops. Good thing I dont have to pick it up. Gonna be late paying the Bill's? That's fine it's not like I share electricity with anyone else. (Its a converted duplex. The company cant really split the meter at this point.)

He is SLEAZY. He treats waitstaff like trash behind their backs, but it's a pretty lady then he turns in the "charm." He claims to be a feminist but treats women like meat. Is only ever nice if he thinks he can get laid. As a female, I hate watching the way he interacts with other girls especially considering the things he says behind their backs. "She's just being nice for the money" "shes just pretending to have a boyfriend" "she says it the uniform but she just wants attention." No!

Most recently he got a new sound system. It plays just barely loud enough for me to hear from my room and it drives me insane. Sometime I dont know if it's real or if my brain is fucking with me. It keeps me up at night. Last night I only got 3 hours of sleep because of it. I confronted him about it. I even gave him options. Turn the volume up or down it doesnt matter, but where it's set at right now is genuinely making me question my sanity. He said no one else care about the volume and left it at that.

This has been accumulated over the course of maybe a year, and may very will be over exaggerated. But I needed to get it out. Thankfully the place is large enough  and our schedules are lined up such that I rarely have to see him,and after talking to our friends, they understand me sitting out on hanging out with them when he's around. I've been doing my best to just ignore him, and I'm getting some fucking earplugs. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Diy viv advice? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I'm planning on building a viv for my ball python basically from scratch using an old glass shelf/entertainment unit as a base. I kind of know what I want to do with it, but wanted to ask anyone that's built their own tanks before for any advice or tips, particularly on how to set up heating a lights. Should they be mounted inside or outside? What do you do with the wires? What's the best heating unit, tape, rhp, or che?

Also any advice for installing doors. Are sliding or in high doors better? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Advice for running a planar campaign? </TITLE>

<TEXT> I like taking my party into consideration when building campaigns for them and this time they've decided they wanted to include planar travel as a part of the story.

I've done all the research I possibly could and have notebooks upon notebook full of lore at this point to include as we play, but I still wanted to ask for any advice you guys might have on running planar campaigns. Particularly on making each plane feel like their own existence and world and introducing the players to all of this lore and making it all engaging to them.

How would they play out travel between the planes? Should they travers the astral sea or jump through portals between the worlds? Which parts of lore should I prioritize? How should I start my players journey into their first plane?

Any and all advice is appreciated. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Advice for dealing with comedy players? </TITLE>

<TEXT> Overall, I love my party. They're taking their characters to heart (even though most of them are statistical wrecks) and taking the campaign very seriously. They've all been very engaged and doing their best to advance their characters through the story.

Except for one. I've had him as a player before, but I had hoped things would be different since the rest of the party is serious this time. He just can't not turn the campaign into a joke.

Everything he does is for the lols and and his character is a meme. Its beginning to ruin sessions for the rest of the party. I have no idea how to combat this. We've sat down and spoken with him about this before, but I don't believe he will do anything about it until there are in game consequences.

Any advice? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Disclaimer: this is my first post, so apologies.

My partner of 4 years plans on joining the Marine Corps soon, which is great and I'm proud of him. He plans on marrying me before enlisting so that I can live on base and have some basic needs covered, but I have no idea what happens from there.

I know absolutely nothing about the military. I know nothing about how any of this works or what all goes down. Despite how much I try to research I never know enough.

What's worse is I have some health issues and I don't know how that will work out. I have do a service dog to help take care of me, but with so much happening so quickly I'm not sure it will be enough. I dont know if I'll need or even be able to get a job. I dont know where I'll end up. The entire situation is just scary to me.

Nothing is set in stone yet, but I would really appreciate any words of wisdom and advice. What do I have to look forward to? What should I prepare for? What new regulations will I have to keep in mind? What is the community like? How much does life change? </TEXT>
