<TEXT> Jumping on your question, because I had the same idea: I bought a huge container of lanolin for my nipples and the wool soakers and I was wondering if I could just use it pure as a diaper cream, or if I should make sure to have something else at hand in case rashes appear.

A comment I read somewhere mentioned that they found lanolin too hard to spread on a sore baby butt. My baby's butt is still in my tummy, so I'm looking for experienced advice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Welcome to the club! The first few weeks are nerve wrecking. I‘m not a very anxious person normally, but I found myself worrying constantly and mentally preparing myself for the worst, while trying to stay optimistic. That balancing act definitely takes a toll on you mind!

At the time I shared my fears as well and received the feedback from people further into their pregnancies/already parents that this feeling will stay forever, while only the milestones you‘re longing for will change.

It made sense to me to think this is parenthood: perpetually worry about something potentially going wrong.

Personally, I habe found it not to be true though. I‘m 29+9 now and I am way more relaxed and reassured than I was during the first trimester. All the antenatal care I have received, the ultrasounds I‘ve seen and - most importantly - the strong movements I feel and see have helped develop a deep confidence and trust in my son. He got this!

When he was just a little lump of cells I felt like anything could happen. Now he‘s my son, with a strong beating heart, muscles that grow stronger by the day and lungs that are nearly able to function on their own.

To sum up: I do believe worrying is part of parenting, but I also believe that the type and intensity of your anxieties and insecurities will change over time. So hang in there and - as stupid as it sounds - try to positively take in the intensity of the days and weeks to come. 24 hours will never feel this long again! All the best to you. </TEXT>

- Reduktion von Müll bei Gebrauchsgegenständen (z.B. Seifenstück statt Duschgel, Rasierseife statt Rasierschaum)

Inkonsequenzen:

<TEXT> We spend 20% of my take home on rent.  If you include water, electricity, gas and recycling, it‘s 24%. And then we also have my husband’s income, but that‘s become predictable only very recently, as he was a freelancer previously.

It‘s true that 50% is a lot - but you can afford it! I‘m not a fan of one-size-fits-all guidelines for exactly that reason.

The way I see it, you spend 30% on rent and 20% on an awesome lifestyle that suits who and where you are in life right and perfectly meets your needs. All while being debt free, having a healthy emergency fund and being able to continue saving.

In our case, we know we‘d be financially well better off (i.e. able to save way more money, like you said) if we moved to my home country. Where we are offers us a non-quantifiable lifestyle we enjoy though. For us, that‘s mountains, sunshine and cultural components, for you it might be space, privacy and good pandemic-motherhood-balance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bei richtiger Anwendung hat Natürliche Empfängnisverhütung denselben PEARL-index wie die Pille. Die Situationen die du beschreibst machen die Anwendung durchaus komplexer, aber nicht weniger sicher.

Die Sicherheit wird dadurch gegeben, dass mindestens zwei Merkmale beobachtet werden und besondere Vorkommnisse (Alkohol, kurze Nacht, Grippe...) auch beachtet werden. Diese Vorkommnisse führen nicht zu einem höheren Risiko, sondern dazu, dass im schlimmsten Fall von Fruchtbarkeit ausgegangen und dementsprechen zusätzlich verhütet wird.

Having said that... Diese Einschränkungen haben mich bei meinem ersten Versuch mit Mitte zwanzig dazu gebracht nach einem Jahr aufzuhören, weil ich wirklich kaum je einen Zyklus freigeben konnte.

Jetzt bin ich alt und langweilig und werde dem ganzen vielleicht nach meiner Schwangerschaft noch eine Chance geben. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kommt auf die Situation an.

- Im Alltagsgebrauch mag ich meine Stoffmaske (Werbegeschenk eines Kunden meines Mannes - 0€). Die wird hinterm Kopf zusammengebunden und ist deshalb in Situationen praktisch, in denen ich sie oft auf- und abnehmen muss. Bei Nichtgebrauch ist sie die hässlichste Halskette der Welt und ich muss sie nirgends ablegen.

- Bei vielen Terminen (Krankenhaus, Arzt...) muss ich (in Italien) eine chirurgische Einwegmaske tragen. Ich versuche Müll im Alltag zu reduzieren, kann diese Regelung aber sehr gut verstehen, da diese Masken einer eher standardisierbaren Übertragungsschutz (beim Ausatmen) bieten als Stoffmasken, die aus vielen verschiedenen Materialen hergestellt werden. Chirurgische Einwegmasken bekommen wir gratis vom Arbeitgeber meines Mannes (Schule).

- Hochrisikosituationen: In den Öffis und bei größeren/längeren Menschenansammlungen in geschlossenen Räumen trage ich am liebsten eine N95, da sie einen höheren Übertragungsschutz beim Einatmen bietet als die chirurgische. Ich merke schon, dass ich dadurch etwas schwieriger Atme als mit der chirurgischen, aber in gewissen Situationen ist es das mir wert. Die N95 hat mein Bruder gekauft, keine Ahnung was die kosten. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> La mia domanda entra nettamente nelle competenze di questo sub, ma ci provo los stesso. Verificherò sul sito INPS appena posso, ma intanto mi interessano le vostre ipotesi.

Oggi, mi marito ha ricevuto un bonifico dell'INPS di 342,73€ sul suo cc privato e non sappiamo minimamente come mai.

- Ha la partita IVA e durante il lockdown aveva ricevuto I 600€ per chi lavora in proprio.

- Da settembre ha un contratto annuale da docente presso una scuola pubblica.

- Per quanto sappia, la partita IVA è ancora attiva.

Per caso uno di voi ha un'idea cosa potrebbe essere? Ho googleato un po', ma la cifra specifica non si trova da nessuna parte e consultando il calendario INPS settembre/ottobre ho solo trovato prodotti (es. nuovo bonus Renzi NASPI) che lui non ha né richiesto né il diritto. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You need to get over this. The other comments here are mainly focusing on statistics, surveillance and background checks, but I‘d approach it from a different angle.

You will never have full control over what happens to your child, especially while you‘re gone. It‘s a part of parenting that you‘ll inevitably need to get comfortable with.

Your child will need to stay with another person and they will only feel comfortable if they can trust the caretaker. Your baby can‘t establish trust with their caretaker if you can‘t, so you need to figure it out. During the acclimatisation period of early childhood education and care there‘s a process called giving your child „the inner permission“ to be trusting, loving, happy and comfortable in your absence as well.

Many children that struggle during the first period in daycare settings (independently of whether it‘s a nanny or an out of home setting) do so because they sense their parents‘ reluctance to leave their child with the caretaker, which results in mistrusts of the child towards that person.

I hope I‘m not sounding too harsh, I truly wish you and your child all the best and I‘m confident you‘ll figure out an arrangement that works for your family. </TEXT>

Keines meiner Elternteile hat Abitur, aber mein Vater war Unternehmer und meine Mutter ist Krankenschwester (in vielen Ländern ein akademischer Beruf). Meine Großeltern gehören zum Bildungsbürgertum, sämtliche Cousins und Cousinen haben bei meiner Oma Latein-, Französisch- und Mathenachhilfe genommen.

Das ändert aber nichts an der Kernaussage. Was ich interessanter (wenngleich schwerer messbar) finde ist die individuelle Heimlernumgebung. Wäre spannend zu wissen, ob diese einen Einfluss hat der nicht durch Status/Einkommen/Bildungsgrad zu erklären ist. </TEXT>

The Italian one works with low energy bluetooth that continuously exchanges a number with the surrounding (app using) phones. Once someone gets tested positive, their doctor can register the positive test in the users device and all devices that have been in contact (close proximity for extended time) with the positive user within the past 14 days receive a notification and instructions what to do. </TEXT>

The app now suggest I should contact my doctor (who is on maternity leave and her sub isn't picking up the phone - it's the weekend). Until I have further details, I should self-isolate for 14 days (which have already passed, and I've been in contact with tons of people since).

Or local public administration Corona guidelines say that pregnant women who haven't reached 36 weeks of gestation (I'm 26+5) and who are free of symptoms don't need to do anything specific.

So now I'm... confused. Not even worried (if I had it, I had it and it's probably gone - I feel fine), just confused. I also called the local information number, where they just told me to call my doctor. Great.

I did inform the one person I was hanging out closely with that day, but other than that: Should I scare everyone I've been in contact with since, just so they know? There's nothing they can do about it now, I guess. Not sure how long the incubation time is, but if I was infected in September 3rd, is there any worth in "warning" them 16 days later? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congratulations!

That's alright! You can feel conflicted about it in the beginning and still get around and live through the excitement phase. When we started trying, my period was late straight away after the first cyle. All I wanted was to get my period, so that I could drink the fancy ass wine I'd gotten for the weekend. 195 days after my last one, I'm still waiting for that period :) Much like you, I somehow expected it to take us some time, but alas, it didn't. Baby boy should show up around Christmas and I wouldn't want it any other way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like it‘s just one of those things that change you a bit. It definitely hasn’t ruined my life and I‘m a happy person now! But some part of me used to believe that cheating is something that only happens to others, like I was immune to it. It took me some time to get comfortable in my new identity as a „woman that has been cheated on“, but I‘ve gotten there. It‘s certainly not my most identifying feature, but it‘s something that (alongside many other experiences - good and bad) I‘ll carry with me for the rest of my life.

I‘m certain you‘ll find a new balance, a new normal and a way to - one day - happily coexist with the painful events you‘re currently going through.

As for me: I am happily married to the love of my life, a man that respects me and my feelings and is so far away from even considering cheating that some would consider boring. We‘re currently expecting our first child and I wish my ex and his wife all the best. I must admit though: I‘m not distraught at all that they happen to live in a different country.

Fun fact: My ex‘s wife and my husband happened to take a class together. That was...awkward. I sometimes picked him up from class and felt oddly empowered when I realised she kept storming off as soon as I was in sight. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He told me via E-mail. I called him, so we could at least speak about it like adults. We were long distance at the time and after some thinking I decided that we could out this behind us. Turns out he didn't want to put it behind him and was hoping for me to break up with him, so he could be with her. At that point I agreed it was over, but insisted he needed to have the balls and say it out loud.

I took a couple of days off work and went to stay with a friend, crying myself to sleep every night. One morning I came into the living room, where her son (3 at the time?) was building stuff with Lego Duplo. I asked what he was building and he replied: "A swimming pool. But it isn't for you." That was what I needed. Yes, my situation sucked and yes, I was right to be upset. But the world continued turning and trying to drown myself in pity wouldn't get me anywhere. The snotty 3 year old certainly wouldn't treat me like the fragile little creature I believed myself to be. And then I started healing.

That's forever ago now, but the rift inside of me is still there and the pain of being betrayed by a person I loved and trusted had certainly changed me. Luckily, I managed not to turn any of it into jealousy or controlling behaviour. I might be mildly over attached though.

On the plus side: He ended up marrying her, so at least on his side it was worth it. </TEXT>

Poiché la storia dipende sempre da chi la racconta, ci sono certamente persone a cui l‘uso del termine da fa fastidio. Non si può però generalizzare dicendo „ai sudtirolesi“ il termine non piace. Non si può nemmeno generalizzare per un specifico gruppo linguistico, oppure per tutti i cittadini di una certa identificazione politica.

Ciò che si può dire è che è un termine contestato, ma comunemente utilizzato (anche perché la denominazione italiana ufficiale è: Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano - Alto Adige). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Congratulations! I respect your choice, but I find that recommendation interesting. I haven't read the whole study, but it seems like there are no changes in outcome for the baby and only a minor reduction in likelihood of having a cesarean. It seems like having a doula present is more effective at reducing the risk of cesarean than early elective induction is.

<TEXT> Today, 26+3, is a good day.

I contacted all the people at work that need to deal with me leaving earlier than planned, so now it's up to them to sort out the chaos I've caused (two university lab groups need a new lecturer for the semster starting in 11 days) and it's officially off my desk.

Then I went to get a long awaited haircut, marking the beginning of my impeding transition into a soccer mom.

With that done and over with, I can now focus on two big deadlines that will be my last pre-maternity deeds, before my maternity leave starts in (if I googled correctly) 22 work days! I'm sor excited. One thing is writing the second most important presentation of my career so far, the other is working the reviewers' numerous comments into an article. I can do this!

I also feel bad to continue gloating about my long ass mat leave, while so many of you are out there struggling, having to work against their wishes. Feel free to hate me, if it helps at all! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey Josie, thanks for your input! I definitely value the time after the baby‘s arrival more, which is why we initially planned to apply for „flexibility“, as they call the procedure to get clearance not to start maternity 2 months pre-partum (which else happens automatically).  What I didn‘t make very clear in my previous post is that I would still stay at home 6 months post partum, as we would be able to afford 3 months at 30% thanks to my husband‘s new job.

Case numbers have been rising here, if not drastically, but steadily. Precautions are a bit of a mixed bag, the train station/platform is crowded with people without masks and on the train everyone wears one, but uncovered noses and people taking them off for a phone call/snack are common. Unlike at the height of the 1st wave, people are also allowed to occupy every single seat on the train, so you‘re really stacked. The exposure time of 30 min is also long enough to be worth a thought.

At work, our precautions are quite good. Students have to wear masks upon arrival and get their temperature measured. Physical distancing for students is guaranteed and if the room is too small for the group, they get split into two rooms. In pre-covid, this would have been a laboratory entailing lots of group work, where the group working phases were some sort of down time for me. Now it will be more lecture style, as we also have to video record the whole thing for non attending students.

I was briefly considering swapping lectures: I learned that they still haven’t found a lecturer for my lecture with 3rd year students (online only!), so I thought I‘d just take that back, get rid of the laboratories and work happily ever after. But the more I think about it, the more I feel like just going the easy route and avoiding all the stress these new teaching and learning situations entail, not because I have to, but because I can.

This will likely be my one and only pregnancy and my work and life have been mentally demanding for at least the past 6 years - so I think I just want to take a break, spare my baby the stress hormones and get into full blown nesting mode.

I wanted to discuss the pro and cons with my husband yesterday and was met with: „It‘s ok. Nothing to discuss. If you want to go on leave, you should it“. So yes, I think I have taken my decision. I‘m still hoping for the gyn to reject the application, so I don‘t feel guilty for dropping out last minute, but I‘ll go through with it, even if she greenlights my lectures.

I‘ll go on maternity leave in 5 weeks, at 31+2! <3 Wasn‘t it just yesterday that I wondered how big of a deal a SCH at the 12 week scan is?! Time‘s flying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tomorrow I migh need to take a decision.

My husband is a freelancer (i.e. no social security, varying income) and once my mandatory maternity leave of 5 months is over, I'll only get paid 30%. We agreed that I'll take one month pre-partum and 6 months post, that was a compromise between my strong desire to have some proper baby time (and breastfeeding without/with less pumping stress) and our financial needs. That way we only need to bridge 2 months at 30% income.

Yesterday, my midwife told me that the gynaecologist might not agree with my decision (to take 1 month pre-partum, rather than the standard 2 months), seen as my work entails lecturing in presence of quite a few students and communting via public transport. My pregnancy is textbook, but she's concerned about Corona risks and will let me know tomorrow.

That made think... what if she gives her ok? Do I actually want to continue working? Do *I* want to take the risks? Do I want to put up with 30min train rides and 4 hours lectures up until 34+2?

Our financial situation has changed as well, seen as my husband has scored a 1-year contract at a high school, so he'll have as steady and substantial income all the way until the baby is 8 months old!

So I'm finding myself hoping the doctor won't allow me to stay at work, and wondering what to do if she oks it. But then again, who am I kidding? I guess I've actually already taken my decision.

In 24hrs I'll know for sure whether I have 9 weeks left at work or only 5. </TEXT>

We were very lucky that they recently lifted the ban on presence at sonograms though, so he was able to attend the big 20-week anatomy scan, which I awesome, and truly hope something like this will be possible for you as well.

There's not a lot of detail here, but it sounds like the director handled it perfectly as well: She took the situation seriously, spoke with the teacher, didn't turn it into a drama AND put her face out first speaking with you this mornig, rather than pulling the old "You go and apoligise to Mrs Skr000, or else..."-card.

The teacher definitely was in the wrong! It's not only the police/jail part, but the underlying dynamic of lying and threatening. Seen as everyone (you and your son included) reacted appropriately, she might be able to learn from it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like someone needs a spending goal.

It seems like you have all your figures in check: You have a budget, you save money, you don't need help with that. You probably also know how much you HAVE to spend each month (fixed expenses), and how much you COULD spend.

All you need to do is treat your spending money with the same scrutiny as your saving money. Make short term and long term spending goals: 70$ a month for dining out, 2000$ by October 2021 on a holiday.

When you go through your budget at the end of the month and realise that - yet again - your savings account is growing, but miserably failed at your spending goals, it's time to act. Invite a friend out, get house plant for your mum, attend that overpriced touristy event in town or donate to charity.

Work on it, because if you can't get rid of that mentality, you'll never be able to reap the fruits of your current frugality. In 10 years time you'll just switch to saving for in 15 years time and so on and so forth. </TEXT>

I get that too! Just that it's not limited to my pelvis, but it's a whole body thing. In the morning/after getting up from my desk chair after a long time seated I'm just all rusty and move like 90-year-old. Then after soem movement I'm fine again, like you said. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just learned that there's a work event in my mum's hometown 6 days after I had intended to start my maternity leave. It would be awesome to go, because:

- It's a really interesting event I would benefit from professionally, both regarding contents and networking opportunities.

- I do have the budget and if I don't spend it before my mat leave, it'll just disappear.

- It would give me a good reason to push my mat leave back by a week (thus leaving me one additional week after birth).

And, obviously, I could see my mum, family and friends one more time before the birth.

But... the event ends 24 days before the due date and is 9 hours from home. Is that cutting it short? Taking my husband with me wouldn't be an option and I really, really, really want him there when I give birth. This is my first child, I was 10 days late, he was 3 weeks early. How likely is it for the baby to suddenly appear 24 days early?

I'll definitely consult my midwife, but I'd love to have everyone's opinion (leaving Corona aside...). </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the pain goes away as soon as you're actually standing? That doesn't sound too bad! Pregnancy pains are so odd though.

I'll reach the 3rd trimester in 10 days and have been having pain in my right hip for the past 14 days or so. I also suspect sleeping oddly as the culprit: maybe my leg is too high on the pregnancy pillow, so the angle of the hip is odd all night?

I wouldn't know how your position can cause pelvic pain though. But then again: Anything is possible in pregnancy, it seems! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mir ist sie das definit wert. Bei mir (Italien) zahlt mal 60€ beim öffentlichen Zahnarzt, muss dafür ewig warten und zweimal hinrennen. Das habe ich bisher immer brav gemacht, aber meine Zeit ist mehr wert. Beim privaten ZA kostet es 100€ (20% Rabatt wenn man auf die Rechnung verzichtet), die ich von der Steuer absetzen kann. Ich bekomme innerhalb von 4 Wochen einen Termin und muss nur einmal hinrennen.

Fun fact: Die öffentliche Zahnärztin meinte 1,5 Jahre nach meinem letzten Besuch, eine Zahnreinigung sei noch nicht nötig. Auf ausdrücklichen Wunsch habe ich dann dennoch eine bekommen. Die private möchte das gerne alle 6 machen "Weil wenn was ist sieht man das dann früher". Ist klar. Ich gehe alle 12 Monate und gut ist, mit Rechnung bitte. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tendenziell reagieren die Teststreifen früher eindeutig als die Plastidinger aus der Apotheke/Drogerie. Sobald ein kleiner Schatten sichtbar ist, ist das Ergebnis positiv. Teststreifen mit roter Farbe (z.B. One Step) sind früher eindeutig lesbar als Tests mit blauer Farbe. Das ist aber alle nur ein paar Wochen ab Eisprug relevant, wenn du wirklich seit 4-8 Wochen befruchtet bist sollte jeder Test anspringen, auch wenn ihn nachmittags nach 2 Litern Wassertrinken machst.

Dass unmittelbar nach Absetzen eines hormonellen Verhütungsmittels der Zyklus nicht zurückkehrt ist nicht ungewöhnlich.

<TEXT> I'm currently pregnant with a child we will raise. Incidentally, in the two years before my pregnany, I had a lot to do with research in the field of early childhood education.

I learned a lot and one of the authors that stuck with me most is Winnicott, with his concept of a "good enough parent". There are different readigns of this, but a good enough parents responds to the distress signals the infant gives and tries to interpret them in order to reinstate a sense of wellbeing. They also don't shy away from correcting their actions when they realise their interpretation and the following action were wrong. Basically, it's the parents job to make sure the baby doesn't realise (too early) how helpless they actually are, because a parent (caregiver) magically appears and fixes the world for them.

Another aspect I like about this concept, one that Winnicott definitely didn't intend, is that it takes a lot of pressure of chasing perfectionism away. I hope to be able not to chase the idea of being a perfect, or even just awesome or great parent. Being a human is hard, let alone being a parent. So the goal I'm setting for myself is being "good enough". Good enough to keep my son safe, to make sure his needs are met and that he feels loved. I'm fully committed to making tons of mistakes, but I'll also be proactive and open about fixing them.

In that reading, it seems like you're a good enough parent, by making sure the world around your children is fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My diet is mainly plant based and I had heavy meat craving throughout the first trimester. The second trimester was alright, but now (25 weeks) they‘re picking up again.

I had the same hypothesis as you, guess we tend to try and interpret things, but my iron levels have been completely fine at the beginning and are still good (though lower) now. I never took iron supplements.

My two cents:

- It‘s probably just one of those pregnancy quirks and has nothing to do with iron. Some people get into weird combos, we want meat.

- Seen as I freshly obsessed over my blood works yesterday I can assure you that, digging into it, you‘ll find that mild anaemia isn’t usually an issue for mom or baby.

Seen as you appear to be concerned, calling your doctor is a good next move. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We do German/English OPOL with Italian  and German as a community languages. I’m C2 in English, my husband a passive A2 in German with little but growing active vocabulary. My Italian is C1 and his B2.

We speak English to each other, 1) because we always have and 2) it‘s the non-community language which needs to be fostered most (as someone else commented as well).

With friends, we speak Italian or English, many of our friends actually want to practice their English with us, which is fine. Our German speaking family used to speak mainly English when my husband‘s around, but with the baby they‘re switching to German only and my husband will need to catch up, eventually. If there’s important stuff, we can still translate.

Italian isn’t a focus at all, the baby will learn it at daycare and school.

Out of curiosity: what made you decide to raise your child bilingually and what hopes and expectations do you connect with it? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see. We‘ll need to play tetris as well to make it work, but it doesn’t seem to be as dire as your situation.

If you‘re committed to staying put (which sounds financially reasonable), there‘s a lot one can do to optimise the use of space. It doesn’t sounds like you‘re working with perfect conditions though.

If you decide to buy, you should factor your planned maternity leave (and a little extra) into your budget and mortgage. If you get more money than you‘ll need and spend less on a house than you‘d be able to, the financial stress should be minimal.

I think one of the big issues with first time home owners is that the commitment seems so huge that they tend to go for „perfect and forever“ rather than „reasonable and within our budget“. So instead of buying the three bedroom suburban standalone house with a garden, maybe go with the 2 bedroom condo close to a public park for now.

I‘m not sure how rent and property prices currently compare where you are, but we currently pay 500€ rent (which our landlord knows to be insanely low!) and there‘s no chance in hell we‘d be able to find property at that amount mortgage payment. We‘d have to at least double the monthly payment (let alone the down payment) and would still need to downgrade somewhere (move into condo, further away from public transport, shittier neighbourhood...). But luckily nobody is offering us money, so we‘re not in that pickle :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> We‘re on team „waiting“. Looking for, buying and moving into a house is stressful and not something I‘d like to tackle while pregnant/having a newborn.

Financially, our situation is quite similar (I have savings, he doesn’t; our joint account has a 2000€ emergency fund, which is ridiculous). We live in a very small, very cheap, but otherwise perfect rental apartment (fenced garden, bus stop, awesome neighbours...) and are planning on staying here as long as we can make it work.

It‘s only 43sqm, so we have one bedroom (with baby), one living room/double office/guest bedroom, one kitchen/dining room. The baby‘s changing table is in the hallway.

Financially speaking, I will be able to access my pension fund in 6 years time and before that there‘s no chance in hell we‘d be able to afford a mortgage on our own. My mum and brother would jump in if we asked them to right now, but I prefer they use their money to buy property for my mum. My husband’s family might be able to pitch in, but I‘m not very well informed about their financial situation.

So our plan is to stay here until probably age 3-5 and move to a bigger rental until I can access my pension. Staying here for the whole 6 years might be a bit too much.

What‘s your stress to buy right now? </TEXT>

Chiedendo il range dell'età ti porta a mancare informazioni potenzialmente utili. Se tutti i rispondenti hanno tra i 25 e i 44 anni, non saprai mai se l'età c'entra qualcosa o meno. Meglio chiedere l'etá esatta in anni e poi definire i brackets in base a chi risponde.

Una domanda che mi pare essenziale per la tua tesina è quella se il rispondente ha mai pensato ad offrire un'attività e-commerce. Mettiamo caso che "Sí, ci ho pensato, ma non l'ho ancora fatto", le possibilità di scelta che il rispondete ha sono "Sì, ma mi sembra una fregatura" e "Sì, ma non saprei dove iniziare". Cosa clicca uno che "Sì, ma mi mancavano le conoscenze tecniche" o "Sì, ma poi ho avuto altri progetti"? Meglio dare opzioni più aperte tipo 1) Sì, lo faccio attualmente, 2) Sì, ma non l'ho ancora rrealizzato e 3) Sì, ma poi ho cambiato idea; e poi fargli (se ti può servire) aggiunge una descrizione più dettagliata nei commenti.

<TEXT> One day, we would like to buy a house. Our expectations for the house are different, but complementary/congruent.

My husband wants to have a garage in which he can run some sort of community gym for neighbours and friends to join him training. I don‘t care for the gym at all, but I love the community aspect of it. My number one housing priority is a garden, which I imagine him and his gym pals will appreciate for their post-workout drink and chat.

It would be easy for either of us to dismiss the other‘s ideas as unnecessary or not affordable, but while I cringe at the cost of gym equipment and my husband cringes at the amount of work caring for a garden takes, we appreciate each others priorities and view them as joint investments into our respective mental health and mutual well-being.

Beim Bewerbungsgespräch selber gibt es vielleicht auch Möglichkeiten für dich zentrale Elemente (z.B. gerechter Lohn) so zu formulieren, dass sie beim Arbeitgeber nicht so rüberkommen, dass du nicht motiviert seist.

For paper, cardboard, glass/tins and plastic, there are publicly accessible recycling containers everywhere in town for you to take it to. The more you out into those, the less you put into your garbage bins and the less you pay. To disincentive abuse (i.e. throwing garbage into recycling to save money), there‘s a minimum of full bins you pay for each year, even if you never put one out. The system isn’t perfect, but it works ok. Oh and you also have a compost bin for organic waste that they empty for free. </TEXT>

I knew she had gotten the message when she actually asked me if I wanted a pregnancy diary and if I had any preferences. I gave her free range on that one and I love the one she chose.

We live in different countries so when it comes to the registry I have the additional lever of saying it's cheaper if I buy it from our national amazon store (which she doesn't speak the language of), because the shipping costs if she buys it in her country would make it more expensive. It's perfect! I buy things and she just says "I pay for it" or "Your aunt offered to pay for that one".

<TEXT> I’ve always wanted two or more and I still do. I know I can’t project my own experience/expectations about sibling relationships onto the next generation and make it magically happen, but: I lost a parent in my 20s and during that time heavily leaned on my brother. My remaining parent is single and will become elderly and more dependent at some point and I’m glad my brother and I will be able to share responsibilities and time.

My husband’s family, my family and our own family live in three different countries. I grew up surrounded by cousins and this sort of informal close to daily gathering is ingrained in my concept of childhood. It’s hard (not impossible) to recreate that with non-related families and my child will grow up without any family member other than their parents. I’d want for them to have a sibling.

Having said that: we’ll probably be OAD. My husband has a neurodevelopmental diagnosis and has difficulties dealing with stress. Work, education and the coming baby are huge stressors to him that are taking a toll on his mental health.

I’m still hoping that once the baby is older and my husband has finished his degree, he’ll be in a different place mentally. Maybe I’ll be able to pull most the financial burden and he’ll be able to work/parent part time each, as best works out for him.

Ultimately, it’s down to him though. Parenting the way we envision it is a two-man show and I’m not going to sacrifice my husband’s mental health in order to chase my idealises image of siblinghood. I rather have a single child with a sane father. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grandmother had her first child at 33 - and then went on to have another 8, I think she was 43 with the youngest. This was in the 1950s to 1960s, so naturally things like antenatal care/diagnosis have rapidly improved since.

I see more mature parents worried about not being around for milestones in their child’s lives, or not being fit enough to do certain things. My grandma never played football with my dad, but I doubt she would have at age 20. She tutored (maths, latin, french) most of her grandchildren and is still around now, with four great-grandchildren (kindergarten to primary school age) and two more on the way.

I’m aware this is purely anecdotal, but older parents can live an awesome family life and the version of that life being different to how it would have been 15 years earlier doesn’t mean it’s any less awesome, wholesome and loving. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just another anecdote to confirm what everyone’s been saying: I did my BAs, MA & PhD at the same institution and was hired by them straight after for a 3 year post-doc, we don‘t have tenure track positions. All applications for my position had done their PhD at our institution though.

My supervisor keeps telling me how I‘ll need to leave and work somewhere else after my contract runs out. She‘s also super critical of (the career path of) a colleague of mine who did his BA and MA elsewhere, but PhD, postdoc, and now tenure with us.

So from my tiny corner: Diverse experience is recommended, staying at your alma mater forever is not impossible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I would like to share the saga of the birth preparation course. I don't care too much about the knowledge side of things, but seen as we don't have any family in this country, I was hoping to meet some fellow soon-to-be parents to start building my village.

The family counceling centre that is the primary care provider for my pregnancy (midwife appointments) organises a preparation course that I was really excited about attending, also because it's run by my midwife, which I love. When she was finally able to tell me the dates, I learned it's all Monday morning! Really? I can nearly accepted the world expecting me to stay home after giving birth (thoguh that won't be the case, because bills), but three month prior I was really planning on working. Her response was: "Don't worry, we'll provide you with a justification for abstence." Basically they can issue you with a slip that says you need paid time off for medical needs. I lecture university students, pretty sure my Faculty wouldn't be overly excited about me just skipping that 5 weeks in a row. Oh, and the 3 appointments the dads are invited to are scheduled at night - who could expect a man to miss work?

So I called a different family counseling centre, who run their course at night. Whoo whoo! The only night of the week and exactly the time of the year when I'm attending the only pregnancy yoga course I could find. That's another no.

Luckily, the public health care system offers a course as well, which I was hoping would introduce the hospital side of things in-depth, seen as it's run by the same people. That could be interesting! And, in an unprecedent move of userfriendliness they post their appointments online! ...omitting the fact that all courses have been cancelled due to covid.

Next family counceling centre it is. Sound great, they have some mom-only appointments, some with the couple, and two dad-only sessions with a psychologist (whom I happend to know and dislike professionally, but I wouldnt be involved, so ok). They have the dates, the dates work - but they don't know how many people can attend due to covid. They offer a place on a waiting list without detailing when we would know the verdict.

Now I'm down to my last straw. The hyper religious route. I'm an atheist and my husband is an unbaptised agnostic, so they just weren't on my radar. Their course is online-only (I would have preferred in presence), takes place at night and all appointments are for the whole couple! Colour me surprised, the catholic centre is more progressive than I imagined. Once more I learned that prejudices take you nowhere, or maximum onto a detour.

Long story short: We signed up with the online course, hoping they'll manage to replace their pediatrician on time, who just so happened to quit her job today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I‘m so sorry to hear that.

My dad died unexpectedly of a series of heart attacks as well, when he was 54. That was 5 years prior to my first and current pregnancy, but it still affects me.

Unlike you, I had the chance to process the initial grief over the loss of my father way before even trying for a baby, so that‘s different.

What I‘m mourning now is the grandfather he‘ll never get to be and the grandfather our son will never get to have. After his birth in December, I am planning on sending out a letter to all of my relatives and close friends of my dad, asking them to share memories with our son.

I have a lifetime of memories with my dad - my son will only know him trough stories. So I‘m hoping my family will record videos telling their favourite anecdotes from my dad, share stories of when he touched/annoyed/surprised them, to help our son form his own image of the grandpa he‘ll never get to meet, but who’s such an important person (still) in the life of his mother.

My husband and I also have a tradition of celebrating my dad‘s birthday together (rather than commemorating the anniversary of his death) and I‘m planning on involving our son in the celebration from birth. It involves movies, food and candy, so I‘m sure he‘ll love it! Once he‘d allowed candy, of course...

The loss of a parent is brutal and the pain doesn’t leave. I try to remind myself where the pain comes from - from the profound love you have for your father - and celebrate that.

All the best, feel hugged. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lost my dad unexpectedly when I was 28. Every year since, my husband and I have celebrated his birthday (and life) by watching one of the movies I used to watch with him when I was a child (all of the horrible Leslie Nielsen comedies, Indiana Jones, Animals are beautiful people...) and eating irresponsible amounts of his favourite snacks.

Other than the gifts he gave me during his lifetime (a guitar, my iMac...) I don‘t have any physical reminders of him, because his death came in a weird moment in life. I don‘t miss those physical things, but I‘m thinking of asking my aunts and uncle (he had seven siblings) to write down or audio/video record their favourite stories/anecdotes of him.

What I grieve most is that my dad will never get to meet my son (currently pregnant with our first) and be the awesome granddad I know he would have been. I have a lifetime full of memories with my dad, but my son will only know him through the stories we tell him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I‘m in Italy and get 5 months of fully paid maternity leave. The classic division is 2 months pre- and 3 months post-partum, but as long as your doctors ok it you can postpone it flexibly, up until the due date. Those 5 months are your right and everyone gets them, independently of employment status and contract. The wage is paid by social security, rather than the employer (as far as I know).

After that it depends on your contract and seen as I have one of the shittier ones, I can take up to 9 months of paternity leave before the child turns 9 years old, those are paid at 30%.

What‘s more, once you return to work you get two hours „nursing break“ a day, which you may move to the beginning/end of your workday, until the child‘s first birthday. So effectively, you work a 75% job at 100% pay during the first year.

For all the shit Italy‘s getting compared to other European countries, it‘s pretty decent. I just wish my paternity was paid at 60% rather than 30%.

Current plan: start maternity 1 month pre-partum, have 4 months post partum left, add 2 months of paternity at 30% percent and return to work at 75% load when the child is 6 months old. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Holiday mood! I‘m 21+4 today and just arrived at my holiday destination in the Austrian Alps. Many people look for sunshine and beaches for their summer holiday, while I‘m excited to escape the heat of my city. I‘m currently wearing long trousers, which I haven’t in forever, and I‘m looking forward to actually using a blanket when I‘ll go to bed tonight.

I left my luggage at the tourist information (very kind of them) and am now enjoying my lunch (bread roll with avocado, tomato from my friend‘s garden, some plums) on a bench in a park by the river.

My mum is on her way here and is ecstatic to get to spend 6 days with me and the bump and I‘m sure she‘ll get a chance to feel her grandson kick for the first time.

We‘ll do mountain hikes and, weather permitting, get to swim in the lake. We also booked breakfast and dinner at our hotel, so no groceries, cooking and dishes for 6 days!

Bliss <3

Update: First walk done, still fitter than my mum despite the bump :) The food is amazing! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For my husband (who is diagnosed with ADHD), people, hobbies, chores and even I are the same thing. He keeps a schedule for meeting friends the same way he schedules doing chores. If a friend is not in his brain-support-app, he likely won‘t see them anytime soon.

Him and I also schedule our couple time, just to make sure it‘s happening. And I‘m not saying planning date nights, it more like „tomorrow before dinner we can discuss when to install the new curtains“ and „Wednesday evening we can watch a movie“.

Even with people he likes, socialising remains exhausting for him. When he‘s had a stressful period and needs to recover a little, I know not to invite people over, but rather meet them outside so he has the option to simply not come.

Adult ADHD is under diagnosed and often misdiagnosed. If you found any of the strategies that you mentioned helpful to structure your day and chores, they might also he helpful to structure your social life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> - Funziona a base del sistema „envelope saving“, dove assegni un compito a ogni € che guadagni.

- Su un account puoi avere più budget: Noi abbiamo il budget di famiglia, il mio privato e il suo privato.

- I tuoi obiettivi di budget posso essere mensili (50€ al mese per gli aperitivo), entro una certa data (la polizza di 200€ che scade a settembre, oppure una somma specifica (finché arrivi a 600€ per il nuovo laptop). Nel caso della data fissa, il programma ti dice ogni mesi quanti devi metterci per arrivarci in tempo.

- Se usi la funzione della geolocalizzazione, l‘app riconosce quando esci dalla coop piuttosto che da Lidl, quindi se immetti la spesa effettuata subito sul parcheggio, lui ti aggiunge la voce „coop“ in automatico.

- A parte il budget e i soldi „cash“ (contanti, cc, carta di credito...) puoi anche aggiungere i risparmi/investimenti a lungo termine, che ovviamemte non userai per comprarti lo scooter l‘anno prossimo. L‘app tiene separato quello che è a disposizione del budget, e ciò che vuoi solo tenedere sott‘occhio. Io lì ho anche il mio fondo pensione e gli ETF.

- Come in una buona dieta, non ti devi deprivare di niente e sei tu che controlli tutto. Se la tua priorità sono 70€ al mese per il sushi, allora sei tu che metti questo goal al primo piano. Ovviamente il tuo budget sarà efficace quanto lo sei tu.

- Dopo qualche tempo hai una visione reale su quanto spendi veramente. Il primo anno tenevo un fondo „Prosecco“ che mi ha aperto gli occhi :)

- Puoi essere dettagliato quanto vuoi: O immetti come “spesa” tutto ciò che compri, oppure - come noi - dividi per “alimentari”, “pulizia” e “igiene”. Sono ricercatrice, i dati mi rendono felice.

- Una volta impostato le tue macrocategorie (nel caso della nostra famiglia: 1) Risparmi, 2) Università, 3) Paghette (soldi da investire e spendere per me e mio marito), 4) Spese immediate (affitto, bollette), 5) Spese vere (mediche, assicurazioni), 6) Bambino* (vestiti di maternità, abbigliamenti, accessori), 7) Debiti (molto in basso semplicemente perché non ne abbiamo, ma ci teniamo la categoria per motivi motivazionali), 8) Qualità di vita (ferie, mangiare fuori, attività), saprai quanto spendi per quale causa.

*Non per presentargli la fattura al 18esimo compleanno, ma mi interessa sapere quanto costa il nostro figlio.

- Protezione anti-impulso: L’app del cellulare ha funzionalità ridotte, ad esempio non puoi modificare gli obiettivi di budget sul cellulare, ma solo dal PC (e tablet immagino). Credo ciò sia per renderlo più intenzionale. </TEXT>

I love both the sound and looks of it though, so I might feel into again tomorrow. I also only know Max‘s that are excellent people, that‘s a plus.

Edit: Especially with the French U, that becomes a whole different name. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Our son will be British and German and he‘ll grow up in Italy. We‘d like to avoid name related trouble (pronunciation, spelling issues, uncertainty about gender...) for him as far as possible.

I would have loved to find a name that‘s pronounced the same in all three of our languages, but I‘ve come to terms with that being too tricky.

Current shortlist:
- Mattia
- Samuel
- Ben
- Emil
- Emmett

Simon and Jonathan also made the list, but we don‘t want to use names of close relatives.

I could post a list of names my husband has vetoed, but it‘s loooong. Short selection: Louis/Louie, Theo, Matteo, Jamie, Emilio/Emiliano, Charlie, Lucas, Milo, Elio/Elia, Leon/Leo, Kian, Paul.

Our last name is one syllable, British and starts with a T, which makes me question Emmett big time.

Any ideas?

I currently favour Emil and Mattia, but I‘m not head-over-heals into either.

EDIT:

Names I’ve added to the maybe pile:

- Max

Recurring suggestions:

- Alexander
- Felix
- Anton/Antonio/Anthony
- Marco/Marcus
- Luca/Lucas </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Italian we don‘t actually pronounce the I like in CHEE, but it softens the C, so it‘s not pronounced like K.

It‘s Lou-CHA-na, with CHA like in the Cuban dance cha-cha-cha.

So that makes it three possible pronunciations already. I agree with you, I also prefer names that have one dominant intuitive pronunciation. Luciana is lovely though! </TEXT>

- Celeste (sky blue)

- Ginevra (Swiss city Geneva)

- Bella (beautiful)

- Chiara (clear/fair)

- Placido (placid/peaceful)


There‘s many more than that. A few have been commenting how basically every name has a meaning, but I feel like your post is about names that don‘t just mean something, but are an actual word used in that language to denominate that concept. I find these names odd as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My cousin lived with his aunt (cousin’s mum’s sister) and my dad (she‘s my dad‘s second wife) for a couple of years and everyone involved - including my cousin - is convinced it saved his arse.

In a whirlwind combination of having no relationship with his biological father, being bullied at school and being an unmotivated emo school absentee (hard to say what‘s the chicken what‘s the egg - it was egg), my cousin was risking getting kicked out of school for good at age 15.

His mum, who has her flaws and parental shortcomings like we all do, was at her wit’s end and so deep in everything that she‘d basically thrown in the towel. As a last resort and after long consultations my stepmom and dad, they devised the plan of my cousin moving in with them until graduating secondary school.

The whole thing wasn‘t without challenges and difficulties and at some point the relationship between my cousin and my dad was so strained, my dad had basically stopped talking to him.

Teenage years are incredibly difficult, but they‘re also not necessarily life defining. Through joint efforts on all sides (oftentimes asynchronous, which can be frustrating), lots of growing up, an immense amount of love and the simple magic of times passing, it all ended up working out.

My cousin graduated high school, worked his ass off (both physically and academically) to get accepted into police school, Aced all his classes there, became an officer, did the German equivalent of taking his A-levels on the job and now is a home owner, a dad and a full-time Economics student on police payroll. His relationship with my dad had recovered (before my dad passed away) and his relationship with both his mum and my stepmom is fantastic.

Coming to your situation: It hurts and sucks and will continue doing both for a long time. Whichever path your child ends up choosing will be long, windy, painful and full of setbacks. The only thing you and him probably agree on at the moment is: Things can‘t continue they way they are now. Take it from there, one step at a time. Take a snapshot of right now and whenever, a year down the road you feel like everyone‘s failing, take a close look at that snapshot and reconsider. He can make it. </TEXT>

My cousin and his fiancée, who live in a different country, decided to join in and watch the same movie as us. Today’s pick was Indiana Jones: Raiders of the lost arch.

<TEXT> Today is my dad's birthday and baby's 20+0. This morning, when I was lying in bed, I was texting with a friend who asked me if I could feel kicks yet. I told her I felt movement, but nothing that I could feel through my tummy. The baby immediately corrected that statement by starting to perform a gymnastics routine in there that I could clearly feel with my hand and after two attempts even my husband felt the baby move for the very first time! That was definitely a special moment.

My dad passed away 5 years ago and never got the chance to be the amazingly loving and annoying jokester grandpa I know he would have been. Rather than commemorating the day he died, my husband and I have a ritual of celebrating his life by watching one of the movies I used to watch with him when I was a child and eating all the unhealthy food he loved so much.

Today's a good day and between my dad, the rolling baby and my wonderful husband I'm a bit overwhelmed by love and feels. Happy birthday, dad! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it’s a fabulous name for both children and adults, not too long, yet lots of nickname potential (Rose, Rosie, Mary...).

I recently re-read the book by Ira Levin and even then I’d think of the herb before I’d think of the book.

I imagine how annoying it must be to have people continuously comment on it. The best strategy is probably to get a standard reply ready, so you can stop getting emotionally involved every time someone says it.

“Rosemary as in Rosemary” could work or (if you prefer more aggressive get backs) “Let’s hope she won’t end up marrying a creep/getting pregnant by the devil”. That should remind people that they’re talking about your lovely child and not some horror movie freak. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can imagine how hard this must be on her, trying to pass on her language while your son appears to refuse it.

My advice is - as difficult as this might be for her - to not stress it. She should continue using only Japanese with him, while he should be free to use whichever language he prefers with her. Implementing methods of “forcing” him to use Japanese might actual lead him to associate stress or negative feeling with the language, which wouldn’t be beneficial at all. He’s still learning the language by using it passively only, maybe one day he’ll come around.

If it’s possible for you to interact with other Japanese speaking families, that might be worth a try. Maybe when there’s lots of people or other children using Japanese (in a fun/play setting - not school like!) he might feel comfortable using it as well.

All the best for your family!

Edit: Sorry, I mixed up your child’s gender. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You‘re raising a valid point. Apart from the vitamin A (which the other commenters are clearly more knowledgeable on than I am), your needs for supplementation will depend on your diet and other factors specific to you. For that reason, I‘m not a fan of „one for all“ complexes and instead buy individual supplements based on my specific needs. My prenatal care provider knows about them, added one, and everything else will be blood result based.

What I take (and this will be different for everyone) is:

- Vitamin B complex: This contains the recommended dosage of folic acid, but seen as my diet is mainly plant bases I went all in with the B vitamins. According to my research, none of them appear to be problematic if slightly over supplemented.

- Fish oil/omega 3: I don‘t usually eat fish, but flaxseed nearly every day. Again, overdosing appears to be no real issue.

- Vitamin D: I live in a sunny place, but due to the lockdown and now the heat I haven’t been spending a lot a time outside. That coupled with a history of depression means I take „vitamin D ‘til the sun shines out of my butt”.

- Zinc: Not pregnancy related, just looked like a good idea and my prenatal care provider ok’d it.

- Iodine: This is the one my OBGYN added, which both I and my midwife found odd. She has since said I could stop taking it as long as I use fortified salt and I will stop taking it as soon aa I run out.

That’s it! Other than that, I make a conscious effort to put magnesium and calcium on my plate everyday, as well as some source of iron. My iron levels get tested regularly and I’m happy to start supplementing as soon as I’m running low, but not before that. I don’t worry about vitamin C, seen as I consume a metric fucktonne of fruit every day that will sooner cause cavities than a vit D deficiency. </TEXT>

Not to be nosy, but I‘m surprised your husband doesn’t speak Yoruba with your son. Is there a reason for this?

As someone else pointed out, from a language learning point of view Spanish it what you least need to worry about. Wouldn’t you want him to have linguistic access to his dad‘s family as well?

I‘m so glad this community exists and I love learning about families like yours. I‘m currently pregnant with our first child who will be exposed to two languages at home and one more language plus one dialect in the environment.

Edit: And good on you for not pushing the issue! There‘s a huge emotional component to language acquisition and „forcing“ a language onto a child can definitely have negative effects. </TEXT>

It's a very serious condition but can be treated quite well with medication. It is scary as hell, but listen to your doctors and you and you and your baby will most likely be fine.

Good to know you're on your way to your doctor, he'll most likely test your bile acid levels, which will be way above 10 μmol/l. They might prescribe you Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to treat the itchiness and lower the bile acids levels in your blood.

Jetzt bin ich schwanger mit unserem ersten Kind und die Professorin von oben tut so, als sei es das tollste auf der Welt. Ich arbeite aber auch nicht mehr so direkt mit ihr zusammen, vielleicht sieht sie das also weniger als "ihr Problem" an. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Breakfast: Coffee, yoghurt, fruit

Lunch: Huge ass salad (typically lettuce, bellpepper, carrots, celery, cucumber, tomatoes, beetrott, olives, nuts, seeds....in varying quantity, with any protein: chickpeas, beans, tofu...)

Dinner: Huge bowl of veggies (stir-fry, curry, steamed vegetables...) with carbs (basmati rice, pasta, couscous...)

That's the theory. In practice I'm pregnant and a had a bowl of oats in addition to breakfast and am currently having my mid-morning noodle soup snack. But I do eat tons of vegetables and prepare/cook two meals a day (not counting breakfast). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Both boys and girls should learn about the the menstrual cycle. I was brought up in a progressive family and school system in Germany that included sex ed based on biological facts. We learned about the cycle, about fertility and both mechanical and hormonal contraception.

Yet, it took my husband‘s encouragement in my late 20‘s to try NFP for me to fully learn how my own cycle works and which symptoms show up when. We ended up not using it for contraception, but through observing my cycle and tracking my symptoms I learned so, so much!

My point being: Teaching about the cycle (or comprehensive sex ed) shouldn’t be a one-off thing, but an ongoing process continuously adapted to the child‘s/person‘s developmental stage, just like any other thing we get taught.

We don‘t teach football for one semester and expect everyone to be a pro at it instantly, why would be expect that‘s how it works with human reproductive biology?

I‘m now in my early 30‘s with a good education and newly pregnant with our first child: I‘m ashamed to say there are very basic things about fertility that I just learned/re-learned in the process of trying to conceive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Io ho frequentato la scuola in Germania e a nove anni ho scelto la mia scuola superiore. Sono andata a vedere le due scuole della mia città (una che frequentava mio fratello, l'altra dove sarei finita in classe con la mia migliore amica).

Ho scelto la scuola una città più in là perché mi permetteva di studiare il francese piuttosto che l'inglese come prima lingua straniera.

Non credo di essere stata stramatura a quell'età, ma sono del parere che la scelta della scuola secondaria (di secondo grado) spetta a chi la deve frequentare e non è che ti rovina la vita se scegli una piuttosto che l'altra.

Poi ammetto: Da più grande volevo pensavo brevemente di abbandonare il liceo prima della maturità per fare un apprendistato, lì si è intromessa mia mamma dicendo che l'apprendistato va benissimia, ma prima finisco la maturità. </TEXT>

Personally, I‘m in a similar pickle (just that it also has to have intuitive pronunciation in German) and personally love Marina, Luisa, Simona, Serena (only if you don‘t live in Italy - I‘m not a fan of adjective-names), Valeria/Valentina and Alessia.

I would avoid „tricky“ name with Ch or Gi, as the pronunciation oftentimes gets messed up. A cousin of mine im Germany is called Gioia and not even her parents pronounce it correctly. Rs can be tricky too, but in some names I don‘t mind if it remains unrolled. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's probably to mount something somewhere.

I would assume the square bit gets fixed onto a surface, using the black screws (who differ in length). Afterwards, the round bit can probably get fixed onto it, using the silver screw (if it's long enough) and the nut.

There are no dowels included, so I suppe it's not made to be screwed into a wall, but onto some other kind of surface. Maybe wood, or something that already has screw holes for the purpose. Is the white square bit a label, or something adhesive? If it's adhesive, the surfaces intended for it to be put on is probably smooth: plastic or tiles.

On the right side of the round bit there's a dent: Could you open they half circle at that point, or is it firmly closed? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hm. Wir haben da gemischte Erfahrungen gemacht. Im Nightjet (ÖBB/DB) war ich mit einer anderen Person im Liegeabteil. Mein Mann hat ein paar Tage später den gleichen Zug genommen und die waren zu fünft im Liegeabteil für vier Personen, weil das Kind wohl kein Ticket brauchte. Dem Zugbegleiter war das herzlich Schnuppe und zu Beginn der Reise kam eine Durchsage dass es ihnen Leid täte, aber man den Sicherheitsabstand heute nicht garantieren könne.

Der ICE auf der Rückfahrt wurde durch einen Ersatzzug ersetzt, dadurch waren Reservierungen größtenteils hinfällig, der Zug war rappelvoll und jeder saß neben jedem und zusätzlich auf dem Boden.

Masken hatten die meisten an, aber oft nur über den Mund gezogen, bei freier Nase. Auf Fernreisen essen/trinken die Fahrgäste auch, da ist dann natürlich nichts mit Mundschutz.

Ironisch an der Sache ist, dass meine Mann auf die Zugfahrt bestanden hatte, weil ihm eine Flugreise zu riskant vorkam. Haha. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ich bin für Event-Küche: Viel Event, wenig Küche. Dafür eignen sich:

- Wraps: Gemüse schnippeln geht zu zweit gut, da brennt nichts an. Eine Soße kann man auch wudnerbar anrühren (wahlweise sour cream, Tsatsiki, Tomatensalsa...) und dann als fulminantes highlight noch EINE frisch gebratene Füllung: Hähnchenbrust mit Currypulver und nem Tropfen Honig, knuspriges Tofu oder auch gerne Champignons in Scheiben oder gewürfelte Zucchini. Schmeckt immer.

- Raclette: Ganz viel Schnippeln, drei Lieblingsaucen (Banane-Quark-Curry ist mega) anrühren, "kochen" muss sie selber.

- Burger. Auch hier muss nur geschnippelt werden, abgesehen vom Burger selber: Hackfleisch matschen ist mega unsexy, vielleicht ein guter Kompatibilitätstest.

Viel Erfolg! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Als wir uns kennengelernt haben war ich Vollzeit beschäftigt und stand kurz vorm Master-Abschluss, er hatte einen Oberschulabschluss und war Teilzeit beschäftigt.

Jetzt habe ich meinen PhD, arbeite Vollzeit, verdiene 1,5 Mal so viel wie er. Er macht eine BA (aus eigener Motivation - mir sind die Abschlüsse egal), arbeitet Teilzeit als Freelancer und hat sich für den Herbst auf öffentliche (Teilzeit-)Stellen beworben.

Er hat also immer weniger verdient als ich und die einzige Konsequenz daraus, die mich hätte stören können wäre, wenn „wir“ und Dinge nicht leisten können weil „er“ sie sich nicht leisten kann. An Anfang der Beziehung haben wir das so gelöst, dass jeder 2/3 des Einkommens an das Gemeinschaftskonto überweist und 1/3 für persönliche Ausgaben behält. Er musste also nie 50% unserer damals teuren Miete bezahlen.

Jetzt bin ich schwanger und wir haben das System angepasst: Unser gesamtes Einkommen kommt auf das Gemeinschaftskonto und wir beide bekommen monatlich Taschengeld und Investmentgeld in der selben Höhe ausgezahlt. Das ist dann fairer, weil wir beide durch die Elternschaft bedingte Verdienstausfälle in unterschiedlicher Höhe haben werden, das trifft ihn voraussichtlich mehr als mich.

Mir waren Status, Abschluss, Karriere (meine und die des Partners) immer schnuppe. Wichtig ist mir, dass mein Partner zum Familienleben beiträgt und sich nicht nur im gemachten Nest ausruht. Wenn ich eine stressige Woche auf der Arbeit habe ist es klar, dass er im Haushalt mehr als seine 50% stemmen muss und das erwarte ich dann auch ohne jammern. Selbes gilt natürlich für mich, wenn er Prüfungsphase hat.

Rezept zum Erfolg ist glaube ich einerseits das penible Finanzkonzept, dass wir von Anfang hatten: wir müssen nur extrem selten über mein/dein/unser Geld diskutieren. Außerdem definieren wir uns und unseren Selbstwert nicht über Abschlüsse, Titel oder Einkommen. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today is not my best day. I went to the pool with my friend and her two children yesterday and sincerely hope that what I‘m experiencing today are symptoms of heat exhaustion.

I woke up tired, despite having slept more than 8hrs and soon after breakfast diarrhoea kicked in and hasn‘t left me since. I also have a mild headache and occasional borderline nausea.

I don‘t think I have a fever and there‘s definitely no coughing, so I feel like I can safely attend my midwife appointment later this afternoon.

In the meantime, I retreated to bed for an unsuccessful nap attempt. Today of all days is the first day my husband does out-of-home work again, so I even have to tend for myself.

Now I‘m in bed with slimey rice soup feeling sorry for myself :)

How‘s everyone else’s day going?

UPDATE: Thanks for your concern everyone. Maybe it wasn’t very clear from my post, but I did have a checkup scheduled for today and, although I learned diarrhoea is on the Corona symptoms list, they agreed to still see me. Baby‘s heartbeat was awesome and the midwife trusts my experience that tells me this feels like typical heat exhaustion for me. Her advice was to keep doing what I‘m doing (stay hydrated) and see my primary care physician if there‘s no drastic improvement by tomorrow. So far I already feel way better: more energetic, need to use the bathroom way less frequently, nausea is completely gone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You’ve already found the answer. As a proud mum you want to have pictures of your precious children and diligently whip out the camera. Others might not feel so strongly about it, so you will need to ask.

Maybe a way to trick yourself is to make it a rule that whenever you decide it’s picture time, the first picture taken will need to be of you and your child. Take out the phone, ask your friend/spouse/relative to take one photo and then allow yourself to snap away. That’s not bugging people.

Also: Thanks for the wake up call! I spent a whole day at the pool with a friend and her two children yesterday and she took photos of me and her 7 month old, but it never occurred to me offer to take some of her. I will next time! </TEXT>

I once read somewhere about loss that times does not heal everything, but times allows you to learnt to coexist with the pain. My worry is like that now. I do worry about our unborn child and I do worry “What if there’s something wrong at the next checkup?”. But these worries are not at the forefront of my mind at all times, they’re more something that patiently accompanies me throughout the day.

<TEXT> Yesterday night I had what I call a „Benefits Britain night“. For me, that‘s a phase (sometimes much longer than a night) where I‘m in a depressive state, can‘t nor want to motivate myself to be kind to myself, but instead do everything I know isn‘t good for me. I‘m not talking about a zero day, it‘s more of a self-destructive day.

My go-to choices for sabotaging my own happiness are:

- Binge eating

- Zero social contact

- Watching depressing documentaries on Youtube (e.g. Benefits Britain)

I‘m fortunate enough to be able to effortlessly maintain a healthy BMI (not slim, just healthy), but I frequently binge eat anything I can find to point of causing stomachache and heartburn. I‘m not talking indulging in a bigger-than-sensitive slice of creamy cheese cake, but just lustlessly inhaling anything I can find. Yesterday, that was a jam lathered pancake I whipped up to satisfy my cravings, followed by two cups of yoghurt (that I actually needed to prepare breakfast for the next days!), followed by a big glass of cocoa. None of it was good.

I was going to take my time and try to organize some aspects of a wedding I‘m in the party of, which will take place on the 18th. Instead I followed the adventures of 3 UK families facing eviction. Brilliant.

When my husband came back from training I just huffed at him and today he heroically (because it was my turn) did the dishes I chose to ignore yesterday.

So much for the backstory, but this is about today: These ruts aren’t easy for me to get out of. Therefore, this morning it took me until 9:30h to muster the strength to get out of bed, but I did it. I had to work and it was pressing, but I also knew that the best way to counteract what happened yesterday was doing the opposite, i.e. doing things that are good for me! So I left the house, walked to the store, got myself a real treat (chocolate brioche) for second breakfast and then took the long and sunny way home for that sweet vitamin D and the general happiness that comes from being outside and moving. This way I racked up 45 min of „exercise“ and felt great when I came home.

I did my work, and set myself little goals that I managed to reach. When my brain was saturated and I felt I needed my break, rather than turning to reddit/news/youtube I finally did the 2nd trimester yoga practice I paid for ages ago, for the first time. I’m so proud of myself! And when it was time for my snack, I not only opted for a healthy version (carrot sticks and yoghurt dip), but I also feel deeply satisfied from it!

A couple of weeks ago, I posted about our joint decision to “live our best lives”. I still like that motto, because “best” is whatever you make, not necessarily chasing societal ideals. On some days though, “be kind to yourself” just is a better fit for me. Today I was kind in allowing myself to leave the house. I chose to feed myself with kind intentions (including a treat!) and I finally, finally was kind to my pregnancy-aching back and did that yoga practice my body and mind had been craving.

TL;DR: Be kind to yourselves, whatever that means to you today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I tried to use the search function, I hope this isn't one of the question asked a thousand times.

I am using a long, direct quote from a source that uses references. Theses references are not in APA, but the publisher I'm writing for requires my chapter to be in APA 7.

Do I:

- change the referencing in the long quote to APA, thus altering the direct quote?

- do I keep the original referencing system in the long quote, which is not APA? To make matters worse, they use footnotes rather than in-text citation.

- do I keep the original referencing format, but move the reference out of the footnote into the main text of the long quote?

I've never come across this problem and would be really greatful to receive any input. </TEXT>

It was delicious!

Today we're having the leftovers of an improvised "General Tso's Chickpeas". I followed a recipe, substituted nearly every singled ingredient in it and it came out great!

<TEXT> Yep, I'm farming some of the same critters. Choice of nom defininitely points towards some species of cabbage loving future butterfly/moth. Either they're cabbage loopers like suggested elsewhere, or your yummy leaves attracted some cabbage whites. Loopers will become moths, whites will become butterflies. Maybe have a look around the garden, depending on where you are one or the other might be more likely, but cabbage whites are typically easy to spot during the day.

I don't know loopers, but I'm currently farming cabbage whites and can attest that - much like in the book - they're very, very hungry indeed. The good news is that cabbage whites are likely to leave your other plants alone. The name is the game and they're very much into anything that has mustardy leaves: Mine are fed on rocket salad and radishes, but they won't touch lettuce, basil or tomato leaves.

Now, unlike me you might not be quite mentally prepared to surrender your crop to future butterflies. In that case a sustainable pest control would be to collect the caterpillars, which aren't too hard to spot once youve trained your eyes, and judging by the size of the chomps they're already quite fit. Mine typically chill on the underside of the leaves in the vicinity of the bite marks/whole, but they also like to hang out along the leaves' stems, pretenting they're part of the stem as well. And once collected, you could donate them to your friendly neighbourhood chickens.

If there are any eggs left, those should be tiny and yellow, but my guess is they've all hatched by now. </TEXT>

So I'll have half a massive ass cucumber with some hummus... followed two slices of bread with with jam. I'm starting to think it would be better to go straigth for the jam, at least I'd save up the hummus calories for tomorrow's jam :)

Today my mid morning snack was a banana/soy milk/pea protein/peanut butter smoothie (for those sweet sweet baby gainz) and afternoon snack was a burger bun (we're out of real bread and I want carbs) with: fig chutney, cabbage, lettuce, gherkin, dried tomatoes, vegan parmesan, smoked salt, ground pepper and ketchup. I'm telling myself it's basically a salad...

<TEXT> You could try and observe the evaporation rate to be better able to guesstimate what subastance it might be: Take a sheet of paper and with a toothpick/back of a spoon transfer one drop of mystery liquid onto the paper. For comparison, do the same with one drop of water, oil, and vodka each.

If it evaporates quickly (speed of vodka) it's probably alcoholic. If it evaporates at the speed of water, I have now clue (ornamental coloured liquid?). If is doesn't evaporate but leaves an oil mark, it's probably an oily substance.

Might help getting a bit closer to the truth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ein gekippter Uterus ist schnurzegal. Das wird nicht als „Anomalie“ sondern als „anatomische Variante“ angesehen. In Schwangerschaften kippt der normalerweise nach vorne wo er hin soll, sobald Gewicht des Kindes und Schwerkraft das ihre tun. Bei mir rechnet man damit, dass das bald der Fall sein wird, falls es nicht schon lange geschehen ist (hatte länger keinen Ultraschall mehr).

Ein verwachsener Uterus ist effektiv ein Problem, aber die Ärztin meinte „Das ist bei Ihnen nicht der Fall. Glauben Sie mir, das wüssten Sie!“ und begründete das mit ebenjenen krassen Regelschmerzen.

Nachdem ich mich ein bisschen informiert habe (google retroflexio uteri, klingt nach Harry Potter) bin ich aber zur Vermutung gekommen, dass dieser Umstand erklären könnte, weshalb ich meine Regelschmerzen primär im Rücken spüre und weniger im Bauchraum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I struggled a lot with finding a new balance in my relationship with my mother as an adult daughter. During my PhD my dad unexpectedly passed away, my husband got diagnosed with ADHD and I had half a burnout. I got counselling and we ended up speaking about was my mum! So yes, it was that bad.

When I was 19, I moved to a different country and my mum is still kind of hoping I‘ll come back. My husband doesn‘t speak my mum‘s language very well and she struggles with his activity levels being lower than mine and (I think) him not being a people pleaser.

For some time that has impacted our relationship in a way that I dreaded contacting her and visiting her. At some point I came to realise: Fuck it.

This is my live and I want it to be as awesome as possible. For me, that includes a good relationship with my mum, who‘s actually a fantastic woman. So I call her several times a week and when and when she crosses boundaries I tell her straight away. After six years she has gotten (largely...) used to my husband and doesn’t shy away from telling him things straight away, that‘s his job to deal with, not mine.

Everything has recovered well enough for the three of us having planned (and covid cancelled) a holiday together this summer. Still, she’s coming over for 2 weeks in December to help out when I‘ll give birth to our first child and everyone involved is actually looking forward to it.

You‘ll need to find your own way and figure out how you can deal with your mum, and how much intrusion you‘re willing to accept. That level is different for everyone and quite low for myself. Good luck with the journey, it‘s a tricky but worthwhile one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would suggest googling any syrup/cordial recipe to make your own and just top it up with sparkling water and ice cubes. You can regulate the sugar content in your syrup, and then regulate how much syrup you used per drink.

In Northern Italy where I live (and I‘ve never heard of Italian Soda before!) everyone and their dog make their own elderflower syrup, and it‘s the season. The English recipes I found tend to you tons of sugar, but this one from Austria looks rather authentic https://www.lilvienna.com/homemade-elderflower-syrup/.

My go-to summer drink is chilled peppermint infusion with a dash of apple juice. Refreshing and just sweet enough for it to count. This can be prepare in bulk and stored in the fridge, as it doesn’t have fizz.

When I feel fancy I have 1/4 pure pineapple juice, 3/4 waters and a couple of ripped up fresh mint leaves. You could use sparkling water, but we just never have any. </TEXT>

Man kann das ganze natürlich auch per Hand schnitzen und wahlweise mit Mozzarella, Parmesan, Oliven, Kapern und sonstwem ergänzen. Wenn die Nudeln ausgehen können diese auch nach Belieben mit geröstetem Brot ausgetauscht werden, dann darf man es Bruschette nennen.

<TEXT> I‘m only at 14+6, but we love hiking as our cardio activity and mainly do steep hill/mountain hiking. We live in the European alps, so that works out quite well.

In a normal week, we typically do one weekday early morning walk (40min uphill speedily, then back home) and one leisurely Saturday hike (usually 5-10 miles, all uphill, with up to 3100ft change in altitude. And about once or twice a month we try to get a proper hike in.

- I always bring walking sticks. My knees are quite complainy as is, I don‘t want pregnancy/relaxin to aggravate the issue.

- I once got dizzy on a morning walk and suspect it was low blood sugar. Husband suggested bringing a sugar cube, but I got 200ml juice boxes instead. Compact, light weight and they hydrate me at the same time. I view them as an emergency supply that I only touch if needed. Doesn’t contain salts, so it only works for sugar.

- I‘ve always done all my hikes (up to 10000ft, rigged terrain and all) in approach shoes that don‘t cover the ankle. I appreciate the flexibility it gives me, especially since we love doing vie ferrate/bits of climbing in between. For the pregnancy I will definitely get shoes that go above the ankle, which are recommended for my type of hikes either way and especially in pregnancy, due to relaxin release. In fact I should get them this week.

- Carrying weight: I always used to bring a 15 gallon backpack full of crap, because I like to be prepared (cold, hungry, rain...). Now my husband gave me his tiny backpack, so I only bring my 3 liter (got tired of doing math!) camel bag, wallet, sunglasses tissues. Everything else goes in husband’s backpack and we temporarily seized his bitching rights. If I want to bring it, he carries it.

- Peeing: I pee along the the way. I‘ve always done it that way and hope regular squats will help me maintain the ability to do so throughout pregnancy. I even need to pee on some during the week walks where we‘re only out for an hour. It‘s pathetic.

- Snacks: We haven‘t started this years proper hikes yet, but on the Saturday hikes (2-4 hrs) we bring two home made protein bars each (oats, honey, protein powder, salted peanuts, coconut oil) which we usually eat at the hours mark. They have tons of salt and sugar for electrolytes and blood sugar and are just the right snack. We usually go visit friends, so there’s typically a big lunch at the end of the hike. My tummy usually grumbles 45 min before our break, but I‘ve never felt a drop in blood sugar, so I just ignore it.

- Food for longer hikes: Our pre-pregnancy go-tos were sandwiches (very dense, dark bread) with cheese, bacon and gherkins you get at every bakery here. A block of cheese, a block of bacon/speck, boiled eggs, dark chocolate. Basically anything that‘s calorically dense and can stand ~hrs in the heat.

- Heart rate: I‘ve never been one to observe my heart rate.
I have quite a low resting heart rate at about 50bpm. My dizzyness scare the other day let me reconsider it and, while I still believe in „listening to your body“ and just doing what feels right, I‘m feeling like the combination of my husband currently actively training his aerobic capacity, and me tending to push myself, could lead to me going a bit over board. So I‘ll get a lifestyle type watch to measure my heart rate. I feel like it will be reassuring to look at it sometimes and evaluate 1) yes, this is hard, but normal for you or 2) damn girl, slow down.

- Posture: I have a slight tendency for a hollow back and I think my proud mama subconscious aggravates, trying to show off my tiny bump. I really need to make a conscious effort to slightly tilt my pelvis/tense my butt and abs while walking, to make sure my back is straight.

That‘s about it from the top of my head, feel free to ask any questions that come to your mind. I‘m sorry I can‘t share any big belly hiking experience yet, but I‘ll go on a week 22 hiking holiday with my mum in August and should be able to report back. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pian piano i prodotti vegani di tipo convenience food, sostituzione di latticini e sostituzione di carne stanno arrivando anche nei supermercati italiani. Vorrei condividere una breve revisione mia di quei prodotti che ho provato ultimamente.

- Just veg! SOIA Bianco (Yogurt di soia, Aldi):
Arricchito di calcio (mi piace) e 100% soia italiano (mi piace pure) con il 20% di "preparato a base di zucchero di canna", che ammonta al totale del 13% di zuccheri. Il prezzo è imbattibile, per me con tutto sto zucchero è piuttosto und dolce che non uno yogurt che vorrei mangiare tutte le mattine. Gusto (dolce) e consinstenza a mio avviso ottimi.

- DREAM & Joya 0% sugar Soja Natur (Yogurt di soia, Eurospar):
Mi piace tanto perché ho finalmente trovato una confezione da 500g che riduce lo spreco di plastica, ed è pure senza zuccheri (ne aggiunti ne suoi). Mi piacerebbe se dentro ci fosse il calcio, ma si può procurare anche da altri fonti.

- Violife Greek white PANETTO (Formaggio tipo Feta vegano, Eurospar):
Ho aspettato tanto prima di assaggiarlo perché costa tanto ed è assolutamento privo di proteine, essendo 29% olio di cocco. Ieri l'ho finalmente provato e sono rimasta impressa! La consistenza è più burrosa e meno briccioliso del feta, ma il gusto mi piace tanto, a mio avviso è molto simile al feta, anche se decisamente meno forte. L'ho messo in insalate e su un panino e sicuramente lo riprenderò occasionalmente.

- verys CHICCA (formaggi di riso, Eurospar)
L'ho già preso due volte, mi piace che sia un prodotto italiano e per una volta senza soia (non ho problemi con la soia, ma non possiamo crescere solo quella). Il gusto mi piace, si basa fortemente  sull'infuso di origano che c'è dentro. La consistenza mi lascia perplessa perché è più dura dei formaggi freschi, ma molto più molla della mozzarella. In forno fa finta di niente. Per ora mi accontento, per un panino alla caprese va bene.

- Mein Veggie Tag The wonder Burger (hamburger vegani, Aldi)
Non mi aspettavo tanto, ma cavoli se sono buoni. Ho ultimamente assaggiato il famoso Beyond Meat burger e questi qua si avvicinano, ad un prezzo decisamente più affordabile. Cotti alla temperatura giusta sono leggermente croccanti fuori e molli (tipo "medium rare") dentro. Mangiati così con un contorno sono molto salati, la prossima volta farò degli hamburger nel panino aggiungendo lattuga, pomodori e cetrioli, così da renderli un po' meno salati.

Inoltre sia Aldi che Eurospar hanno la panna da cucina di soia, e ovviamente il latte di soia (quello della Aldi senza calcio, quello del marchio despar con calcio). C'è anche lo yogurt di soia marchio despar, sempre nel vasetto piccolo e con l'aggiunta di zucchero, ma buoni di gusto.

Ecco ora tocca a voi: Cosa avete assaggiato che si possa comprare anche qui da noi? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mann, Mama und ich hatten schon gebucht: Lazium, Apulien, Korfu und Albanische Küste. Drei Länder war mir dann wegen Corona doch zu heiß, und wegen Schwangerschaft (die kam erst nach der Buchung) im August (5. Monat) die Zielorte auch.

Daher bleibt Mann jetzt mit Katze zu Hause und zockt (sein Traumurlaub) und ich fahre mit Mama eine Woche nach Osttirol auf 1300m, zur Sommerfrische. Sollte ich wie erwartet fit sein gehen wir wandern, wenn nicht dümpel ich den ganzen Tag im See rum.

Klingt für mich diesen Sommer nach einem absoluten Traum. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ethics is a broad field and I would argue that both options can be "the ethical" one, depending on the ethical theory you're applying.

I'm by no means and expert in the field, but my understanding is that deontological ethics categories certain actions as inherently right or inherently wrong, independently of the consequences. Therefore if you categorise killing living beings as wrong, then it would be unethical, no matter why you choose to do it.

Utalitarian ethics on the other hand value "the greater good" and wnat to maximise the benefit of an action for everyone. Within utalitarianism you can then start to do the analysis of the question you're posing. At that point you'd probably need to calculate the grams of protein generated in relation to the number of animals (and maybe species?) killed.

In true philosopher's tradition (which I clearly am not!), I'll leabe it at that.

I love your question! But I don't have an answer. For now, I'll stick with pea protein. Maybe oats can be an option or peas produce in an artifical, animal-free environment.

Edit: Apparently it's "utilitarian" ethics. I'll leave the typo as a proof that I clearly have no clue what I'm talking about :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today is the day we‘re living our best lives.

There‘s this ongoing tendency of self-improvement and a search for that unknown „perfection“ in life. While I do see the critical parts of that (chasing an unrealistic ideal, rather than living the moment), I‘ve recently fallen in love with the other face of the medal.

Becoming „better“ requires you to actually define what it is you‘re thriving for: happiness, balance, meaning, lessen your carbon footprint, foster relationships... Some of these are quite abstract, others are more actionable.

Through what was less of a conscious analysis and more of an incidental process, both my husband and I have recently analysed the lives we‘re living and drafted the ones we‘d like to be living. I won‘t speak for him, but for me that includes:

- I want to inhabit a body that doesn‘t limit the choices I have in interacting with my child: I want to be able to pick them up and run up a hill together, if that‘s what we feel like doing. We have started doing „base training“ (apparently staying within a specific heart beat range for extended periods of time is good for aerobic fitness. Something something sportsy. Fact is: We quickly walk up hills several times a day)

- I want to life in an environment that makes it easy to find things that I need or want: I want our child to grow up in a clutter free environment that makes it easy to focus on important things. The other day I went out for lunch with friends and when I came back Mr. Cuppa had cleaned the whole apartment, so now we can tackle other aspects of taking care of the space we inhabit. I‘m looking forward to donating items that don‘t have space in our lives (anymore).

- I want to live surrounded by (positive and supportive) family, though they all live abroad (or we live abroad?): I want my child to have meaningful relationships with adults that are not us. I‘m taking better care of my friendships and try to understand whether I spend time with someone out of habit, or because they‘re actually good for me. And I get to go on many lunch dates in the process!

The other day, during one of our many speedy walks, speaking about the prospect of yet another delicious bowl of salad for lunch, my husband - half jokingly - said: „We‘re living our best lives“. I think it‘s a good thing, as long as you and only you are the one in charge of deciding what that is. It‘s not society‘s call to prescribe what a good life looks like. My best life involves walking up mountains, eating food that makes me feel good, dedicating time to people who‘s company I enjoy, stroking my kitty and knitting jumpers I‘ll hardly ever wear.

To me „self-improvement“ is figuring out what you want in life and acting on. Especially now that we‘re pregnant.

Have a great day everyone! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My rocket/rucola wasn‘t a real hit this year, so I decided to let it go to blossom, for bees and other critter to enjoy. It soon turned into a caterpillar farm and I‘m wondering what kind of creatures they are. Can anyone ID them?

They‘re all green and have thin yellow line all along the back https://imgur.com/a/uAqGwyK . I live in Northen Italy in a climate that‘s both Mediterranean and Alpine.

I know next to nothing about caterpillars, but they will all become butterflies/moths, right? Is there any chance they‘ll become nasty things that I‘ll regret hosting?

At the moment each caterpillar has its own rucola plant, but I‘m afraid they‘ll run out of food before they are ready to transform. Should I continue seeding sacrificial rucola to keep them well fed?

The plants are now also full with green flies/aphids and I‘m afraid to do something against them, because I don‘t want to hurt the caterpillars. I evacuate all other plants from the vicinity of the butterfly farm and I‘m hoping for some ladybugs to show up and have lunch.

So what‘s the verdict? Should I keep my new guests? And is there anything I can do to ensure their survival? It‘s a very birdy are, but despite breadcrumbs and seeds, I‘ve never seen one on our balcony, maybe also because we have a cat. I‘m grateful for any input! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before clicking the link I wasn‘t sure whether the survey was about coffee cups or menstrual cups.

Your questions also assume that all drinks purchased are take-away. Is the porcelain mug they serve my drink-in coffee in considered a reusable cup? I guess not, but it‘s also not single use.

Edit: Your question about issues and problems assumes everyone using reusable cups has encountered them. In research we‘re encourage to keep it neutral towards all options. Feel free to PM me if you want more input on questionnaire design. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You say your objective is to maximise your income, but I don‘t believe it is. If you were after that, a sensible course of action would be to scout for high earning jobs you‘re qualified for all over Europe, check out the living expenses for the respective area and just move to where you‘d end up with most money. I doubt that place would be Spain.

Your situation is different thought. You have emotional ties to Spain, you speak the language, you clearly want to live there, but I don‘t believe it‘s for financial reasons.

My take is: Just go ahead and do it. I‘m sure you‘ll manage to find a job/cost of living balance that will allow you to invest a decent chunk while having the time of your life.

Edit: I moved to a different country right after high school. 13 years later and I‘m still here. I know for a fact that my income would be larger, my expenses would be smaller and I‘d probably own a house by know, if I returned to where I came from. My quality of life would diminish though, as where I am now allows me to have a lifestyle that‘s impossible elsewhere. And awesome weather. I still manage to feed a pension account and invest a little. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Italy we get 5 months mandatory at 100% pay, which you can take starting at week 32. If you doctor and work medic allow it, you can push the start date back as much as you want, until your due date.

So the standard setup is 2 month pre and 3 months post birth. Our plan is for me to take 1 month pre, 4 months post and then add an additional 2 months at 30% pay, so that I can breastfeed full time until the baby reaches 6 months.

When you return to work before the baby turns one, each 8-hour work day comprises a 2-hour nursing break, which you can move to the beginning or end of your work day, so you effectively only work 6hrs a day until the child turns 1. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I finally managed to get in touch with my midwife about my high bile acids. She talked with the gynaecologist and they decided I'll test for it again in a month and in the meantime they'll send me to a dermatologist to check out my itchy tummy, which isn't itchy any more. Almond oil didn't help, but a regular SebaMed lotion for dry skin did the trick.

I'll still see the dermatologist, hoping they'll take a quick look at my face, where I've been having red/itchs/flaky patches for years, with a suspicion it might be rosacea (runs in the family).

Tonight I'll see my fantastic friend, mother of 3, who - when she decided 3 were enough, about 2 years ago - dropped off two huge boxes of maternity clothes at my house, without even asking :D I've been waring all of it for weeks and am so thankful that I don't have to contribute to procuding more clothes that will be worn only for a short time, seen as sustainability is quite important to me. She'll also give us her crib that grows to primary school age, and a Stokke-style high chair (ripoff). I'll definitely treat her for drinks tonight! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Binden habe ich keine, nur Slipeinlagen, und zwar von Natissy. Ich habe gesehen, dass die im Webshop auch Binden haben, im standard Material-Mix mit Bambus, Polyester und PUL, aber waschbar bei 95°C. Es gibt auf Amazon sicher günstigere Varianten, aber ich muss sagen, dass ich mit der Qualität meine Slipeinlagen (Stoffe, Nähte, Druckknopf...) total zufrieden bin. Die "organic cotton" Variante hat in der Oberschicht nur Baumwolle (statt Baumwolle und Elsathan) und als Saugschicht auch nur Baumwolle (statt Bambus und Polyester), was ich persönlich bevorzugen würde.

https://shop.natissy.eu/collections/reusable-menstrual-pads

Solltest du lieber 100% Baumwolle haben, oder Binden mit Klettverschluss statt Druckknopf bevorzugen (gut, falls du viel Fahrrad fährst oder reitest - wobei ich beim Fahrrad fahren keine Probleme mit meinem Drucknnopf habe), wirst du hier fündig: https://www.thenappylady.co.uk/reusable-cloth-sanitary-pads-csp.html

Das hier ist die Variante nur aus Baumwolle (sie warnen aber, dass an starken Tagen Bambus besser ist) https://www.thenappylady.co.uk/regular-pads/cheeky-mama-cotton-ultrapad-day.html

<TEXT> Ich benutze eine Tasse (1. Wahl war direkt die richtige Größe, jetzt habe ich eine zweite gekauft für die Zeit nach meiner aktuellen, ersten Schwangerschaft) und komm damit sehr klar. In der Zeit davor habe ich aber auch immer lieber Tampons als Binden verwendet, für mich ist das also näher dran.

Meine Schwägerin benutzt seit Jahren Stoffbinden und durch sie inspiriert habe ich mir jetzt für die (doch sehr ausflussreiche) Schwangerschaft Stoffslipeinlagen gekauft. Die sind genial! 100% Baumwolle, dementsprechend bei 90 Grad waschbar, wobei ich sie meist kalt wasche, wie meine Unterwäsche auch. Ich kann mir gut vorstellen die Einalgen später auch ab den Tagen zu tragen, bevor die Tasse zum Einsatz kommt.

Du scheinst ja zu Binden zu tendieren, das würde ich persönlich vom Lebensstil abhängig machen. Ich persönlich hätte zum Beispiel keine Lust auf der Arbeit einen Wetbag mit mehreren benutzen Binden dabei zu haben. Solltest du allerdings primär mir den Kindern unterwegs sein und dabei vielleicht auch Stoffwindeln mitführen, dann ist das natürlich eine andere Sache, die die Logistik vielleicht nicht weiter stört.

Beim Material muss man wirklich aufpassen, oft sind die Außenschichten aus 100% Baumwolle, aber der Saugkern z.B. aus Mikrofaser oder Viskose (aka Bambus). Kunstfasern haben tendenziell eine höhere Saugkraft und werden daher gerne eingesetzt, man kann sie aber meist nur bei niedrigeren Temperaturen waschen.

So, mehr habe ich nicht :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> You‘re my people! I was hoping that babies can get uses to it and somehow be desensitised for the noise level. We have doos everywhere, but at the moment all of them are always open. When closed, they block out a little more noise than a curtain would.

We‘ll definitely have the baby in a co-sleeper basinet for the beginning.

Is also dreamed up a new option tonight that involves swapping bedroom and living room, an adding a small wall to the then bedroom that basically goes from door to door, to solve the walk through issue. My husband would hate it (money and effort), but I think it would make so much sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We‘ll probably do just that and figure it out as we go. I‘m just wondering if, for example, the parent on baby watch will we fine hanging out in the bedroom/kitchen all the time, while the working parent works in the living room, or if it would make sense to create a horrible work-and-sleep combo, so that the living room can become a daytime activity/play zone.

And also if the current bedroom layout it alright, or if we should move the bed further from the centre of room to create more floor space: </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks, I will! The sofa in the living room is a sleeping sofa that our friends and family use when they visit, which is frequently. Our bed needs to be a bed bed, we couldn’t cope with folding it away every day, I‘m afraid. Checking out those resources is a good pointer though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much! It’s all very exciting. And thanks for your reply.

Your first suggestion is something I‘ve been wishing was possible ever since we moved in! Sadly, that‘s exactly where the heater in the kitchen is, so it‘s not doable (for a rental). One single door would solve all our problems.

There‘s a dresser to the left of where the bed is now, with a laptop on top, which will serve as a changing station and the baby‘s wardrobe.

The hallway is 50% gym (pull-up station) and 50% storage (cleaning supplies, outdoor gear, spares, bike stuff, cat litter).

My choice of furniture in the programme I used was quite limited, I‘ll try to add measurements and descriptions tomorrow. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your reply! That weird space is  50% gym (pull-up station) and 50% pantry. It has a big shelf unit for cleaning supplies, bike stuff, outdoor gear. The corner also holds the cat‘s litter box and our hoover. I think it‘s too narrow and dark (windowless) for an office. Great idea though, repurposing that corner hadn’t even crossed my mind.

To me walking through the bedroom with people isn’t an issue at all. I‘m more wondering if it‘ll disturb the baby (later on) when we walk through the bedroom from the living for every glass of water and toilet break.

My husband would prefer leaving things as they are now, but I believe we should at least swap the bed and wardrobe to create more central floor space for the baby to crawl and play. Or at least push the bed against a wall. Do you have any opinion on that?

And you’re totally right that we might swap things a bit later as well, I just think that if we decide to move big things like the huge wardrobe, it should happen before the baby arrives. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Apartment layout for WFH parents? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-06-14 16:09:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello everyone, I have a question that I'm sure some of you will be experts in. Our first baby is due in December and I'll return to work 6 months later. Both my husband and I work from home and we live in a tiny 43sqm/460sqft apartment.

I am now wondering which setup makes the most sense, i.e. where to put the crib/play area in relation to the desk that serves as both my and my husband's office.

Our child will start attending daycare part-time starting at 6-9 months, but there will be long stretches of the day were one parent takes care of the baby while the other parent works at home.

What are your suggestions for our situation? I created a little album that shows our current setup, as well as three different potential baby scenarios. https://imgur.com/a/PicjMju I didn't pencil in a play area, but basially the space created by moving the bed is thought to floor-space for a baby gym and play blanket.

Thank you all for your input! This is all new to us and I'm sure there are scenarios and issues we're not considering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello everyone, this isn't so much about the design and looks of things, but more about division of spaces and uses, I hope that's appropriate as well.

We live in a 43sqm/460sqft apartment with one bedroom. We also both mainly work from home, so my childhood homework desk houses two computers and serves as both of our office. We're expecting this to continue post-Covid.

Nevertheless, we will add a third human to the mix in December and I'm trying my best to figure out how to maximise the use of the little space we have. Moving is not an option for the next 3 years or so.

I created a an album with four differents layouts: Our current setup and three different baby proposals. https://imgur.com/a/PicjMju

The layouts are roughly to scale, but not exactly, as the floor plan that came with our contract only list square metres of each room, but not the lenght of each wall. I did make sure, however, that all my proposals are doable, space wise.

Some considerations:

- You need to cross the current living room in order to access the current bedroom. This is the main reason the bedroom is in the biggest room, while I would prefer the biggest room to be the living room. I don't mind crossing the bedroom with guests, but I'm unsure how practical it is to walk past the sleeping baby for every cup of water and toilet break.

- The kitchen will stay where it is. I would love for the kitchen to be where the current living room is, but that's not doable.

My question to this community now is: What would you do? Is it best to keep the bedroom strictly bedroom? Should we move the office into the bedroom (not usually a fan), so we can work late while the baby sleeps? Is there any more information I could provide, in order for you to be better able to do your magic? </TEXT>

It was awesome, because us children were clearly at the center of attention and served as perfect ice-breaking topic, plus it happened at "neutral ground" in a restaurant (that we chose!), so nobody had the stress of cooking or feeling like the other party was sniffing around in their private lifes. I liked it! Of course there were more occasion on which we all came together, buth these were a *sacred tradition.

Good on you for figuring things out! It will so pay out in the long run. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like my first name. I think it suits me, it transitioned easily into adult life and people from all over the world know how to pronounce and spell it. That's especially important for me, because I was born in country A, live in B, and my husband's from C. Naturally, my parents didn't see that coming when naming me, but it ended up coming in handy.

I never had a NN, my mum purposely chose names for my brother and I that couldn't (easily) be abbreviated. One ex boyfriend managed to turn it into a one syllable, two letter abomination, but luckily it didn't stuck. Everyone just calls me by my two syllable first name and that's fine!

I do like my maiden name, it's a noun-name and therefore has intuitive spelling in my country of origin, but it's not incredibly common. I never met someone who shares my last name and is not relative of mine. It somehow sounds strong. Some of the letter combinations don't make any sense where I live now, or they suggest very different pronunciation. That's one of the reasons we chose my husband's last name as our joint family name. I don't love the sound of our family name, but I like that it's short (one syllable) and bold. People here don't always intuitively know how to spell it, but it's only 5 letters and therefore easy enough to just spell out on the phone.

I don't have a middle name and am not missing it. Don't really see the point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Marriage is really just a contract. Quite easy to get into it, a bit more tricky and costly to get out of it.

In many cases, this contract offers protection for both parties. Sadly, most nation states still suck hard at providing a similar level if protection to people outside of this contract. This can regard children, property, health and finances. Therefore, I wouldn’t call the institution obsolete, nor risky.

What‘s interesting about divorce statistics is that they‘re heavily influenced by repeat offenders: if you get divorced once, you‘re very likely to get divorced again. So 50% of marriages ending in divorce doesn‘t mean that 50% of people who get married end up divorced. My own family is a very good example for this, with 6 divorces between my parents and my mother‘s parents alone.

I love being married, but I wish it was less strongly associated with religion, and I wish there were better ways to protect a family unit as such.

Edit: I got silvered! I'll tell my husband if we ever get divorced, the silver stays with me. </TEXT>

Personally, I never  had getting married on my radar, until I met my now husband. We got married right away (5 years ago) and are now expecting our first child. What I'm trying to say: As much as you're opposed to the idea of marriage rigth now, it's also not a betrayal of yourself or your values to one day change your mind. What's important is just to do it for the right reason: Because you really, really, really want to. If that's not the case, don't do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I'm mildly annoyed at my midwife. I last saw her on Monday, when she prescribed me a liver functions and bile acids bloods test to rule out ICP (intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy). I had told her about my itchy tummy and although my feet and palms don't itch, she wanted to get it tested just to be sure.

On Thrusday night I mailed her the results (much to my surprise, my bile acids are actually high, at 10,4 where they should be below 6), while my liver functions are normal) and haven't heard back from her since! Now, I'm not overly worried or going crazy here, but it is a little annoying that now I'll need to wait at least until Monday until I get news. Oh well.

Other than, today I'll write the final chapter of a big chunk of a project I've been working on since 2018, so that's like a whole other type of birth :)

<TEXT> Normalerweise schlagen Test am ersten Tag nach Ausbleiben der Periode an. Bei Frauen mit unregelmäßigem Zyklus weiß man aber nicht genau, wann dieser Tag wirklich ist. Manchen Frauen geht es deshalb besser, wenn sie länger warten. Andernfalls können sie trotz Schwangerschaft ein negatives Testergebnis haben, weil sie einfach zu früh getestet haben.

Wenn dein Zyklus normalerweise sehr regelmäßig ist sollte das aber kein Problem sein.

Tests mit roter Farbe kann man im positiven Fall früher eindeutig erkennen als Tests mit blauer Farbe. Sobald nur der Hauch einer zweiten Linie sichtbar ist, kann man von einem positiven Ergebnis ausgehen.

Vielleicht helfen diese Infos dir dabei zu entscheiden, wann du testen möchtest. </TEXT>

For the baby, we‘ll switch over to unscented/colour free powdered detergent, as it‘s supposed to leave less residue in fabrics than liquid does.

I wouldn’t bother if it was just clothes, but we‘re planning on cloth diapering, which makes the issue a little more pertinent, in my opinion.

I‘ll probably used „our old“ detergent for our stuff until we run out, and then just switch the whole family over to the unscented powder, unless I see it creates issues at my usual cold wash cycle. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The mechanism is interesting, as it doesn't simply squeeze/crush, but it locks in place at different intervals.

This could be to produce something that can be of variable height/thickness and/or needs some time to reach the desired thickness: Butter or cheese come to mind, both wrapped in cheese cloth. But also some meaty or fishy terrine or sausage.

The other way it could function is imagining the that the handles not only serve to squeeze the appliance, but also serve as handles for whater it is holding. You could stick it onto a hot pan handle, fix it, and move this pan holding the cool wooden handles. This would be proper crap design though, as the distance between the wood and the "thing" would create quite the lever effect.

Another option to be considered is: Just because it was found in a kitchen, it's not necessarily a kitchen appliance. Might be for handiwork of all sorts! Maybe you heat it up to hot iron military uniform shoulder marks? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think your family are entitled to live the way they want to, while you are entitled to finding it difficult to adapt.

There have already been some useful comments, like you offering (not insisting!) to cook more. You could also separate and recycle your own trash, if that’s possible.

My mum is also known for showering me in abundance and then expecting gratitude for it. I try to respond by firstly making it very clear that I appreciate the sentiment, which I do! And then I ask her as kindly as possible to not buy stuff for me, unless I ask for it. It‘s been a slow process, but it seems to be working.

If she decides to buy the least sustainable thing on earth for herself though, in my opinion that‘s entirely up to her. I might offer speaking about more sustainable alternatives, but I won‘t shove it in her face.

In short, my advice would be to be clear but kind in your communication and offer your help, for example turning brown bananas into bread and old vegetables into stock, I‘m sure you know all the tricks and twists.

Good luck and I hope you‘ll all manage to appreciate and enjoy each other’s company. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Short version**: Can you help me find this coral Max Mara jumpsuit? The helpful people over at r/femalefashionadvice have identified at the *Max Mara Vertice* Jumpsuit. Any pointers to others subreddits where I might find help are also much appreciated. As a last resort, I‘m also thankful for similar models that are still on sale. Needs to ship to Italy, or at least somewhere in Europe.

**Backstory**: Last year I went shopping with my friend, who‘s a stay-at-home mother of three. She tried this on, looked amazing in it and decided she couldn’t justify the money. To this day she won‘t shut up about and I so, so, so regret that I didn‘t go back the next day to buy it for her. It‘s her birthday soon and I would love to surprise her with it, or at least a similar model.

Thank you!

<TEXT> **Short version**: Can you help me find this [coral Max Mara jumpsuit](https://imgur.com/a/jrZkW9d) ? Any pointers to others subreddits where I might find help are also much appreciated. As a last resort, I‘m also thankful for similar models that are still on sale. Needs to ship to Italy, or at least somewhere in Europe.

**Backstory**: Last year I went shopping with my friend, who‘s a stay-at-home mother of three. She tried this on, looked amazing in it and decided she couldn’t justify the money. To this day she won‘t shut up about and I so, so, so regret that I didn‘t go back the next day to buy it for her. It‘s her birthday soon and I would love to surprise her with it, or at least a similar model.

Thank you!

EDIT: I found it on Lyst, but in L and I need an S: https://www.vestiairecollective.com/women-clothing/jumpsuits/max-mara/orange-silk-max-mara-jumpsuit-9203747.shtml?setLocale=4.en.GBP&forceNoRedirect=1&utm_source=cj&utm_medium=affiliation&utm_content=Lyst%20Ltd&utm_term=3852549-13706607&cjevent=68736086abfb11ea834000a10a18050d </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love Lucy and Anna! For Julia, I personally prefer Julie. I had two Ramonas my primary school class and thought their name was so badass! This was in Germany though, so moaning wasn't an in issue. In the meantime I met a Romana. Maybe a valid alternative? Marilyn is awesome too and in my opinion short enoguh that it doesn't actually need a nn. Lynn could work? Personally, I'm not of fan of Regina. It means Queen and I find it pretentious. Maxine is alright, but I'm not a huge fan. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hadn’t thought of an epidural before, but since frequenting pregnancy subs and reading all these amazing stories form (mainly US) women who felt like they were more alert and present thanks to an epidural, I was seriously considering one.

<TEXT> I‘m sorry to hear that. I don‘t have any coccyx pain, but I found the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tailbone-pain-coccydynia/causes/) did a good job explaining how pregnancy (and other factors) can contribute to it.

Was your C-section unplanned? They speak mainly about the effects of vaginal delivery on the muscles and ligaments surrounding the tailbone, but I suppose the first part (softening of those tissues during late pregnancy) might already have an effect on it‘s own and depending on when your C-section was performed, you still might have gone through quite a few stages of vaginal labour that may have compounded the issue.

Have you been able to find any relief yet? </TEXT>

I‘m starting to think my midwife just isn’t very good with the machines, she was barely able to get the US to work, so maybe the doppler isn‘t her forte either. I don‘t mind though, we‘ve been able to see the heartbeat with the inter US (with my gynaecologist) since week 7, so all good. </TEXT>

I just pretended it was all sunflower seed (which is wasn‘t - it was a wild mix). At 72 hrs post production it‘s undesirably soft and I‘m not sure it‘ll actually be usable.

My (fully expected) lesson: I‘ll stop buying „mixed seed oil“ as they don‘t provide percentages of the single oils used, and I‘ll collect my oils in separated, labelled containers. Next soap will be alchemistically sound. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I‘ve been using a cup for about a year now an absolutely love it. I recently sized up (and tried a new brand) for the time after my pregnancy.

On the brands we get here (Italy) the sizing guide always annoyed me: It basically says you should get S if you‘re younger than 30 (doesn‘t apply) and M if you‘ve had a child (doesn’t apply either). They never say which size 30+ women with no children should get!

Pre-pregnancy I never used panty lines, because I don‘t like the plasticky feeling. Seen as pregnancy comes with... fluids, I‘ve recently invested in a set of 100% cotton panty liners and I love them so much! I use them every day and they‘re awesome. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Retroverted (tilted, tipped) uterus </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-06-09 10:32:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I found only two posts mentioning this not-so-uncommon (10-30% of women, depending on the source) condition very briefly, so I thought I'd created one. The text below sums up the information received by my doctor, along with preliminary internet research and serves the mere purpose of giving a rough overview of the condition. This is not medical advice, but a starting point to exchange subjective experiences.

I had my nuchal scan on Friday, when the doctor nonchalantly blurted out: "Did you know you have a retroverted uterus?" No, I didn not know, I had never even heard about it! First things first: apparently nothing to worry about.

What I learned since then is that the regular position of the uterus is slightly tilded forward, basically leaning against the bladder. A retroverted uterus leans in the opposite direction, towards the rectum. This can have many reasons and is oftentime a condition the woman is born with. The Mayo Clinic calls it "a normal antomical variation", rather than a conditon.

The less tricky version is a mobile uterus, that typically flips forward on its own, once the baby is big enough and gravity does its thing. Wikipedia says this usually occurs between weeks 10-12, while I'm in week 13 and still "tipped".

There's another variety where the uterus tissues is fixes against some other internal tissue, which can require intervention. I won't get into that.

It appears that the only "issue" a retroverted uterus usually causes it that the baby is harded to see via ultrasound (because it's physically further away from the outside of the belly) and the heartbeat is harded to hear with a doppler in early stages.

Adding my personal experience: My nuchal scan at 11+4 (external US) was successful, though the doctor clearly needed some tries to get it right. My midwife found the heartbeat with a handheld doppler at 12+0, but it was only strong enough for the machine to read the number, not to actually reproduce the sound. She then used the external US (which she's not good at, seen as the gynaecologist usually does it) and had no trouble visualizing the beating heart. Purely anecdotal: From what I've read, this might expalin why I've always felt my period pain primarily in my lower back.

Any experience? Do you have a retroverted uterus as well? Have you given birth with one? I'm very isterested in everyone's experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The most important ones have already been said, but I recently accomplished the magic that is not making other people's problems my problems. If my boss in in trouble, that her beef. If she gives me an actionable task to salve, I'm happy to comply, but I'm done going sleepless at night obsessing over problems and issues that aren't mine to solve. It feels so good!

I also try to do this, to a certain extent, in my private life. I used to have a habit of trying to solve issues *for* other people: That rarely works out as intended. Son now when friends and family have a problem, I just straightforward offer them what I can contribute and let them decide for themselves whether they want to accept or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's great! I bet it wasn't and easy process.

My grandma (and quite a few other people I now) has developed quite a toxic trait under the disguise of "not caring what other people say", in a way that she's just plain inconsiderate and selfish, but brands her behaviour as self care. I'm always wary when people use that phrase, I think it's a blurry line between having a positive sense of self, and being selfish.

Personally when I struggle with "what others think", upon closer inspection I often realise that what actually brings me down is what *I think* others think. So I try to be kind to myself and let others think/speak for themselves, rather than me anticipating their perception of me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel your pain! Where I live there‘s barely any plant based food that‘s not straight up plants, that‘s why I was so excited to find a beyond dealer! I went to two supermarkets today to find plant based milk that contained both protein and calcium, but I did it.

I never buy „meat substitutes“ like tofu or seitan and I don‘t feel they’re needed for a variegated (semi-)vegetarian diet.

Today I had pasta with broccoli, mackerel and some olives for flavour, it was super good! None of it screams „high protein“, but together they do the trick.

Nutritional yeast has become my standard condiment in nearly every dish, that stuff is awesome. And I always put linseed on salad and in yoghurt/muesli.

Personally, I really didn‘t feel like fighting these cravings was worth the effort, so I just lived off pan fried potatoes and lentil lasagne for two weeks, I even ate meat twice. Whatever.

This too shall pass. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> At the beginning of my pregnancy I was very worried about what I eat and whether my baby was getting everything it needed to grow healthily.

I have absolutely no clue whether this is scientifically sound or not, but the following mindset helped me a lot: The baby is a highly adapted and successful parasite that takes everything it needs from your body. Protein, calcium, zinc, carbs...whatever. It doesn‘t take it from today‘s lunch, but straight from your body.

Therefore, what you eat is for you. Your lunch is what restores your macro- and micro-nutrients. And if you don‘t eat enough calcium in a month, your baby will take it straight from your bones, no questions asked.

What I find relieving in that idea, is that is somehow detaches today’s choices from the wellbeing of my baby, instead turning the focus on myself. I know carbs make me sleepy and protein makes me go a long way. I know that cheeseburger makes me happy for a short time, but then I can barely move for two hours.

With that in mind, I can take nutrition decisions for myself. My 1st trimester veggie aversions are gone and with the weather getting warmer I‘m really looking forward to my one big plate of salad, veggies and a protein (egg, mozzarella or fish) a day and then I can - absolutely guilt free - enjoy a good ole plate of pasta for the other.

Other than telling them off sternly there‘s nothing much you can do about commentators. Instead you can try and improve your relationship with certain foods: Occasional chocolate isn‘t poison for your baby, it‘s a perfectly normal part of a balanced diet.

Congratulations on your pregnancy and all the best for your journey, it‘s such a special and exciting one! </TEXT>

Nudel und Linsensalate gehen auch super und für die Arbeit mache ich auch gerne Wraps. Vielleicht kannst du ja mal überlegen was er sonst so auf der Arbeit isst und gerne mag (lieber Gurken oder Tomaten, lieber Sandwiches oder einzelne Komponenten?) und dafür leckere Varianten finden.

Die Idee finde ich klasse! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mais wurde mittlerweile schon genannt, aber da merke ich den Unterschied wirklich. Ebenso bei Ananas, die kann weiß und steinhart sein, oder eben gelb und süß.

Bei Kokosmilch und Kokoscreme merke ich auch starke Unterschiede, die sich aber sicher durch einen Blick auf den jeweiligen Fettgehalt erklären lassen.

Dosentomaten von den Billigmarken kaufe ich auch nicht mehr, einmal dachte ich einen halben Hühnerfuß gefunden zu haben, war dann zum Glück doch nur der Stielansatz.

Bei sauer eingelegtem muss man auch stark auf die Inhaltsstoffe achten: Gegarten Paprika in Essig, Öl und Zucker schmeckt mir persönlich zum Beispiel besser als nur in Essig. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Io ho la mentalità quasi opposta alla tua. Noi abbiamo sempre aperto la casa ad altre persone: couchsurfer, cat sitter, house sitter, coinquilini... Il caso più estremo è sicuramente stato quando ho fatto dare la nostra chiave ad una famiglia couchsurfer a noi sconosciuta che così potevano prendersi cura della nostra casa e del nostro gatto mentre eravamo all'estero. Fino ad oggi non gli ho mai incontrati, solo una volta su skype per metterci d'accordo su tutto.

Di per sé io mi fido della gente. Sto quasi aspettando il momento che qualcuno lo sfrutti, così tutti possono finalmente dire che avevano ragione.

Personalmente valuto molto le relazioni con la gente e queste, per la mia vita, hanno più valore delle poche cose che ho in casa. Se qualcuno mi ruba qualcosa, sicuramente ne ha più bisogno di me. E poi non tengo un diario scritto, quindi segreti in casa non ci sono.

Io non vedo niente di male o di strano nel tuo atteggiamento, ma personalmente preferisco vivere con le porte aperte. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Any chance you're somewhere around weeks 7-9? I'm a flexitarian and was craving meat so hard during that time! That along with carbs (especially potatoes) and cheese(burgers). I found a delivery place here that actually sells beyond meat burgers and it was heaven sent. If you're actually in that time frame my advice would be to not stress too much. For me all the spook was gone in a matter of two weeks and now at week 13 I'm back to my normal self, getting excited about salads, broccoli soup and dhaal.

As for protein, I dig into: Soy milk, soy yoghurt, oats, asparagus, broccoli, spinach, corn, peas, mushrooms, linseed/flaxseed, nutritional yeast...

None of these have tons of protein (other than linseed and nutritional yeast), but consumed alongside lentils, beans, mackerel (if you eat fish), eggs and the infamous quinoa it should help you meet your needs. Sometimes when I feel like I didn't quite make it, I supplement with pea protein powder in a smoothie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I got my blood results today!

Much to my surprise, my iron levels are perfect an I won‘t need to supplement it. I will need to learn and live with the knowledge that I was the one craving cheeseburgers and meat in general, it was not the poor iron deficient embryo.

Other than that my red blood cell count is a bit low, but that‘s fairly typical for me. Another surprise was that I actually tested negative for toxoplasmosis antibodies. I was so, so certain that I must have contracted it in my lifetime, considering my childhood lifestyle of living in gardens, forests and general dirt. Nope! Negative! So I‘ll need to continues being painstakingly careful with my gardening an washing fruit/veg.

Now to the TMI part: There was quite a bit going on in my urine, did any of you experience this as well? I don‘t have any symptoms, but there are white blood cells in my urine, all sorts of bacteria and cells from the lining of my lower urinary tract.

I‘ll have my nuchal scan on Friday and then see my gynaecologist on Monday, so I‘m sure she can shed light on everything.

Othe than that: I‘m 11+2 today and definitely starting to show! My husband and I have a competition going on to see who puts their weight on faster :) He‘s currently bulking (aiming to add 13kg) and I‘m growing a human, so far he‘s clearly winning.

Have a great day everyone! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The best language environment for a baby is certainly an environment where language is used in interaction with the baby. If you feel like switching between your L1 and L2 is your most successful strategy for interaction: go for it!

Having said that, the general advice is in fact to focus on the language that’s not a community language, so you‘re doing well in not speaking exclusively English.

In addition, code switching has long been recognized as a useful multilingual communication skill, rather than the overcome notion of „not knowing either language properly“.

OPOL works for many families, but it‘s not a law and not a one-solution-fits-all. Do what works for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Both are fine, so is a comabination as well as elimination communication in all its shades.

Personally, we are looking into cloth diapers, for a series of reasons. Once the baby is here we will see if a soft-core version of elimination communication suits us (which I believe it will), or if we want to go full nappy (which I'd be fine with too).

I'm not sure how much you've looked into it, but the main types of cloth diapers are pockets (like disposables, but you stuff them with absorbant layers and wash everything ofter use), all-in-ones (like disposables, witth absorbant layers already attached to the diaper), fitteds (like disposable, but all absorbant material, so you wear a cover or a soaker on top, which can be re-used before washing) and flats (these are old school muslin squares that you fold, wrap around the baby and use a cover/soaker on top).

Now, I'm getting into this much detail, because we're planning on going the seemingly most scary/least popular route of using the flats, for several reasons:

- Space: Our apartment is really small and a typical "stash" of pockets/all in ones/fitteds can take up tons of space. We will only need very few covers/soakers to go with and more flats/prefolds/pads for added absorbancy.

- Washing volume: Our washing machine takes only 4kg and we can't wash a night, so washing a load of fast-drying flats seems way for managable that washing the same amount of pockets/all in ones/fitteds.

- True one size fits all: The same flat diaper can be folded in different ways to fit a newborn, a toddler and all the stages in-between.

- Ecological: Every parent has used cotton squares at home and we're just collecting them fro friends and family, no need to contribute to the further production of diapers.

This isn't an exhaustive list, but alltogether it just seems to be the best solution in our specific case.

Having said that, we're definitely going to get a packet of newborn size disposables for the inevitable occasion when my sllep-deprived husband (or I!) will tie knots into his fingers with a screaming baby at 3 am and all we want is get back to bed.

Same with daycare: Our current plan is to get some fitteds or even all in ones for them to use if flats are too involved, but we won't write letters of protest if they refuse to, we'll just get disposables for them.

Some people tell grandparents/godparents and other secondary caretakers "You can use disposables if you're happy to buy them". We won't do that. If someones is willing to take care of our child, but intimidated by cloth diapering, we will absolutely supply them with disposables.

Sorry for the wall of text, I just love having the opportunity to write about a topic I'm interested, in a space where I don't feel like people will judge me for having either too much or too little muesli and in my life :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yesterday I had work meeting that I estimated would last about 1,5hrs. I did the usual routine: pee, get a cup of ginger infusion and a bottle of water. This team is always quite chatty and deviated a bit from the core topic and throughout the hours I felt my bladder filling up. Not drinking is never an option for me, so I just pushed through it.

After 2,5hrs we reached a turning point between one topic and another and I just knew the next one would take forever as well. So I excuses myself for a second and rushed to our only bathroom - just to find my husband mid-poop. There was no chance in hell I could wait him out, even if I wanted to awkwardly return to the meeting and excuse myself again 2 min later.

So I did what any sane pregnant person would do: I peed in the bidet. Not my proudest moment, but it just had to happen there and then.

Let me guess: It‘s only going to get worse, right? </TEXT>

There‘s an [article about it](https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2018/03/02/Study-that-alleges-many-protein-powders-contain-heavy-metals-gets-big-pushback-including-threatened-legal-action), a [white paper](https://cleanlabelproject.org/protein-powder-white-paper/) and the corresponding [infographic](https://cleanlabelproject.org/wp-content/uploads/Protein-Powder_Infographic-0111.jpg).

Now, like the article says, traceable amounts aren‘t necessarily unsafe amounts. Personally I‘m taking pea protein, which by the looks of it is even worse.

Edit: overall whey scores much better than plant based powders. This 2015 study contains [a chart](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/04/protein-drinks/index.htm?userWantsFull=true). Your product isn‘t on it, but this way you can see what ballpark of contamination we‘re looking at and maybe compare it to max safe amounts for pregnancy, which must be somewhere out there. </TEXT>

Auf der Webseite findet man jetzt aber nur noch eine einzige Langarmbluse aus dem Material (allerdings gemischt), alle anderen sind aus Viskose (Lenzing/Ecovero) oder Baumwolle.

<TEXT> From my experience children often respond best to treating both languages as a mothertongue, seen as that‘s probably what you would like to see as a result. In my opinion languages  and communication should be fun, not forced.

The best thing your husband can do is getting back to using OPOL more strictly and maybe get some additional fun time with the children when he has time, to do fun stuff with them in Spanish.

Language sticks best to children‘s brains (and becomes operable) when the use of the language and the context it‘s used in makes sense to them. Watching a TV show in Spanish because mom said so? Doesn‘t make sense. Speaking Spanish with dad on a cycling tour? Makes sense, because we speak English with dad.

I know you want the absolute best for your children and love them to bits, but if I were in you I‘d try to take some of the pressure out of it.

Good luck! </TEXT>

Im schlimmsten Fall hätten 100ml Produkt mit 0,4% Algengehalt also 4400 Mikrogramm Jod, bei einer empfohlenen täglichen Verzehrmenge 200 Mikrogramm.

Das ist allerdings das absolute worst case Szenario und als Naturprodukt wird das wahrscheinlich starken Schwankungen unterliegen.

Kurzfassung: Keine Ahnung.

<TEXT> In my experience nicknames are out of parental control either way. In highschool everyone just gave each other nicknames, oftentimes ones that had nothing to do with either first or last name. I was always a bit sad I never got my „cool“ nickname. You couldn’t just pick one for yourself, that‘s not how it works.

Non of them were particularly nice either, they were name like Kvinn for Kevin or Boat for someone with the last name Botson. Some more normal ones, like Jones for John. Others actually had a family connection, as in they were the variations the people used themselves as toddlers, when they weren’t able to pronounce their names properly. Those were probably my favourites.

I‘m not a huge fan of top 10 names myself, but „losing“ control over what their nickname is really isn’t an issue to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Frühstück**: Klassisches italienisches Frühstück in der Bar: Cappuccino und Schokocroissant. Das hatten wir lange nicht mehr!

**Mittagessen**: Spaghetti al pesto di arachidi e basilico, wie wir das gestern politisch korrekt getauft haben.

**Abendessen**: Nachdem ich mir seit 3 Tagen Notfallmenüs aus den Fingern zaubere hat Mr. C mich gestern an das volle Eisfach erinnert. Mal sehen was er sich aussucht.

Edit: Am Ende habe doch ich entschieden, es gibt Kartoffel-Lauch-Suppe, weil die herrlich zum frischen Sauerteigbrot passt und ich da noch die angebrochene Kochsahne von gestern reinschmuggeln kann.

Außerdem habe ich es heute wieder mit Kaltgetränken als Snack: Ananassaft (diesmal echter, nicht der Dosensirup) mit Wasser, Eis und Minze aus dem Garten. Herrlich! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I went to get my blood drawn for the different tests (7 vials!). I find 10+0 a little late for that, I‘d be shocked to learn something was wrong with my iron, for example. Should that be case, I really would have wanted tot know earlier. But then again, they probably would have tested it earlier, had I shown any symptoms.

I had it done at the hospital and got so excited when I got to press the „pregnant“ button to get my preferential treatment number, rather than queuing with the general public :)

They also tool a urine sample which I wonder if they can actually use it, seen as it was 90% urine and 10% vaginal progesterone (i.e. peanut oil), by the looks of it.

On Monday I can go pick up the results (it‘s a bit backwards here, I would have had to ask for online results when I registered, but I realised that to late) and then the Friday after I‘ll have my nuchal scan. Exciting times!

Here in Italy all these tests are free, there‘s just one that I opted to have and will need to pay for. Can‘t remember if it was iron? That one costs 22€/24$. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The one big expense is my husband‘s university which is about 25.000$ total. We he first started we said the common account pays for it and he‘ll pay it back when he can. Now that we know we‘re in it for the long run he still keeps track of the sum, but I see it as an investment in the family and I don‘t think we‘ll let him pay it back, especially seen as now he only gets pocket money.

As for pre-relationship debt: He had a small private debt with his dad, which his dad erased as a wedding gift to him.

So I‘m afraid I can‘t really answer that.

I would consider adding up all the joint expenses you have (including daycare, car loan, student debt, rent, gym membership) and figure out which percentage of your joint income that requires. In our case it was 2/3 (by which I mean 66% of each partners income, not sure that was clear). Should you figure out that by doing so everything is covered and everyone still has ok leftovers for personal expenses (clothing, dining out with friends) it might be something that works for everyone involved.

In a relationship I think it‘s more about finding a solution that works, not so much one that‘s fair.

Friends of mine live off her income and save his. That, for example, is a solution that wouldn’t work for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with everyone saying you‘re a family and the child expenses are joint expenses.

However, that doesn‘t mean 50/50 is the best option for you. My husband and I have quite an income disparity as well and when we started splitting costs, I just hated the idea of him not being able to have coffee with his friends because he couldn’t afford it.

So what we did is everyone sent 2/3 of their income to the common account and we paid everything from there. The other 1/3 remained personal money. To me, that was the best solution. He still had some money left to himself, but I didn‘t need to pamper him and invite him for dinner, because it just became joint money.

So I agree: You should pay more, but not because of the child.

Our arrangement now that we‘re expecting our first child (which will come with sustained loss of income due to child care) is that all income goes to the common account and we both get the same amount of monthly money for our retirement accounts, savings and personal spending. That‘s the best solution for us now.

If I were in you I‘d figure out a percentage of both your incomes that would cover your costs (that might differ from our 2/3) and open a joint account. </TEXT>

Once my stash is completed I will strip them all, but I was just wondering if this is a recurring issue. The diapers have been used locally and according to our water supplier the water is medium, not hard. We do get quite a bit of mineral buildup in the sink/kettle though, so I‘m not fully convinced.

<TEXT> That sounds like me. I'm also int the December group and at 9w5d. What you're describing is far from "hardly any symptoms" though, it's a perfectly normal first trimester without vomiting!

I've never had an inch of nausea or constipation. I did have moments of low blood pressure, incredible tiredness, mild food aversion and really, really wanting potatoes.

There's no reason to worry because a.) you do have tons of symptoms and b.) even a first trimester without any symptoms at all isn't a predictor for doom.

Having said said: I totally get it! I'll never forget the day I read in "Expecting better" how "nausea is a good sign of a healthy pregnancy". Yes, I did freak out too. I've had 3 ultrasounds so far (SCH) and everything is perfect! Also: The little symptoms I did have, have now completely vanished. Maybe apart from my obsession with carbs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To me Ero is just the imperfetto of essere, I‘d rather go with Eros, which at least everyone knows from Ramazzotti. In Italy, people tend to just use the first part of your name as a nickname (Francesco->Fra), so apart from the nickname you decide one, people might tend to use Ante, Anti, Andy.

If you love it, go with it. If you want to compromise, use it as a nickname. If you can‘t get on board with it, veto your husband. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before we got married, my husband told me: „Whatever you dislike about me won‘t change, if anything, it‘ll get worse. Are you sure you want to do this?“ He‘s so romantic.

Your doing the right thing reconsidering your needs and priorities before taking this step. The final decision will depend on you, what‘s ok for others might be a dealbreaker for you. I see a fee parallels between your partner and my husband.

I work full time in a competitive field and he‘s part time self employed and a student. That means he makes way less money, but he works nearly as much as I do. Whenever he has slower periods, I expect him to pick up more slack at home, doing chores. A huge plus for me (currently pregnant with our first) is that I know as the main breadwinner, childcare responsibilities won’t automatically fall back on me, as is often the case. Sure, I‘d love him to make as much money as I do, so I could take a year or two off. On the other hand, knowing our child will grow up with two primary caretakers rather than a stay at home mum and an absentee father is a huge plus.

This relates to the feminism thing: My husband firmly believe that I can do anything he can do, that I‘m strong as hell and that I generell don‘t need help. Sadly, he doesn’t draw a line. He wouldn‘t hold the door open for me or carry the heavier bag „just because“. Interestingly, this is more of and issue for my mum than it is foe me, guess she‘d like to see a „gentleman“ in him. What counts for me is that he does step up when I ask him to, which he does.

Now to the sex: same situation here. I‘d quite happily have sex every day. He has a way lower libido, combined with being notoriously run down/exhausted at night. To make things worse he also has some sensory preferences that basically mean that we never french kiss/make out outside of having sex. Frequency of sex varies, it’s less than once a week. I would love to have post-work afternoon sex snd making out on the sofa. It‘s not going to happen, so we cuddle and hug a lot and I have solo-sex whenever I feel like it. Works for us.

Do what‘s right for you. Finding the balance is difficult, between discarding a great partner for a minor flaw and settling with the wrong person out of fear to be alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I read the title I assumed the interaction went the other way around!

As others have already said, from a European perspective it‘s really hard to imagine how much societal pressure there is in favour of circumcision. Over here foreskin care and teaching boys proper cleaning routines is just a regular part of parenting a boy, nobody bats an eye at it and nobody thinks it‘s icky.

My brother was circumcised as an infant because his foreskin was too tight and couldn‘t fully retract. In Germany, he‘s the exotic one :)

The bannig discourse is very difficult, seem as it‘s so deeply culturally ingrained in the US and other countries, taking away a professional, safe and sterile option can lead families to opt for unsafe backyard/out-of-the-country procedures. But maybe that‘s a necessary passing phase on the way to getting rid of the practice. </TEXT>

I don‘t think it‘s very popular here, I just stumbled upon the reimbursement scheme when looking for other financial incentives for parents. There‘s no cloth washing service in my region and there are newspaper articles on a clothe diaper library from 2017, but nothing since then. Also, nobody in my region sells used cloth diapers, I checked all possible platforms (aside from facebook, admittedly). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much! That was tremendously helpful. To add onto that, I read quite often that fitteds are recommended for nights. Do you share that opinion, or are flats just fine for nights as well, maybe with a fleece dry layer?

Regarding the old/new, I generally try to buy as little new stuff as possible, so I was actually considering not making use of the reimbursement at all, unless there’s a good reason to buy something new. Luckily it‘s applicable during the first 3 years after birth, so maybe once the baby is here we‘ll have a better idea of what we need new. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much! This was very helpful.

I‘m having real trouble second hand buying diapers here in Italy, as people are frustratingly unspecific in their description (oftentimes just state the brand, but the brand carries all systems) and a big confusion in terminology, as everyone seems to use „prefold“ for both prefolds and flats (probably because they need to be „prefolded“). It‘s so tricky and time consuming! Luckily I still have 7 months to get our stash together :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> My first baby is due in forever, but I‘m starting to have a look around for used diapers to start my stash.

Our washing machine is tiny, so people here recommended we use flats. These are the questions I currently have:

- Can I use the cover of an AI2 as a cover for a prefold/flat, or do they necessarily need to be used with their own insert?

- My idea is to get some flats and prefolds plus some covers and soakers, which we will then be able to use in whichever combo we end up preferring, is that correct?

- I‘m not sure how cloth friendly our daycare will be, but I guess for them I‘ll get some AI2s or fitted?

- My local government reimburses 50% of the costs of buying cloth diapers, up to max. payout of 130$. Out of the products I‘m planning on getting, which ones would you recommend buying new?

Thanks for your input! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I did some shopping.

I try to be mindful about what I buy and where and I'm a huge fan of second hand items. I've seen the term "preloved", but I'm comfortable not using a euphemism for it :)

When it come to pregnancy clothing I'm really fortunate and basically covered, because three of my friends gave me all their things. What I bought so far is 5 nursing bras (2 new, 3 used, all Medela) and, as of today, 8 nursing camis. All my friends said they loved them for nursing and seen as I'm a middle aged man (as my husband puts it), I always wear a cami under my jumpers, tucked into my trousers. So I guess they will come in handy in winter, when I can just push up my jumper and flap down the cami.

I'm now trying to figure out whether it's worth investing my time in finding a good deal for a Stokke tripp trapp (growing chair), or if I should just get on of the baby chairs you attach directly to the table. My friends' recommendations are mixed on this one and our apartment is really tiny. We'll figure it out.

In that vein: I really love all the best/worst purchase threads that keep creeping up in every pregnancy related subreddit, they're so useful! Half the recommended stuff isn't available in Europe, but it gives you a vague idea.

What's everyone else up to? </TEXT>

Kleingeschnittenen Spargel mit in die Pfanne, angebraten, dann mit Nudelkochwasser abgelöscht und weiter gedünstet. Zwei Minuten bevor die Spaghetti fertig waren, alle mit in Pfanne, noch ne Kelle Nudelwasser drauf. Hälfte vom Käse dazu, viel rühren (oder eher einmassieren), damit sich Käse und Wasser verbinden. Rest vom Käse drüber, noch ne Kelle Nudelwasser. Ich hab an dem Punkt erst an den Pfeffer gedacht, der kommt ja normal zuerst in die Pfanne, aber puristisch wurde es heute von Anfang an nicht. Als alles schön cremig war hab ich noch ne Handvoll Basilikum untergezupft, aber das auch eher weil ich so stolz auf meine Ernte bin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **Frühstück**: Brot mit Nuss-Nougat-Creme und Banane. Gibt so Tage :)

**Mittagessen**: Spaghetti mit grünem Spargel und Basilikum, inspiriert an Cacio e pepe (statt Pecorino mit Grana). Vorzüglich! Käsig, cremig und mit Alibi-Gemüse.

**Abendessen**: Vermutlich Lasagne mit Linsenragù, sollte doch mal wieder die Arbeit dazwischen kommen, dann essen wir vegetarische Burger (mit Quinoa und Aubergine, bin gespannt) auf Brotresten evtl. Brokkoli.

*Tipp*: So ein falsches Cacio e pepe kann man sicher auch mit mildem Provolone zaubern.

**Update**: Zum Abendessen gibt es Ofenkartoffeln (baked potatoes) mit einer sauguten Sour Cream. Kein Alibigemüse! Und sollte das nicht reichen, dann machen wir noch ne Dose Fisch auf. Ich bin so glücklich und so hungrig, aber zum Glück fehlen nur noch 14 Grad :) </TEXT>

Our kitchen is also the dining room, our living room is also a double office and guest room and our bedroom will also be the nursery/changing room/play room and all that on 50 square meters/500 square foot. We‘ll be fine!

And all the excess money we save by paying basically nothing in rent (seriously! It’s 500€/550$) will go towards a down payment in 5-6 years, so when our child starts caring about it they can have a bigger room and a garden in a house that right now we wouldn’t be able to afford.

We can still paint a layered mountain mural in our bedroom/nursery to keep up with the Johnson‘s in the meantime :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> My cravings care packet arrived today! Yes, I have ordered 3kg of salty (saliam) licorice from Germany. Sadly, I shouldn't eat too much of it (according to Finnish researchers, and they know what they're talking about, when it comes to salmiakki), but after the initial binge I'll be happy to just have it around. I love salty licorice.

Other than that, today was one of these dreaded days I just had to cycle into town, so I made the most of it: Picked up the book for work that cause me to go there in there first place, met a friend for coffee (first time seeing her alone since...

<TEXT> The first craving I had was for pickled herring. Apparently they’re a creature of the North and just don‘t exist southside. My husband went to 4 different stores and bought the closest things he could find. Now we have a stash of canned salmon and mackerel that I don‘t even want to touch. On the plus side, the craving is gone.

Interestingly, my baby appears to be more German than I am: All I have craved so far was pickled herring, meat, potatoes, a specific kind of northern German cured salami, and salty (salmiak) liquorice. Luckily we do have potatoes in Italy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I met the downstairs neighbours' 3-week-old granddaughter for the first time! She is so, so cute. We haven't told the neighbours about my pregnancy yet and I would like to do it together with my husband, but it was so hard not to burst out with: "In 7 months she'll have a playmate when she comes to see grandma!" :D

The darker and better hidden side of my soul was mildly envious at the baby's mum (neighbours's daughter) for looking impeccable 3 weeks postpartum! I mean, she's always been in perfect shape and well kept, she clearly takes very good care of her appearance. I'm usually completely fine with my body and the way I look, but today it stung a little that 9 weeks into my pregnancy I already have more of a tummy than she does 3 weeks after hers.

But that was really just a faint naggy voice and the 3 too many slices of pizza I had for dinner are a clear indicator that I can't care too much :)

Last news about the neighbour baby: She breastfeeds every 3-4 hrs and wakes up once during the night. It's not easy, but I'm trying very, very hard not to make that my expectation of motherhood. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I was stronger than my cravings.

I had to go into town (which I hate, in corona times) to pick up my new sunglasses (very exciting, my first ever corrective sunglasses!). My husband usually does the shopping, to limit my expose, but seen as I had to go either way, I agreed to take over the chore. I did warn him that our bank account will suffer it, seen as I am currently unable/unwilling to exert self-control and the baby really wants junk food.

My first win of the day was that the post office was actually open, to I managed to ship off my mum's belated mother's day gift, and the ovluation tests I never got to use are on their way to my TTC cousin.

To brace myself for the supermarket I went to have lunch at a kebap stall and can proudly report that I took the vegetarian option and it was awesome! I've been avoiding meat for about 9 months before I got pregnant, but the baby really makes me crave meat. Today I won.

For the past 10 days I had my heart sat on making the infamous reddit "upvote soup", aka creamy chicken spinach ravioli. I had it all on the list, but when I entered the supermarket I just realised: I don't want to buy chicken! So I bought equally amazing food that will be able to satisfy another set of my cravings: Carbs!

I'm hoping a heavy base of carbs will allow me to sneak some vegetables (which I usually love!) into my pregant body. So far I have made tomato/mozzarella/basil wraps and they were awesome! Tonight we'll have spaghetti with zucchini creme, which I'll probably pimp with some cream cheese for enhanced creaminess. Tomorrow I'll fill some puff pastry with whatever nommy things I find (broccoli, onion and cheese?) and at night we can make our own pizza dough for a margherita.

My lesson of the day: It's ok to have cravings, it's ok to give in to  them, it feels great to find happy compromises, whatever that might mean to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In Italy we get 5 months obligatory maternity leave at 100% pay. Neither the employer nor the employee can reject it. The standard allocation is 2 months pre- and 3 months post-partum, but as long as both your doctor and the work medic agree, you can start it variably anytime between 2 month prepartum and the day of delivery. Whatever is left on the delivery day you then take postpartum.

EDIT: I read your post wrong and fully agree. Had I not been in homeoffice, there's no way I would have been able to keep up the "working fulltime" during the 1st trimester sharades. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Him learning a second language will not hinder his ability to communicate with you. He might learn a new word in Icelandic that he doesn’t know yet in English and use that word at home. That can feel tough to parents, but the child soon learns to differentiate between the two languages and when to use which one.

It’s very likely that your child won’t be their first non-Icelandic child. Share your concerns with them, but they are professionals and if they can figure out the needs of a nonverbal baby, they sure find a way to install communication with an Australian toddler.

If this were a bilingual (English and Icelandic) childcare, they would make sure your child’s first primary caretaker is English speaking. Seen as it’s monolingual and he needs to learn Icelandic to be part of the group, I guess their approach will focus on picking up the language straight away.

He’ll be fine, you’ll be fine.

Edit to add: The best thing you can do to prepare him now is strengthen him in his mothertongue as much as you can. Whatever activity you do with him, speak with him about it, decontextualise (when reading a book point at the tree and speak with him about trees that are meaningful to him, like the one in your parent’s driveway or the tree you pass on the way to your supermarket). Language exchanges that are meaningful to him (rather than: where’s the bear? Where’s the cat) are very helpful in acquiring a solid foundation in his first language that might help with acquiring a new language. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My husband has been diagnosed in hi late 20‘s. His mum had tried to have him get checked out in childhood, but the doctors just brushed it off as effects of parental absenteeism and made her feel horrible.

He‘s doing quite well with 10mg Ritalin per day, which he usually doesn’t take on weekends and low stress days.

The way he describes it is that the struggles are still there and the strategies to apply in order to help him are still a challenge, but it becomes more manageable.

After some years of medication he now manages to juggle part-time studies, part-time work, his share of the household and to top it off is confident enough to start a family with me.

I was wary in the beginning, when he started speaking about medication, but it‘s definitely the right path for him.

I hope you‘ll find a solution that works for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I‘ll be 33 when our first is born. I‘d love to have a second child closely after, but my husband is heavily leaning towards OAD. I was hoping for twins with the first, as a compromise.

We don‘t have any family in the country we live in, so they won‘t get to grow up surrounded by cousins and aunts like I did. I have a brother who‘s less than 2 years older than me and I love it! My husband is in nearly daily contact with one of his two siblings, but he - correctly - keeps saying that our experience won‘t necessarily be the child(ren)‘s experience.

As far as I understood he‘s afraid of not being able to cope (mentally) with taking care of two, the stress that comes with it and the financial burden.

I have much more of a „we‘ll make it work“ attitude than him. </TEXT>

As it is with my pregnancy, 2 hrs after lunch I was hungry again. I got up from my work laptop, opened the window for some oxygen and made myself a banana milkshake. I've been trying to mindful about the long periods of time I force my eyes to stare a screen, so I decided to put on a coat (a low above Europe: cold and rainy) and enjoy my short break on the balcony.

Now I don't know whether it was the time spent on the balcony, the cooled down room, the cold shake I drank or all of the above. Fact is: My nipples are frozen stiff and hurt so, so much! This too shall pass. </TEXT>

The baby measured 8+1 (17mm), therefore the suspected due date of 21.12. is confirmed. It actually lines up with the first measurements I had at 6+2, so that's a relief. I'm really excited about it! It was good to see the heartbeat again and the hematoma seems to have disappeared as well.

<TEXT> If he has 3 options on his plate (e.g. a protein, a carb, a vegetable) it‘s very unlikely he doesn‘t like any of them. Is he allowed to touch his food and play with it? Many children prefer getting to know their food with other senses, before they‘re confident putting it in their mouth. Ideally, the focus should be on the child enjoying the food and enjoying eating, not on how much he eats. Mealtime should be as carefree and free of stress as possible.

Having said that: It‘s hard. Some kids really are picky and toddlers can be odd in general. I hope you find a way that works for you! </TEXT>

Bei Inbetriebnahme kam ein bestialischer Gestank aus der Karre, der sich auch für die nächsten drei Wochen nicht verabschiedet hat. Erst dachten wir es sei Milch ausgelaufen, bis wir zwischen den Ritzen die geschmolzenen Überreste eine Harzer Rolle gefunden haben. Ich rieche das heute noch.

<TEXT> I feel your pain. We have that multilanguage family constellation going on as well. I think Emma is perfect for a girl: I love the sound, it has intuitive spelling and is pronounced exactly the same in all three of our languages. Plus: the best kid I know is called Emma, in a different country.

It‘s juts really way too popular.

I keep seeing how popular names now are nowhere near a widespread as they used to be. Think of it as 10% of baby boys used to share the top 1 name, now it‘s down to 2%. The figures are completely made up, just to get the point across.

Yet I still think there is such a thing as *too* popular. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, here's my contribution on the situation in Italy. It varies a bit depending one the region you live in, but many regualtions are national.

- **Health insurance**: Everyone has governmental health insurance. Antenatal care is free of cost through the public system. You can choose to go through the private system and pay for it. Some recommended tests are not included (such as iron bloos levels), but very affordable. Antenatal care includes at least 3 ultrasounds throughout pregnancy plus the nuchal scan, if you wish to have it.

- **Pregnant workers**: Unlike what OP described, in Italy pregnant women are not allowed to do night shifts, not even voluntarily. Over-night presence (night shift where you get to sleep) is also forbidden, as well as working overtime. If pregnancy impedes you from carrying out your regualr job (such as working with chemicals) your employer has to find alternative low-risk tasks for you, or however continue paying your wage. Pregnancy related doctor visits during the work time are fully compensated.

- **Maternity leave**: Compulsory maternity leave is 5 months, this also goes for fostering and adopting children and can be taken by a non-birthing parent if the mother is out of the picture for any reason. They are typically taken 2 months before and 3 months after delivery, but if both your doctor and your work medic ok it, you can take it flexibly and work up until the due date. Maternity leave is fully compensated.

- **Paternity leave**: Fathers get 7 fully compensated days off. That should be more!

- **Optional parental leave**: Between the child's birth and them turning 8 years of age, the parents can jointly take up to 10 months off from work, for 30% of their medium salary. If the father takes at least 3 months off, another month is added to the total time.

- **Baby bonus**: Italy has one of the lowest birth rates in Europe (if not the lowest?) so the govrnemnt gives you 800€ to each birth/adoption.

- **Daycare cost**: Regular daycare cost is split to 1/3 each to be paid by the parents, the municipality and the local government. In addition, each family receives about 200€ a month to either pay for daycare or compensate the stay at home parent for their childcare work. Children that effectively go to daycare get another 130€/month they attend.

- **Breastfeeding breaks**: Every day the new mum works, until the child turns one, she is entitled to two breaks of one hour each. They can be taken jointly (two hrs in a row) and also at the beginning or end of the work day. They are fully compensated and do not need to be used for breastfeeding/pumping. Mothers who bottle feed are also entitled to it.

- **Family cheques**: There's a wild assortment of financial aid on a national and local level, some for the first 3 years, some go longer. It's too complex to spell it all out. I once calculated that, including the above mentioned baby bonus, you receive about 400€/month in the first year, 250€/month in the second and third year and 50€/month after that, until the child turns 7.

I'm sure I forgot some things, but considering what bad rep Italy often gets in Eruope, our constitution is lit and our health and family care is really not that bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I was proper, proper hangry.

We both have tons to do at the minute (my work and his uni), so today is a no-cook day. Dinner is settled, we're thawing meal-prepped curry. For lunch, I was really craving chinese, despite non of the restaurant offering anything with the hoisin sauce I've been dreaming of.

We finally settled on what to order and I pre-ordered for lunch time. All good! But then the unimaginable happened: 15 minutes before my selected delivery time they just flat out cancelled the order. You can do that to people, let alone to a pregnant woman!

I went into panic mode and found emergency pizza that could be with us in a matter of 30 min. I can do this, I thought. A couple of minutes before it arrived I got increasingly hungy and nervous. I got up to prepare everything for the arrival of the pizzas, I knew things would have to move quickly. I prepped the sofa (that kind of a day), picked some fresh basil to pimp the pizzas and got my scissors ready. Mayn people (especially here in Italy!) consider it a affront to cut pizza with scissors, but to me it really the best way, you should try it!

While impatiently lurking around on the balcony, the pizza man finally came. I stormed back upstairs, into the living room and realized in agony: The scissors! Where are they? Frantically searching the living room, kitchen balcony, smell of nommy pizza in my nose, I just couldn't find them. Mr. Cuppa's reaction: "I don't know either."

And that's when I got really, really, hangry. I finally found them in the kitchen drawer, where they live. Mr. Cuppa suggested I should always have an emergency sugar cube at hand. The pizza was so, so good. </TEXT>

Our payments to the fund are tax deductible and if the child wants they can access it early to buy a house. Once they start earning their own money, they can decide to continue the payments, or not.

Whichever product you‘ll end up choosing, make sure it‘s in your child‘s name and in their name only, so it cannot be accessed by the authorities in case you find yourself in financial hardship. </TEXT>

Deine Argumentation mit der Futterwahl ist schlüssig und weit verbreitet. Das ist ein klarer Konflikt mit dem ich bewusst lebe. Ich finde es wichtig dem Autonomiebestreben des Tieres weniger im Weg zu stehen, als das in meiner Lebenssituation bei einem Hund der Fall wäre. Und ja, andere Tiere sterben, damit meines am Leben bleiben kann.

Ich kann mit den Widersprüchen und Konflikten in meinen Entscheidungen ganz gut leben. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ich persönlich bin mit Haustieren einverstanden. Am wenigsten ethische Zweifel habe ich bei second hand Freilaufkatzen, da diese wirklich machen können wonach ihnen der Kopf steht.

Vor allem in den USA gibt es immer lautere Stimmen, die Freilaufhaltung von Katzen zu verbieten, um die Vogelbestände zu schützen. Unsere aktuelle Katze (auch eine Gebrauchtkatze) hat es in den 6 Jahren mit uns geschafft eine Maus zu fangen, damit kann ich leben.

Mir ist wichtig, dass meine Haustiere sich nicht vermehren und, so süß die Kleinen auch sind, ich versuche mein Bestes deren Vermehrung auch sonstwie nicht zu unterstützen, z.B. durch Welpenadoption.

Für viele Veganer/innen besteht dann auch noch die Frage der Futtermittelbeschaffung. Hierbei muss ich ganz klar sagen, dass ich persönlich alle ethischen Bedenken über Bord werfe und das Futtermittel kaufe, dass meiner Katze am besten bekommt. Ich kann aber auch jede/n verstehen, die/der besonders auf die Umstände der Herstellung des Futtermittels achtet. Weniger Verständnis habe ich für die vegane Ernährung omnivorer Haustiere, positioniere mich da aber nicht eindeutig, weil ich einfach viel zu wenig Wissen in dem Bereich habe.

Schlimm finde ich z.B. das Verhalten einer Verwandten, die einen Welpen aus Hauszuüchtung adoptiert hat. Bei einem gemeinsamen Spaziergang mit einem zufällig unkastrierten Rüden ihrer zufälligen Lieblingshunderasse sind die zwei dann aus versehen abgehauen. Sprich: Sie hat ihre Hündin absichtlich paaren lassen und verkauft die Hunde jetzt, jammert dabei auch noch, dass sie ja zumindest die Tieraztkosten reinbekommen muss. Dafür fehlt mir jegliches Verständnis. </TEXT>

After my first communion I continued praying. I never knew what to tell God, because I had already discussed everything important with my family and friends, so I just read the prayers from my wooden prayer die.

We stayed over at my dad's place and I spent the whole next day alternating between puking and trying to sleep. My husband eventually got up and had lunch with my dad, I think. It was all a blur. At some point my brother came to pick us up, I hugged my dad goodbye and we left, at about 4pm.

That ended up having been the last time I got to see my dad, he died two days later. So the one thing I would like to change is get less drunk that very night and spend the day with my dad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **There's nothing wrong with you choosing to abort. There is something wrong with you aborting because you feel like you don't have a choice.**

I'm a social worker too. As a social worker, you know that in many situations there's no right or wrong, situations matter, the decision is up to you and ethics is a bitch.

The final step my husband and I took before TTC was to go through questions like this together. I was firmly against testing, because I did not want to find myself in the position of having to take that decision. He was firmly pro testing, because, in his words, "knowing is always better".

When asked what he would do with the results, he said "We'll take it from there." I don't even know how much they can tell with these tests, for example if they can quantify the severity of a chromosomal abnormality, or just tell you whether it's there or not.

In our case, we came to the agreement that a non-life threatening chromosomal abnormality with the potential of acquiring speech (or sign language) would not be an automatic reason for abortion for us.

For all the other scenarios, we don't have answer yet and we selfishly hope we'll never nee to find one.

Now back to you: Have you had the chance to speak to your boyfriend about the different disabilities and severities that exist? Did you share your feeling of guilt with him, that may well be stronger in your case due to your work experience? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't recommend any yarn yet, but I'm also interested in exploring the options.

My hypothesis on the superwash is that the treatment that makes wool washable (i.e. removal of scales or polymer/resin coating) also makes it less suitable for soakers. It might become less absorbent, or the resin cover blocks access to the natural lanolin in the wool? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today is the day I overdosed on ginger.

Seen as ginger appears to be the evidence-based go-to cure for pregnancy induced nausea, Mr. Cuppa has been experimenting making his (or my) own ginger beer. The first try didn't work out and he turned the remains (one metric fuckton of ginger root) into and awesome, spicy, lovely ginger cake.

While I was happily chomping away - and there really is a lot of ginger in it - a kind user on my cooking subreddit of choice informed me that ginger was labour inducing and "it depends on the amount". I immediately interrupted my breakfast and started researching and, as with seemingly everything pregnancy related, there do not appear to be conclusive findings on a maximum safe dosage.

What I learned: 1g of ginger a day has been found to be both effective against morning sickness, and safe in all trimesters, with more caution toward the end of the third trimester. One source concluded that eating 1g of ginger equates to drinking 4 cups of ginger infusion, seen as you don't actually eat it. Other sources say up to 5g of ginger have found to be safe, but surprisingly I could not find a single study on the safety of consuming 1 metric fuckton of ginger during the first trimester. Further research is needed to conclusively fill that knowledge gap.

In the meantime, no more ginger cake for me. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey graduates! My 1st baby is due in December and seen as that's this year, my mum will need to register her holiday schedule now, if I want her to come and help out.

My husband works part-time mainly from home, it's so it's not that I'll be alone with the baby. If it actually comes around the due date (Dec 20st) it's quite likely that he won't be working at all.

My mum and I have a great relationship and my husband gets along with her as well. I like the idea of her coming over to help out in the very beginning, the plan being that I take care of myself, Mr. Cuppa takes care of the baby, and mum takes care of the house and feeds us. I trust her to not interfere in an unwanted manner and I'm already mum enough to set clear boundaries with her. She will (suggested this herself - I agree) rent an apartement rather than stay with us.

Now: When should I ask her to block her holidays at work? **In your experience**, did you want more help/company during the last few weeks? Were you happy to have someone there the first week post delivery? Or were you completely fine on your own for two weeks post-partum and wished someone had been there once your nipples were shredded and the freezer food has run out?

I'm aware this will be highly subjective, but I will need to decide very soon and I think your input can be helpful for me to take my own decisions. Thank you! </TEXT>

1. **Fondo pensione** al quale contribuiamo mensilmente, idealmente sfruttando al massimo i vantaggi fiscali. Questi soldi serviranno per comprare casa e/o integrare la pensione.

2. **Risparmio divertimento**, dove teniamo (parte dei) regali di famigliari e amici, che servirà per la prima moto, il giro in Australia, la patente e qualche irresponsabilità finanziaria in prima età adulta.

Per il numero 1. abbiamo già pressoché deciso di utilizzare lo stesso fondo mio. Invece per il 2. siamo insecuri su quale prodotto scegliere. Conto deposito, libretto (non credo che abbiano buone condizioni?). Visto che in prodotti per i bambini sono spesso gratis stavo guardando anche le offerte delle banche locali. Nella vostra esperienza, ci sono banche che offrono tali prodotti anche se i genitori non hanno CC presso loro? I nostri CC sono con webank ed illimity.

Sarei grata per ogni tipo di avviso o esperienze personali. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Subchorionic hematoma without bleeding - anyone else? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-04-30 19:26:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not looking for medical advice, but I'm confused and wonder if there are women who have had a similar experienced. I searched everywhere, but could only find hematoma stories that involve bleeding.

I had my first ultrasound yesterday at 7+2. All was great, baby's heart beats strong and measured at 6+4, which I expected due to long cycles.

Next to the baby was a small shadow, that the gynaecologist guesses is a hematoma. She seemed very surprised though, that I hadn't had any bleeding. I had very light brown witheish creaming spotting for a couple of days early on, but that didn't remotely look like blood.

Her second hypothesis, that she finds less likely, is that it's a second but empty amniotic sac. Luckily I'm already scheduled for a follow-up ultrasound in a week, where I guess I'll learn more. She excludes a second viable fetus because she didn't see a heartbeat, I also couldn't see an embryo.

Now my question is: Did anyone of you have a subchorionic hematoma without any previous bleeeding? Any experience is welcome. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We only just found out that I'm pregnant wiht our first and we would like to cloth diaper. Our local government grants one-time financial support for buying cloth diapers (yay!), but there is no diaper service anywhere to be found, so we will have to wash.

We live in a small apartment and our washing machine is a 9lbs max. front loader. Is there any chance pulling this off with such a tiny machine, or are we better off starting to look into a toploader that can take more weight? When we bought our current machine just a few years ago it was the only front laoder model small enough to fit in this niche, so I don't think buying a different front loader is an option. We don't have a dryer, but sufficient outdoor and indoor space/racks for air drying.

We don't usually produce tons of other washing, our apartment is so small that we can't wash at night, because of the noise. We definitely plan on staying in this apartment for another 2-5 years.

Any suggestions?

Update: Thanks everyone for your suggestions and input! Come the 12-week mark and I‘ll make sure to pester you all about fabrics and brand recommendations for the European market :) Luckily I have a baby-sized teddy bear that can double as a stunt model for our first tries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The other day I made the most awesome Easter loaf using dry yeast. The sachet said to pour it straight into the flour, no need to mix with milk first.

Now I want to make the recipe again. Dry yeast, different brand, I proceed as before. The dough i sticky, the yeast still grainy and the sachet - which I hand‘t read, wrongly assuming dry yeast was dry yeast - clearly says to mix it with milk first. Too late for that.

What do I do now? The recipe says to leave the dough for 2hrs before shaping. Any chance I can knead again after about 30 min, hoping some of the yeast will still mix in?

I want my loaf! Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We‘re an international family and our child will grow up surrounded by English, German and Italian speaking people. I would really like to find a name that is intuitively the same in all three languages. Simon for example would be Simone in Italian, which again is female in German/English. I guess we‘ll have to make do with pronunciation differences, as even Anna and Leo are pronounced differently.

My husband is really adamant that he wants what he calls a „normal“ name. He‘s not very specific about defining that, but I guess he wants a name that doesn’t solicit reactions like „Never heard that before“ or „That‘s unique!“. I personally would be more adventurous, but I‘m perfectly fine with going classical.

My requirement is, that I would like to spare our child a lifetime of spelling their name to people. Even Sara(h) can be spelled with and without the H.

UPDATE: Well, I didn't expect this quite so soon, but now there's actually a (currently poppy seed sized) baby to be named! I finally got my husband around to "maybe"-ing my all time favourites Leon and Leo for boys when it hit me like a brick: Both sound suuuuper similar to his name! So they're out, for good. He's OK'd Emma, but I still want to explore my options further. Currently compiling "the list" to look through with him later. Any more ideas?
So, what have you got, for boys and girls? I would like to go with first and (unused) middle name. Family name starts with a T, one syllable, German/English sounding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello fellow growers! I went on a quarantine induced seeding spree 12 ago, where I seeded the shit out of a collection of ancient year 2012 seeds I had been storing under the worst conditions. Balcony planters only.

To my surprise, everyone (rucola, radish, basil, origano) but parsley (understandable) sprouted beautifully. My only concern is the 4-8 days germination batavia lettuce. I tried my best to keep it at the lowest possible temperature, but during the day it‘s 25 degrees where I am, while at night it drops to 7.

Is there anything I can do after 12 days with no sign of life, or is it time for me to use the planter for more successful crops?

Any advice appreciated. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Free DeGiro 2 ETF portfolio - missing something </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-02-26 09:42:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> After having done my research I'm about to open my portfolio on DeGiro. Before closing the deal I'd be happy if you chime in and point out any obvious newby mistakes I'm about to commit. I will start with 550€ and add 100€ per month. The monthly payment will go up to probably 200€ this summer, and I might have to stop investing at all in about 3 years, when I plan on starting to pay into a pension scheme that will cover the years I have spent at uni. At that point I will just leave my money rest and do its rollercoaster ride for 15-30 years. I'm aware that according to the wiki I shouldn't even be thinking of ETFs, but consider it a new hobby and definitely money can afford to lose, or at least forget about for a long time.

* I want to go with ETFs, seen as I'll park the money for a considerable amount of time (15+ years).
* I would like to go with all stock, seen as I hold a pensions fund and a savings account as well and only invest the money that can cope with high risk.
* The indices I chose to track are MSCI World (80%) and MSCI Emerging markets (20%). I have seen it is generally discouraged to hold more than one ETF with such small investment sums, but seen as there are no trading fees, I though I might as well get both.
* The criteria I have applied in choosing the ETFs are: They're on DeGiros [commission free list](https://www.degiro.ie/data/pdf/ie/commission-free-etfs-list.pdf); they are accumulting; they have a low TER
* The ETFs I came up with are
iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF USD (Acc) - IE00B4L5Y983 and Amundi MSCI Emerging Markets UCITS ETF - EUR (C) - LU1681045370.

My questions are:

* Being in the EU, is it silly to invest in an ETF with USD as the fund currency? I have learned that currency risk is associated with the underlying currencies rather than the fund currency. Is there still a compelling reason why I should avoid buying largely into USD fund currency ETFs?
* There is a yearly fee at DeGiro associated with trading on different stock exchanges, which is the case for the two I chose. Should I ditch the Emerging markets to avoid said fee?
* Most portfolios I have seen here stick with one issuer. Should I avoing buying from two different issuers?

I'd be thankful for any input you might want to share, including the obvious, where my best bet might be ETFs that happen to not be on the free list. Thank you!

<TITLE> How to choose bank/broker to buy ETFs in Italy? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-02-16 18:37:43 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the past year I have been working on sorting out my finances and will soon be able to start investing modest sums. I would like to buy ETFs for 1000€ and then add 100-200€ each month. I should be able to hold it all for 10 years, probably more. I am completely new to the beautiful world of finaces, but I have been trying to do my homework before coming here for advise.

So far I have found plenty of resources on how to choose ETFs and how to build a portfolio. What I have understood is that Italy isn't exactly a paradise for investing. I am currently trying to decide where to actually buy my ETFs, and that's where I am having trouble. I have a Fineco checking account, but if understood it correctly, with my minimal movements (I am not planning on trading a lot), the transaction fee would be 19€. I also have a Santander Consumer savings account, but I think they don't do any trading.

ETF solutions I have come accross that are available in Italy include Degiro, Plus500, ETFmatic and many more. I have tried to figure out which solution is best suited for my situation, but I am having trouble figuring out what to actually look for. Ideally, I would like to know how other Italians on here have chosen where to buy their ETFs. </TEXT>
