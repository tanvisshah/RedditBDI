<TEXT> Honestly, if you can, try to go private. I have battled with the public psych services for three years now and as of this week I've reached my limit with them as they're now actively hindering my mental wellbeing rather than helping me with it. Below is my experience with the public side of it. If anyone knows any private psychiatric services in the West, I'd appreciate the info.


I was referred by my GP three years ago to the HSE psychiatric services. Was treated as an outpatient for PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Appointments were sparse, doctors changed regularly, and i wasn't offered anything but medication. Once I started to feel in any way better they would pass me back to my GP. My episodes tend to be seasonal, so every year my GP would refer me back to them and by the time they'd finally give me an appointment I'd nearly be over the worst of it as I've a good relationship with my GP and they helped me manage my meds. Last year I had a full on breakdown and had to be treated as an inpatient for a week. Only then did my diagnosis get properly reviewed and I got referred for some targeted therapy, but I had to fight every step of the way to even move up the waiting list for that.


The final straw for me with the public mental health services has come just this week past. The psych team are now doing appointments via phone due to covid and I was due to have my first appointment in three months last Thursday. I waited hours and the call never came. Called the secretary and explained my prescription was about to run out and if they weren't going to call me could they at least do me up my prescription so I wouldn't be left without the medication that helps to keep me stable. That was on Thursday, and I am still calling them trying to just get a prescription because I am completely out of my meds. I intent to make a complaint to to the regional complaint officer and I'm currently trying to find access to private psychiatry because I work my ass off to keep myself in good mental health and I am not going to continue to put my life in the hands of a service that can't even ensure I have the medication I need when I need it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm in Europe and I have a shitty family. A lot of shitty family dynamics are passed down through the generations. Bad parenting leads to bad parenting leads to bad parenting. I have cut almost all contact with my family and have been in therapy for almost four years so that I don't continue that cycle. I want to be a good parent and give my future children the love and care that they deserve. It doesn't mean that my heart doesn't hurt on a daily basis because I don't have the relationship I would like with my family, it just means that I have learned to love and value myself more than they ever have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I kind of feel depressed throughout. Like not proper depression, but I just constantly wonder what the point of life is. The overriding symptom is anxiety. Constant anxiety and paranoia. I get bouts of quite severe depression within it, as well as days of feeling really good, but the anxiety is constant throughout all of it. </TEXT>

Yeah I guess needing meds isn't the end of the world, I mean I've been on antidepressants for 10 years so what's the big deal, I guess it will just take me time to come to terms with it if it turns out it's not BPD. Thanks for your comments :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hadn't even considered bipolar 1 to be honest with you. I don't really get massive highs, which I think is a big part of bipolar 1. Like I'll get super positive and productive for a few days but then I crash pretty quickly back into a terrible anxiety and depression which lasts way longer.

I guess I just see bipolar as this big scary thing that couldn't possible apply to me. I'm not trying to downplay BPD in any way, but I was relieved to hear that BPD is managed mainly through therapy and there is a possibility for a normal functioning life if you really work at it. Bipolar just seems way less manageable. You're at the mercy of medication and since there's a genetic link I would really have to think about if I would have children, which would break my heart as I really want to be a mum.

But I guess having the right diagnosis and the right treatment is the most important thing above all else. </TEXT>

Can I ask, what other disorder does this sound like to you? The other diagnosis that has been mentioned by my doctor is bipolar 2, and I don't know how I feel about that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for your comment. Yeah, I've met quite a few people with BPD through therapy and they all say their symptoms are kind of always there, they might be more manageable at times, but they're never gone. For me, I have really severe symptoms for a few months each year and then I am totally normal and functioning for the rest of the time :/ </TEXT>

<TITLE> Having my diagnosis reassessed and possible bipolar 2? </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi there, firstly I would like to say I am not looking for a diagnosis here, just some advice from people that suffer with bipolar 2 to see if what I have been explaining to my medical team resonates with anyone here. I will try to keep this as short as possible and I would really appreciate any advice.

Last August I spent a week in a psychiatric facility due to my mental state. For the past five years, usually in June but no later than July I will feel like a switch gets flipped in my head and I become a completely different person. I become irrational, paranoid, stop sleeping, have panic attacks in public, talk CONSTANTLY and end up shutting myself in my house, punctuated by trips to the city when I suddenly feel great and usually end up spending a lot of money.

These bouts of madness have been getting worse over the years. My first was when I was 20, then I had a few years where the symptoms weren't so bad, but for the last five years they have shown up like clockwork almost every year and as the years go on they are getting more severe and lasting longer (I'm 28 now).

This time, it lasted from June until December, and I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder due to a lot of trauma in my childhood. I accepted the diagnosis, although I did think at the time that a lot of the categories don't fit me, but I was so ill at the time I didn't even trust my thinking.

I am now in an intense DBT program, and this week I was musing about my confusion over how I can go from being SO ill for SO long, then the switch gets flipped back again and I have almost 6 months of completely normal life. My DBT therapist asked me to expand on my experience (he only began seeing me a few months after my diagnosis) and after I explained he said he was going to personally review my file as what I was describing doesn't align with BPD in a lot of ways.

This has made me nervous, but I must admit, BPD never felt like it fitted me, and several people mentioned bipolar 2 before I received psychiatric treatment and a diagnosis.

During my time in treatment I have met many people with BPD, and although I identify with some of the issues, these only apply to me when I am unwell. There seems to be a very clear line for me between when I well and when I am unwell. It's like I'm two completely different people. I've been in therapy for the last three years and have learned so many coping skills and ways to improve my life, but when that switch gets flipped there is nothing I can do to stop the trainwreck happening. It is like the real me shrinks very small and is trapped deep in my brain watching this other me that takes over destroy my life. Can anyone relate to this? Now that I am well again I am just desperate to find out what is really going on with me and what causes these intense, life-ruining, bouts of illness. I don't think I can bear the thought of spending half of every year for the rest of my life being mentally tortured and I just want to find out what it is so I can get proper treatment. If anyone can relate to the switch getting flipped feeling or the watching yourself destroy your life or just any of what I have said, I would REALLY appreciate your feedback.

TL;DR: Diagnosed with BPD in August, therapist has decided to review my diagnosis as it doesn't entirely fit with BPD, wondering if symptoms are more akin with bipolar 2. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't seem to stay in the same job for more than a year. I essentially live to work because it takes everything out of me to put on a happy mask and spend 9 hours a day pretending to be normal. I am exhausted in the evenings and dread having to do it all again the next day. I somehow landed my dream job six months ago, and then had a breakdown two months ago and had to come clean to my boss as to what was going on. My boss has been very supportive and is letting me take as much time as I need to get back on my feet, but I am majorly stressed about having to go back eventually as I struggle with being out of the house and around people and the thought of having to go back to pretending to be normal makes me feel sick. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I apologize if this is lengthy but I don't know where else to turn.

I've been stuck in a spiral for almost two months now. This is the worst it has ever been and the longest it has gone on for. I live with my fiance several hours away from my family and until this time I had never involved my family when I was having a spiral. This time though it got so bad I couldn't be alone (like when my fiance went to work) that my therapist encouraged me to go home to my mum as she was off work at the time. I did, and within a week my mum and my eldest sister had convinced me I needed psychiatric help. They ended up bringing me back to my current city and admitting me to the inpatient psychiatric ward here. While I was in there they texted and called a lot and promised they would always be at the end of the phone if I needed them.

I was diagnosed with BPD while in psychiatric care and discharged after a week as the facility exacerbated my symptoms. I was glad to be home and my mum and two sisters traveled down the day of my discharge to see me.

Since my discharge a month ago, my family have gradually pulled away from me. Several times I tried to contact them all as I was having very bad anxiety and just needed to talk to someone to distract me and help me calm down. On each occasion, all three of them were too busy to talk. At one point it was because they were all going to get their hair done. This hurt so much because they had promised to be there for me, and outside of my fiance and them, I don't have anyone else.

Since then, I have spoken to my mum and my middle sister once on the phone. My middle sister is not comfortable talking about emotions and being reminded of our upbringing and I didn't find her helpful. When I talked to my mum she told me that my oldest sister was now having a hard time coping because of her having to be involved with what I was going through and that she was 'taking a step back.' Although this hurt and made me feel guilty, I accepted it and didn't contact her.

Last week I got a text from my oldest sister saying things were very bad for her, she was barely able to manage, and struggling. She also added that she hoped I was doing well. This message made me so angry because I can see no other point in sending it other than to make me feel bad and guilty for having turned to her in a crisis. I am clearly unable to help her at the moment because I am struggling even to help myself. It felt like punishment.

Since then I have heard from none of them. I am so angry and hurt because my issues stem from being rejected, neglected, and abandoned mainly by my parents for virtually my whole life, and now they are doing it again. I was brave enough and desperate enough to let them in when I needed help most, and now I feel like they have abandoned me all over again because it is simply too hard for them. They don't seem to realize that however bad it feels for them, it is 1000 times worse for me and I feel extremely resentful that the people that caused me to have these issues aren't willing to help me now. I am so disappointed and distraught and it is massively hindering my recovery.

I do understand my oldest sister needing to take a step back to protect her own recovery (she had a nervous breakdown three years ago) but I can't forgive the text she sent me. It just seems incredibly selfish that she was putting her pain on me right now, and essentially confirming that I caused it.

I spoke with my fiance about it last night and I am seriously considering cutting my entire family off. My whole life, I have done nothing but forgive their shitty actions towards me in the pursuit of the love I feel I deserve from them, but all I seem to get is rejection, over and over again and I'm not sure how much more of it I can take. My fiance is also angry at them because they have essentially left the two of us alone to try to cope through this.

Nine months ago I cut my dad off because he was a toxic influence and refused to acknowledge the pain he had caused in my past. It was an extremely hard thing to do, and now I am faced with the prospect of doing it to my remaining immediate family for my own sanity and recovery.

I am going to talk with my therapist about it on Thursday, as she helps me reason these things out. But in the meantime, does anyone have experience with cutting family off while still in crisis? I can't figure out if this is a reaction to feeling abandoned or if I'm justified in this. All I know is that I am extremely hurt over their lack of contact and support, and it is making me go backwards in my recovery. Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR Let family in when at height of crisis and they promised to be there for me, they have now massively stepped back and I feel incredibly abandoned. Considering cutting them off, looking for advice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> BPD diagnosed and go into psychosis when I breakdown. It's basically when I get so sleep deprived, anxious, and stressed that I tip over into psychosis. I start thinking that there is something evil in my head trying to get me to harm myself, innanimate objects are plotting against me, I see things out of the corner of my eyes, and get auditory hallucinations at night. I also start to be unable to distinguish between dreams and waking life.

I was hospitalised due to it for the first time recently. I tried both quitiapine and olazipine antipsychotics. Quitiapine has a rougher adjustment period for me, but I find it much better in the long run as it also works as an anti-anxiety which is one of my biggest symptoms. I also smoke cbd buds which helps with the anxiety too.

My breakdowns follow a pattern over the summer months so once we hit October I'll be weened off the anti-psychotic again and should be fine, once I'm mentally strong enough to go it alone. But there is talk that I will automatically be put back on them next June to prevent another spiral, which honestly I'm okay with because anything is better than feeling like I've completely lost me mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was recently being observed as an inpatient to receive a diagnosis, I do remember the word 'disassociative' being thrown around, but I was honestly too medicated to remember those meetings, and eventually I was told it was BPD.

From just a bit of basic research based on your comment I've found out people suffering with BPD are 75% more likely to also show signs of DID. I knew I got delusional, but I didn't really connect the dots to disassociation. And I definitely don't black out so I get what you're saving about it being 'cousins'.

I'm luck enough that I have been in private therapy for over two years now, and we often talk about my 'Russian doll' self, meaning I have a lot of layers of myself that I revert back to when we dig into past issues, and a lot of them are angry and hurt. I assumed this was meant figuratively but now I'm wondering is this the cause of my "head thing".

I am meeting my therapist tomorrow and I am going to discuss this with her and will also bring this up to my psych doctor when I see him on Monday. I am on a waiting list for DBT but would definitely be interested in sourcing Schema Therapy too if it doesn't clash. </TEXT>

Seriously, I cannot thank you enough for your reply, I feel like a massive weight has been lifted off my chest knowing this is an actual thing and not just me. I'm slightly confused as to why none of my psych team have mentioned this to me, they just sort of nod and write notes when I am brave enough to mention the thing in my head.

<TITLE> DAE think there is an actual thing in their head responsible for their intrusive thoughts (probably multiple TWs) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Firstly, I am terrified to post this in case no one identifies with this and it turns out I'm totally crazy and this isn't a BPD symptom, but I am too afraid to talk to any of my psych docs about this so I have to get it out somewhere.

Since my breakdown two years ago, I have been on and off convinced there is an entity that lives in the back of my head that wants to do me harm and takes over my brain when I have 'spirals' as I call them (read:episodes or breakdowns)

I do get delusional when my anxiety and paranoia get really bad, and the main feature is usually that the thing in my brain is awake and in control and sends me intrusive thoughts like 'Stick your hand in that coffee-bean grinder' or 'throw yourself in front of that car.' I never act on these thoughts, but it's the fighting the urge to act and feeling plagued by being out of control of myself that leads to extreme stress, which leads to extreme anxiety, which leads to further delusions.

When it happened two years ago I was put on anti-psychotics and it went away mostly. This time it has been worse than ever and I've been on anti-psychotics for a month now, but I genuinely can't figure out if I believe in the thing in my head or not. I think I tell myself I don't because I don't want it to be real, I also sometimes believe that if I tell anyone about it it will exact its revenge on me...I know that makes me sound crazy.

Logically, part of me thinks blaming the intrusive thoughts on something physical inside me is probably a coping mechanism. But sometimes I am really convinced, and it worries me because the anti-psychotics are supposed to stop this. My doctors tell me that because I am aware that thinking the thing is real is not right, then it means I'm not properly psychotic.

I'm afraid to tell them that a lot of the time I just say that to convince them (and myself) that it's not real, when really, I'm not so sure. I am afraid that if I tell them the truth they will change my diagnosis to something where I have to be medicated for the rest of my life and that I will pass my illness down to my future children (one of my biggest fears in life.)

If anyone can identify with this, please please comment, as I feel very alone and quite a bit scared that maybe I am not okay at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I understand where you're coming from. It can feel like you're short-changed a lot of the time when you give so much to other people and they don't give it back in the same amount. I think that might be a BPD thing; that we feel so deeply and care so much and people without BPD don't feel in the same way as us so it seems we never get back what we give.

For me, I try to remember that what I'm choosing to give is *my choice* and that I can't give it with the expectation that I will get it back, because not everyone operates the same as me. Even long before my diagnosis, I have held this opinion. It still hurts sometimes, but I try to remember that no one has forced me to love and care so deeply, and I can't force other people to give me that back. So much easier said than done sometimes though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Your comment has made me realise that maybe some of us seek out caregiver/helpful work roles due to our ability to empathize and our want to help others?

I only say this as for four years I worked in customer service where daily I was given a torrent of abuse by so many customers (I worked mainly in complaints) but I lived for those customers I could actually help. And even then, I still wanted to help the horrible ones, it was like something in me just needed to be useful to other people. Although taking in such outright negativity from customers for eight hours straight a day was definitely impacting on my mental health and I didn't really realise how much until I got out of that line of work.

You sound like a really strong person, and it sounds like your empathy enables you to be great at your job, while still protecting yourself.

Honestly, this sub has become a lifeline for me, and the more I talk with people the more it actually helps me to understand myself and helps me to turn that care inward for a change. So, thank you <3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with what you're saying but I have honestly found I have been treated differently since my diagnosis of BPD. For years I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I was seen by outpatient psychiatric services every year for the past three years, and I found the experience positive. I was treated with respect, my wishes were considered in my treatment (not to over medicate, etc) and I felt listened to.

This year, due to my reoccurring delusions and psychosis, my family convinced me to seek inpatient psychiatric care which is where I quickly received the diagnosis of BPD. Since then I have found the attitude of psych to be 'there isn't much we can do for you'. I was told inpatient care was counterproductive, so I was released back home where I am now on a waiting list for DBT. In the meantime, I cannot leave my house because my anxiety is so crippling. In previous years I received a lot of help from psych for this, this year they have more or less said it is up to me to get it under control.

Ironically, I feel abandoned since my diagnosis. However, I am lucky to have an excellent relationship with my GP, and my outpatient psych doctor is somewhat more understanding and helpful, but I don't have access to regular appointments as they see my diagnosis as something they cannot treat.

I wish psych professionals would realize that therapy *is* treatment. It's not a magic pill fix, but I consider myself lucky that I won't have to be medicated for the rest of my life and I will be given access to a program that allows me to work through my trauma and learn real coping skills, something I have not had the opportunity to do for my whole life.

I'm sorry for the rant. I just wanted to explain how I feel my treatment by professionals has changed since my recent diagnosis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My therapist does something similar on me when I am really down on myself. She always asks me would I say any of what I say about myself about someone else. Of course I say no, because I wouldn't dream of it, and then she always asks me why I think it's okay to say it to myself. The only reason I can ever think to give is 'because it's different when it's me.' which I know isn't true. It's just a really hard habit to let go of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like a giant hypocrite as I'm always telling people they are a good person or seeing the best in other people, both IRL and on this sub, and I genuinely feel it and mean it all. I have met one friend IRL that has also recently been diagnosed with BPD and we are both so hard on ourselves but are quick to boost each other with positive and supportive feedback, but we can't do it for ourselves. Is this a trait of BPD? I wish I knew how to be as nice to myself as I can be to other people. I think it would make living with this a lot easier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel the exact same. All I want in life is to have children and love them with my whole heart and be a good mother in every way I possibly can. My biggest fear is being a bad parent. My mother suffered with depression and alcoholism for most of my childhood/adolescence. She in turn was raised by a bad mother, and the cycle repeats backwards from there.

I am so determined to break that cycle and not bring my children into the world for the wrong reasons and I hope to never put my own selfish needs before my children.

I know I won't be a perfect parent, but I sure as hell hope I can be a damn sight better than the ones that raised me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have much advice to give, except to say that I relate to your feelings of wanting to tell them everything vs wanting to push them away to protect them. My SO is my FP and I struggle with this every day.

/u/trashyberries recently shared a video I found really helpful to explain BPD in a non-biased, thoughtful, and beautiful way. I showed it to my FP too and it helped them to understand. So I'll leave it here in case it might be some help to you. I think it explains very well the 'push/pull' that a lot of us feel with people we care about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iraGmA7-9FA

<TEXT> > You are not going to better in the morning as much as you want to be, but you will be a little better.

Thank you, that's a good way of putting it. I know I can harness my impatience to get me to where I need to be. I'm just struggling to accept that I am still in 'crisis', as my sister calls it. In my head, because they released me from the hospital a week ago, I feel like I am now in 'recovery'. But to be fair, I can't leave the house, my anxiety is through the roof, and I am still dissociating when I get stressed, so I guess I am still in a bad place right now mentally. But every day I am working on it, trying to work through my emotions and do the right things for myself. And those little things will hopefully build over time until I am 'me' again. </TEXT>

But I feel like if I stop aiming to be better then I'm giving up. But, thankfully, today the impatience is a little less crushing, so I'm thankful for that. </TEXT>

I try not to abuse my Valium and only take it when I really need it and even now it's not working. Nothing triggered this today, it's just there and I am stuck trying to deal with it and I don't know how! I tried deep breathing, meditation, smoking some CBD buds. Everything only works for a tiny amount of time before the brick falls on my chest again. All I can do is stay on this sub and keep posting.

<TEXT> I hear you. Agoraphobia and anxiety are the pillars of my issues during Summer months especially. Going into town is akin to climbing Mt. Everest for me right now. My senses are so heightened, I cannot bear to be seen, I feel like everyone can see my internal (and sometimes external) freaking out. I can't even leave the house if my SO isn't with me. At the moment I only leave for doc appointments or therapy sessions, and even then it exhausts me.

One thing I find that helps is not to focus on the whole journey, just the next step. Step one is get out of bed and get dressed. Only focus on that. Once it's complete, focus on step two. Leave the house and get on the bus/get in the taxi.

Also, the longer I leave it between visits out of the house the worse it will be next time so I try to get out of the house once a day. Even if it is just to walk to the end of the road and back. Some days I can't do it, but it's still a goal I set myself every day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Urgh, I struggle with this so much. My dad had an affair and left when I was 9, my mum became an alcoholic and I was left alone with her, caring for her, and she would cover up her problem by saying I was such a bad child that she needed to drink to cope. I feel like I've been dealing with my emotions towards my mum my whole life, and she's now 4 years sober and has actually been a great support to me and is always open to acknowledging the extreme shit she put me though which helps me heal, so I now find it difficult to look back and acknowledge her responsibility as I understand she had an addiction.

My dad on the other hand...I absolutely idolized him my whole life. He was my one stable parent. Yet he wouldn't let me go live with him because it would fuck up his perfect new life with his mistress and he never acknowledged that he broke our family. He also became such an asshole when my mum got sober and I began to have a relationship with her again. Eight months ago I completely blew up at him and my step-mum and finally said all the things I had been holding in about how he fucked me up too. He literally walked out and we haven't spoken since. So yeah, I feel a lot of anger towards my dad because he flat out refuses to acknowledge that he did anything wrong or is in any way to blame for my issues.

I don't want to spend the rest of my life hating my parents. I know I can't go back and change the past and I need to learn to accept it and live with it. But it is so incredibly hard. Almost three years of therapy and I'm still struggling with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly, it's like everything else, if you do it long enough it will become a habit. But I find it is one of the hardest things to break. I try to do something similar, like be productive for x amount of hours in the day by cleaning, cooking, exercising etc and then I tell myself if I get all of that done I'm allowed to sit down and relax. It sort of works, but the nagging guilt is always somewhere in the back of my head. I have to work really hard to keep it under control. There are days where getting out of bed is as productive as I can be, and then that horrible voice floods in telling me I should be able to do more and I'm a failure. I'm working hard to shout against it and tell it that some days just simply being is enough. </TEXT>

Honestly, I don't know how to stop the 'wrong' - I just keep trying everything I can think of that isn't destructive. Being creative in some way is the closest I come to feeling okay. I write down all my thoughts, or when my head is racing too fast to write I actually record myself talking into my laptop just to get the thoughts out. Just yesterday I went and bought a bunch of old magazines from a charity shop and I've been cutting stuff out of them to make a collage about all my feelings.

Initially I was happy with the diagnosis, because after 18 years of struggle I was relieved to finally have a label that fit. But over the past week or so I've started to realise it still doesn't account for a lot of things. But I do think I need to accept that, like any mental illness, not every person experiences it exactly the same and particularly with BPD it can be varied. I think I'm just going through a process of acceptance. I will query it with my psych doctors though and see what they say. Thanks for your comment! </TEXT>

It doesn't have to make sense and you don't have to show it to anyone, just write down the thoughts in your head. Don't overthink, make spelling and grammar mistakes, just write and get the thoughts and feelings out. Use pen and paper or type it, doesn't matter. Write for as long as you need to and then read back over it and see what you've said. I can usually then identify what the emotions are (I can cycle through like 10 different emotions in the space of 4 pages of writing) and it helps me to see what I'm thinking and label it and it also helps just to get it out even if you don't understand what you've written, at least it's not still bouncing around in your head.

Sorry I realise you didn't ask for advice. But I do understand the horrible confusion of not knowing what you're thinking and feeling and I just thought I'd share what sometimes helps me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently diagnosed with BPD and have been smoking weed increasingly over the past few years. My SO smokes and has no issues but I find when I am falling into a breakdown spiral I will start smoking it more to try to blur my thoughts. I've been advised by my psych doctors that weed can make psychosis worse, which I get when I'm really bad, so I've stopped smoking it. I've replaced it instead with legal CBD buds. Its good for managing anxiety but doesn't get you high or fuzzy-headed as the THC isn't present. Plus it tastes and smells the exact same, which is part of what I liked about weed, so I'm finding it to be a helpful replacement for the real thing. That might be something you could look into for your girlfriend. I also asked my psych doctor about smoking the CBD stuff and asked if it is likely to have any negative effect and he said he's totally fine with it. But that is just my own doctors opinion and I'm not trying to give medical advice, just letting you know my experience with it. Hope this helps. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have had multiple panic attacks/breakdowns in different jobs, it's part of my spiral that nearly every year I lose it at work. Usually I hide in the toilet until the worst of it is over. An understanding boss is invaluable in these situations. I recently had to admit to my new boss that I wasn't coping and I needed some time off for my mental health. It's a hard thing to do but the stress of trying to stay normal at work is a big thing. I don't know where you're based but what I usually do is go to my doctor when it gets that bad and they give me a medical cert to say I'm temporarily unfit for work at the moment. And I then take the time I need to start getting back on track. Sometimes its two weeks, sometimes its two months. This time I've been off for a month so far and I'm nowhere near going back yet. My advice is to go see your doctor and put work on pause right now, you need to look after yourself first. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Struggling to understand my diagnosis of BPD </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-08-22 12:16:29 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all, I'm new here. Although I had heard of BPD a long time ago and actually thought I might have it about 10 years ago, I was only officially diagnosed less than two weeks ago after a stay in a psychiatric facility. Since then I have been trying to come to terms with it but I can't really get my head around it or figure out how I really fit into it. A little background:

Originally my family and I thought I might have bi-polar as my symptoms follow the same pattern every year from June until mid-Sept and I go through highs and lows and also end up in psychosis. Every year around June it's like a switch goes in my head and I stop being able to sleep, then I start questioning the point of life, then the suicidal ideation starts, I start getting panic attacks, being very emotional at home, then the paranoia and delusions start, and then I need to be medicated to even basically cope. I also stop being able to leave the house and only feel safe at home. This pattern has been very apparent for the past 4 years but it has been happening in one way or another since I was at least 20 (I'm 28 now) but was never really documented by medical professionals until 4 years ago as I moved around a lot before then. During the rest of the year I cope pretty well, but that is thanks to private therapy for the past 2 and a half years.

Originally, back when I was 20, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I accepted that. During my assessment by psych, I originally resisted the diagnosis of BPD. Over a few days I did some basic research of symptoms and causes and came to terms with the fact that it does actually explain some of my behaviors and since then I have been trying to educate myself and lean into the diagnosis as I very much want to learn to cope and thrive despite the diagnosis.

I am on a waiting list for DBT but it could take up to 6 months before I get started. In the meantime, I'm trying to get my life back to some semblance of normality by trying to learn all I can online. My biggest problem is that the more I research the more hopeless I feel. All I read is that BPD is akin to getting the worst mental health diagnosis as its hard to treat, extremely stigmatized, and is basically code for 'difficult person'. I find that really hard to deal with as I have worked really hard on myself through therapy and I don't consider myself a difficult person all year round, just during these Summer spirals.

Other reasons I don't feel I fit BPD is because I am in a stable relationship for 5 years and got engaged in the last year. I have maintained long friendships and have good relationships with people. I haven't self-harmed or attempted suicide in 12 years (although I do binge-eat a lot and have trouble with erratic spending when I'm on a high). I don't lash out at people or act out, instead I tend to internalize my pain and use it to beat myself up. I don't really fear people abandoning me, in fact sometimes I wish all the people that loved me would just abandon me so they wouldn't have to go through trying to help me. I do however feel incredibly isolated and alone despite the support I have, and I have always felt inherently broken at my core. I feel like this diagnosis confirms that in some way.

I have tried reading articles online, listening to podcasts, different websites, but I can't seem to find anything that seeks to help someone understand BPD in an unbiased/non-judgmental way. The only thing I have found helpful is this sub! I would be really grateful if anyone could point me in the direction of good material that is helpful in understanding BPD as I am desperate to relate to something at the moment and ease this isolation. Any input is appreciated.

TL;DR: Diagnosed two weeks ago, don't feel I fit the diagnosis in a lot of ways, feeling isolated and looking for good sources of information to better understand my diagnosis. </TEXT>

It's at the point now where I can't leave my house unless my SO is with me and even then I cannot go into built-up/crowed areas. I feel totally trapped in my own head and a prisoner in my own home. Can't even go to the shop to buy milk alone. It's extremely isolating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have become even more obsessed with my dog during my recent downswing. She is literally the reason I get up in the morning and I am just totally in love with her. I also love my SO with all my heart but there is just something about my dog that gives me strength and soothes me. I didn't think it could be BPD related until I saw this thread, as I was wondering why she is SUCH a big obsession for me right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My intolerance to sound is one of my main issues when I'm in an episode. I feel way too tuned into everything and even a clock ticking can aggravate me. I'm not so bad with touch if it is someone I know and trust, but if it's a stranger I get immediately angry. Sound also makes me angry. Not externally, but inside I am boiling with rage. I think this is why I always have really bad episodes in Summer. Too much noise and too many people just amplify my reactions and I have to avoid all crowded spaces for long stretches of time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been using CBD buds as I used to smoke proper stuff with THC but don't want to add to my symptoms. I don't know if it's actually doing anything for my anxiety but for me it's a great replacement for the real stuff as it tastes almost exactly the same so in that way it works for me as a placebo. I have friends that use the tincture and swear by it for easing their anxiety over time, but it might be different for everyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you so much for this post. I was diagnosed 10 days ago with BPD, and while it was a relief to finally get a diagnosis, it didn't quite fit as I rarely "act out". Seeing your post has led me to read up on Quiet BPD and I feel this fits my behavior and symptoms a lot better and has helped me to understand my diagnosis a bit better. Quiet BPD was not mentioned to me by my psychiatrist but I will talk with him about this at my next appointment. I feel like I have a direction with this now. I hope your treatment goes well! I'm currently on a waiting list for DBT therapy and trying to cope with how I feel on my own in the meantime. </TEXT>

<TEXT> >I've heard him say it several times.

Yeah the reason I asked is because this can be a coping mechanism. I call it 'carroting', you're dangling the carrot of happiness in front of yourself, believing if only you can get this one thing then things will then magically be okay. I think everyone does it to some degree but it becomes a problem when you begin to fixate on this new flavour of the month being the be all and end all of your happiness and then you can't cope if it doesn't work out exactly like you imagined and it creates a depression spiral.

>I can't deny that I have acknowledged how hurt I feel when he says he isn't happy with his life.

Of course you're hurt! Having someone tell you that they're not happy in a life that you prominently feature in is going to be devastating, and naturally you're going to wonder what you could have done better or how maybe it could have worked if x was different. Please be very careful of this, you end up falling into the same trap he is in. I know it's hard to hear, but it may be the case that your relationship in some way has been the shiny thing ( I don't mean to trivialise your relationship at all, just casting around for metaphors) that has been keeping him going, and now he feels this shiny thing isn't working, and the bad news is he will ALWAYS feel like this about each new shiny thing, be it a job, a house, a relationship UNTIL he deals with the root cause.

I completely understand your reluctance to let him go. As you've said, he's a great guy, but the change has to come from him. You can say it 1,000 different ways, you can counsel him and prop him up and encourage him until you have nothing left to give. But he won't change until he makes the decision to change.

Nothing you say or do will change that. Nothing you could have said or have done will change that. You seem like a smart and caring person, please be smart enough to care about yourself first and foremost.

<TEXT> >there is always an external factor preventing him from being happy

If there is ALWAYS something preventing him from being happy then chances are that the root cause of that is not external.

If he's not willing to try to get to the bottom of it, realistically, he is highly unlikely to be able to sustain contentedness for any real period of time. Maybe it's as simple as he needs to learn better coping skills and an outlet for his stress, but unless he actively wants to help himself there is only so much help you can give him.

I'm sorry that you and your relationship is the newest thing he thinks is the reason for his unhappiness, but if he has a habit of always blaming some circumstance in life for his unhappiness, it sounds like your relationship was just the next thing in the firing line (I know that doesn't help you not take it personally and i genuinely feel for the position you're in)

Out of interest, does he use phrases like 'If only I can get x sorted, things will be better.' Or 'If only I had this/this thing would happen then I'd be happy.' ?

<TEXT> He admits to crying every day, feeling unhappy, withdrawn from friends and family - all classic signs of depression. You say he doesn't want to speak to a therapist, but would he at least consider going to his doctor and discussing it? I'm not saying he should just get meds, but speaking with a medical professional might help him to see that there are ways to get help and he doesn't have to feel like he's alone in this or that he's just crazy for feeling this way.

However, when it comes to you, I think you need to "detach with love" from him. You're not abandoning him, you're simply taking a step back to protect yourself. And I say this because it sounds like what you're doing now (seeing him several times a week, staying over) is not helpful to either of you and he will use you as an emotional punching bag if he stays in this cycle without getting help. Let him know that you are there for him as a friend, but that you are hurt by your breakup and need to look after your own mental wellbeing at the moment too. You running yourself down along with him won't help anyone.

And just to note, I say all this as someone that did what your boyfriend did. I got into a depression spiral, broke up with my partner because I didn't feel I was worthy and didn't want to burden them, but then I used them as an emotional sponge anyway. I wish my ex had put in some emotional boundaries with me to save himself, and it would have done me a favour too. I still regret putting him through what I did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been where you have been. In fact I did something similar and worse and I know the insane guilt, self-hatred, and helplessness that comes with hurting the person you love most because you were taken back to that unsafe place.

Trust me when I say I hated myself to my very core when I realised what I'd done. I cried non stop, I couldn't look at my boyfriend, and his understanding and forgiveness somehow made it worse. I was frightened of what I was capable of and I felt like I didn't deserve his forgiveness.

But we resolved it. I went to therapy and worked on the issue, the trigger of my outburst, and being able to forgive myself. And although it was one of the toughest things to do, I worked through it with my therapist and my boyfriend and I are stronger than ever over two years later and I haven't had another outburst since.

I understand that pit of despair you have put yourself in as punishment, but you really need to be kind to yourself at a time like this, even if you feel you don't deserve it. Do the best thing you can do for yourself, and work on this with your therapist. I found the fear of dealing with the issue was actually worse that dealing with it, and the relief I got was huge.

I wish you all the love and support in the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OP, you post reminds me a lot of how I felt 6 months ago. Been with bf 4 years, last year I found the perfect ring for me, which prompted us to talk seriously about getting engaged. We both agreed we wanted to marry each other and my bf told me to show him the ring, and he'd pick it and propose in a way he wanted to do it, even giving me the time line of sometime near the beginning of 2018. For that year my bf would tell me he knew I was going to love my proposal etc and I couldn't stop thinking about it and getting engaged and I was so excited for it. Until the beginning of 2018 my bf told me he didn't think he could do the mystery proposal anymore and I was crushed. To cut a long story short my bf totally fucked up his time line and everything to do with it really and when I realised that I kind of lost it because I felt like he didn't care about me or getting engaged when it all came to light. I took a few days away to think and when I came back we had a loooong talk about how the miscommunication over the proposal was probably a symptom of something bigger in our relationship and that we needed to work on being clearer with each other about what we want and where we see ourselves going together, and how to get there. In the meantime, I told him the proposal is off the table until I get over my hurt of what happened, because if he had turned around the following weekend and proposed to me after I had been so upset, I honestly wouldn't have been able to enjoy an event I had been looking forward to for so long because I'd feel like it was overshadowed by all the upset about it. We're six months on from the blow up about the proposal, and we're doing better than ever and still working on communicating correctly with each other. For now, I still haven't put the proposal back on the table yet, but it's something I'm strongly thinking about.  But when I get the feeling like 'maybe it's time we got engaged now' I just remind myself that we're both in this for the long run and a ring on my finger doesn't change that. We have all the time in the world, so it'll happen when we're both good and ready. I don't know of any of this will help you, but I just wanted to say I know how it feels to think youve been strung along about something so important, and it hurts like hell. But maybe you guys really need to work on getting back to living in the same state to spend more time together as a first step and let the engagement take a back seat.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been in a similar situation. I moved in with my current partner after 9 months together and it caused frequent arguments in our relationship for the first while.

I moved into his place and felt like a guest, we had different ways of doing things, different ways to de-stress after work etc. It's not easy to take your life and meld it with someone else's and just expect it to work. It takes time and patience and compromise on both sides.

You mention that it feels like you two never really make up and the arguments can happen over anything. It's sounds to me like the two of you are constantly living on the defensive with each other, and that is completely exhausting and will keep leading to more and more arguments because both of you are hyper aware of the other.

You need to sit down and have a really honest talk about what is at the root of the issue. Is it sharing space? Is it how you both spend your time? Is it that the dynamic of your relationship has changed since the move? Maybe it's a mix of a lot of things. You need to work together to work out where the issues lie and come up with a plan on how you are both going to work towards improving.

If you have this conversation and your boyfriend indicates that he's not willing to compromise on anything, then you've got a bigger problem and you need to look at what is really best for you in the long run.

But I just want to say, if you're both willing to admit your faults and work on improving, there is hope. I've been there and I'll be happily living with my SO two years next month. It's not all happiness and rainbows, but it doesn't have to be constant fights and tension either. Best of luck, OP!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the middle of a secondry school exam in which we had a certain amount of time to finish a section of questions.

My friend was sitting at the desk next to me and she had finished the section we were on ahead of time and was trying to throw things at me to ruin my concentration.

I manage to ignore her until I finish, also ahead of time, and I decide to retaliate. So I took my ruler and jabbed her in the side with it. The jab startles her so much she let's out a hugely loud fart in a packed exam hall. Both of us went to pieces laughing and I was made to leave the exam hall because I was crying so hard with laughter.

Totally worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is actually a really relevant thread for me this week.

My mother has been an alcoholic for 15 years. 8 of those years she was more or less functioning, I was a pre teen when her alcoholism started, I was the only one that was living with her and knew about it, although I was so young I didn't even realise what was happening at the time. I thought alcoholics were old men that sat in bars all day, I didn't realise my mum drinking three bottles of wine a night alone was a problem.

My mum seriously mentally abused me and occasionally physically abused me. As her drinking progressed and I grew older the rest of the family found out. My mum was in and out of rehab and was declining. I cut contact and moved away. I didn't speak to her for four years.

I was seriously messed up because of it, self-harm, drug abuse, suicide attempts. I had a complete mental breakdown and ended up on antidepressants (which I'm still on). I was blinded by the anger I held for my mum. I resented the very core of her being for what she had done to me.

Two years ago my mum was taken into hospital critically ill and put into an induced coma. They didn't expect her to live. Her organs began to shut down and she was having heart attacks and strokes while in the coma. I was so angry, I wasn't ready for her to die, I hadn't made her pay for all the things she'd done to me.

Against the odds she lived, and actually made a near enough full recovery. And she began drinking again.

Six months after her near death I realised I was letting her control my life even though I wasn't even in contact with her. I blamed her for everything that had gone wrong in my life and for my depression. I didn't believe I could ever get better or break the cycle. I went for counselling.

Within two months of starting my counselling I met up with my mum to try to form some sort of relationship. Fast forward to now, over a year later, and my mum is four months sober (the longest in 10 years) and is in a program. I'm moving away this week so two days ago my mum calls me and asks me to meet that evening.

I meet her and she explains she's there to try to make amends for everything she did to me. She said she was there to hear how everything she had done had affected me and for me to let loose on her essentially. This was an opportunity I had spent many years hoping for, to make her realise just how much hell she had put me though.

But to my utmost surprise I told her I didn't have any anger or resentment towards her anymore, I had made my own peace with it, and I realised I really meant it. We had a really long talk and she admitted to all the terrible things she had done, tried to show it to me from her point of view and apologised for everything, saying she will forever feel guilt and regret for the childhood she robbed me of. And I told her that that was punishment enough, knowing that she did those things, she has to live with that. I didn't feel I needed to add anything more to that. I've come to terms with my past and all I ever wanted was her to acknowledge all the things she had done.

OP, I know the anger you feel and if someone had told me two years ago that I would have a relationship with my mother, never mind a good one, and that I wouldn't hate her, I would have laughed in their face. But in the end I realised the only person I was hurting by continuing to be angry and resentful was myself.

My mother is an alcoholic and she will drink or not drink of her own accord, how I feel about it won't change that, all I have control of is how I choose to deal with it.


Sorry for the long post, just felt good to write this out!

TL;DR Alcoholic mum messed up a lot of my life, I hated her, went to therapy, made peace and now have a good relationship with her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My boyfriend is SERIOUSLY allergic to all kinds of nuts. He's part of the 1% that even if he smells nuts he will get violently ill. He is also allergic to cats (not their fur, their skin) has bad hayfever and takes a reaction to onions.

The nut allergy means I cant eat anything with even trace nuts nor can we ever go to a chinese or indian restaurant because they use nut oil in cooking. Absolutely no food or sauces with onions, never having a cat (which breaks my heart because I'm a big cat person) and never going outside on sunny days because of pollen.

Is it hard? Hells yes. I love chinese food and peanut butter, but now that we live together those things are no longer options for me. He was up front about the nut allergy from the get go, because he had to. But the rest I found out over time.

A lot of people I tell about his allergies ask me how I put up with it because they would be deal breakers for them but what can I say, I love him and those are just sacrifices I have to make. It does annoy me/make me sad sometimes that there are a lot of things off limits to us because of his allergies but they're not his fault. He can't help these things and he makes the effort to do things that we can actually do together and he makes sacrifices for me too, that's just a good relationship.

I really hope this girl is understanding of your allergies but even if she's not have faith that there is a girl out there that will be, because when you love someone enough you'll be willing to sacrifice some things, even things you thought you wouldn't before you met them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah my boyfriend has said himself he needs a bit of time when he comes home just to unwind and I've tried to take it on board it's just difficult when I sometimes go all day with no real human interaction until he gets home but we're both working on it.

I guess I just find it difficult because his style of living is a lot different than mine, he's very laid back and doesn't think to just do a lot of stuff so I feel I spend a lot of time asking/reminding him to do things and I just don't like not feeling myself. I find myself taking my frustrations out on him or just around him and I hate myself for doing it I don't have anyone else right now to vent to.

I know this is probably just all temporary, I will eventually settle and get to know more people I'm just finding it increasingly difficult to stay positive and I'm worried I'll tear apart my relationship in the process. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Me [24F] with my boyfriend [30 M] 10 months. Feeling lonely and I'm putting pressure on my relationship since I moved to a new town to live with my boyfriend. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2015-07-28 14:18:38 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I moved in with my boyfriend about a month ago. I was pretty anxious about it because I was moving to his town and leaving my friends and my comfort zone behind.

I've been finding it tough since I moved in with him. I've been unemployed for quite a while now and although I have been applying for jobs constantly in this town (first thing I do every morning) I've had no luck. I only know one person in this town and she's not available a lot to hang out. Plus my closest friend moved half way around the world recently so I don't get to talk to her much. I joined a weekly exercise class in this town and I really enjoy it and getting out of the house but once a week just isn't enough. I've looked into meetup.com to try to meet people here but this is a small town with not a lot going on so there are basically no groups to join.

I go out around the town during the day, go walking, I still have my hobbies like reading, writing etc but I can't help but feel very lonely and out of place a lot of the time.

My SO works full time and he likes to come home and switch off in the evenings. I have talked to him about how I need a little more from him at the minute until I feel settled and he is trying but it just makes me feel worse that I'm relying on him to be my main support at the moment. My loneliness coupled with teething problems of living together has put a lot of pressure on the relationship recently and caused some fights. We are working through it and doing well it's just that I feel I'm much more edgy and cranky around him all the time now because I'm couped up all day in a house I don't like in a town I don't like with no one to talk to.

On top of this my two sisters actually live in the town I've moved to and I was looking forward to being closer to them when I moved but this seems to have coincided with both sisters distancing themselves from me. I haven't seen or spoken to one of them in two weeks when we'd usually talk and meet up all the time, and the other only uses me for babysitting duties. I feel like I've pissed them off somehow which gets to me because I'm close with my family and really need a support system at the moment but I feel like I've been abandoned.

I've had depression for years and am on medication for it and haven't had a serious depression spiral in over a year but recently I find myself crying all the time, getting less and less motivated because everyday is the same and I don't see the point in doing anything, basically I feel like I'm slipping. I work really hard to keep myself focused and productive so I don't spiral but recently it's just getting harder and harder.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here, advice on how to not feel so lonely and how to adjust and feel settled here? How not to take it out on my SO and not slip back into depression. I've moved around plenty and I've moved countries in the past I've just never found it this hard or taken this long to adjust. Any advice on how to make it easier would be appreciated.



**tl;dr**: Moved to a new town to live with my bf a month ago. Feeling lonely and unsettled, taking it out on my relationship and feel like I'm slipping into depression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just thought I'd throw my two cents in here. My boyfriend and I don't cook together/for each other because we have very different tastes (he is very plain, I like lots of veggies and different dishes). But at the start of the relationship he would occasionally cook 'homemade' food for us and leave such a mess.

We always adhered to whoever cooks doesn't have to clean but I am someone that naturally cleans as I go but he is definitely not. He would leave pots and pans piled up in the sink and sauce all over the surfaces etc.

Honestly it got to the point where I just blew up and told him that it's not acceptable to leave the place in a total mess just because he cooked considering I didn't do the same to him.

Now that we live together (and I gained a ton of weight from eating what he cooked) we cook separately, clean up our own mess and don't argue about it. I don't make him eat what I cook and vice versa and we don't go near the kitchen when the other is cooking. Also if the kitchen is left in a mess one of us can turn around and ask the other to clean because it is clear who the mess belongs to.

I'm not saying this is the definite solution for you, not sharing a meal together kind of makes me sad because it feels like I'm missing out a bit, but if you hate the food he cooks and hate having to clean up his mess tell him from now on he can cook and clean for himself and you can make food you actually like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think working on confidence just for the purpose of dating doesn't really work. To portray true confidence you need to be confident in your everyday life by having genuine self confidence all round.

People aren't just attracted to you when you're out on the prowl in a bar, people notice you having a chat to the cashier in the shop and just your general demeanor in day to day life. If you seem easy going, chatty and approachable people are more likely to notice you and talk to you.

ANd I don't say this as a confident person, I say this as someone that's dating a confident person. The amount of random people that strike up conversations with my SO seems crazy to me, but it's because he's constantly smiling and making eye contact with people and comes across very approachable. </TEXT>

Current SO bought me an illustrated book of Oscar Wilde's children's stories because I told him about how my dad bought me a copy when I was young and sick and it meant a lot to me but I lent it to someone and never got it back. I cried when he gave me the new copy because I wasn't expecting it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd be fine with it. I'm not overly materialistic so I don't have much either. I recently moved and had eight bags of clothes and four small boxes of stuff, which was mainly sentimental bits and pieces, and one chair. I don't hang on to things I don't need in my life.

Dating someone that has minimal stuff would be preferable to dating someone that has waaay too much pointless stuff, like my current SO. He can't seem to get rid of anything. For example there is a piece of styrofoam sitting on our dresser because he got it at a gig. Which would be fine if the entire house wasn't covered in stuff like this. I can't throw anything out because it might be related to some event or he might need it one day.

 Dating a minimalist person would be a relief at this stage! And as long as you don't insist on having minimal stuff forever, you gotta be willing to compromise on stuff like that to build a home with someone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh hells yes. My 'relationship with food' got so out of control in the last year that I've piled on countless pounds because I was relying on food for my happiness and as a reward system for just getting through the day as a way to stave off depression spirals.

But in the end up I just ended up making myself more miserable because I was depending on food to get me through. I went and spoke to my old therapist on a one off session about it who helped me identify why I was eating the way I was and how to change my habits. I'm currently two and a half weeks into a new diet and exercise plan and I'm actually sticking to it, essentially it's actually all about changing your relationship with food. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You should definitely get this checked out by a doctor! My sister had the same thing, bad hip pain, usually just in one side, for a few days leading up to her period and during as well. It got so bad she could hardly walk when it was happening.

She went to her doc about it and they thought it was possibly endometriosis. They sent her for a smear and tests and now her smear has come back irregular so she's had to go for more tests and the docs aren't sure yet what it is.

Please don't be like my sister and leave it until the pain becomes unbearable to get it checked out. If something does show up on her tests I know she will seriously regret not having got it checked out earlier on.

<TEXT> Money is a very minimal part of it for me. I wouldn't care about dating someone who is unemployed as long as I knew they were actively looking for work and able to responsibly manage the money he does have.

Honestly if a guy has a good job and is comfortable that is slightly more attractive because I know he's a stable and responsible person but it doesn't factor in more than that. Buckets of money would mean nothing  because I'm not a materialistic person and I definitely wouldn't go for someone who I didn't have a real connection with just because of money.

OP if you're attracting the kind of women that wants to be wined and dined in expensive places and a lot of your interactions are revolving around spending money then be wary. If you can take a girl to the park for a cheap picnic and you enjoy each other just cuddling up on the couch with a movie and money doesn't regularly come up in conversation then that would be the kind of person I would focus on more than someone that seemed more interested in my money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't believe in needing someone as in I couldn't cope emotionally without them, like I need them to be there for me all the time or something like that. I've worked hard to be my own emotional rock a lot of the time.

However I do believe that if you're in a relationship with someone you should want to need them sometimes, if that makes sense. You should be able to rely on them for support when you feel you need it. You should be able to be there for each other when one or both of you are going through tough times. To me that's a big part of being partners with someone. I think  when needing becomes needy is when one person feels they need the other but cannot rely on the other person or the other person isn't willing to give as much.

It's a tricky one to try to portray feelings on now that I think about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was 19 when we met, he was 23. We were together for two and a half years before I ended it because of a lot of reasons (his drinking, unreliability, too much fighting, to much hurt being caused). We continued to sort of see each other/sleep with each other on and off for three months after. Eventually that blew up too and I moved countries and we didn't speak for 10 months.

He was visiting my country for a few weeks and he got in touch, we met up and we were both in a better place and had realised a lot about our relationship. We couldn't help but fall for each other again (considering we hadn't stopped loving each other it wasn't hard.) When he went back to his country we decided to make it long distance. I visited him twice in six months but on the second visit we realised that neither of us was willing to move again to make it work and we couldn't keep it going the way it was so we ended it. But we kept in contact calling each other every few weeks.

About four months after we'd ended the long distance he asked me one more time if I'd ever consider moving back to him and I said I wouldn't. We didn't talk much after that. I spoke on the phone to him three months ago and he told me that if I had said on that call that I would even consider moving back for him he would have been willing to pack his stuff then and there and would have come straight back to me. He needed me to be open to taking a leap of faith for us, but since I wasn't he decided he couldn't uproot his life again for me.

That was the last time I spoke to him. I've tried to call him since but he never picks up. It sucks because I miss him as a friend, but I'm in another relationship now and eventually you just gotta let this stuff go.

I don't regret getting back with him, but it was definitely painful and it probably would have been better if we'd just stayed no contact from the start. But you live you learn. </TEXT>

Every single one of my dreams is crammed full of anxiety filled situations and confrontation because I'm a complete worrier and my mind is always going full speed. For a full week recently I had dreams that I was locked in a prison/mental institution/kept against my will.

<TEXT> I feel terrible for you and your husband absolutely should not have said that to you. When you are with someone, especially the person you chose to marry, I believe you should think they are the most beautiful person *to you*. Not just because of how they look but because of their personality, how they make you feel etc. I have put on a lot of weight in my current relationship and don't feel very beautiful a lot of the time but my SO makes me believe that he thinks I'm the sexiest thing going and our sexs life is great. If he made me feel shit about how I look I guarantee I wouldn't have the confidence to change in front of him never mind have sex with him!

Is it possible that your husband knows that it's very important to you to feel hot and desired and in the course of the argument he got defensive and decided to lash out and hit you in an area that he knew would really hurt you? He probably had no idea how deeply it would hurt you which is why he should not have said it in the first place. Intentionally trying to hit a deep nerve in the person you love is never acceptable no matter the argument.

I don't know what to tell you in terms of repairing this if your husband is dismissing your hurt and your reasons for it. He should understand why this is important to you and he should be doing his damndest to try to build you back up after knocking you so severely down.

If he's not willing to work on this and realise how important this is to you I hope he's happy to never have sex again, and OP I don't blame you whatsoever for not wanting to be intimate with him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't offer any tricks for the crying except to say just let it out. Sometimes your body just has to get rid of the emotion and a good cry can help that.

Honestly when I get teary on my period I indulge myself. Chocolate, a good movie and a little day of pampering myself to make myself feel better. To me it feels completely different from being actually upset over something genuine.

For example I'm pms-ing this week and my bf was emailing me about his life insurance plan, I ended up balling my eyes out on the couch for a good 20 minutes about the thought of him dying, even though we were talking completely hypothetically and normally I would not have gotten so upset. But I knew it was my hormones calling the shots so I just went with it. I knew it would stop eventually and I was just having a teary day.

I would take the random crying over being incredibly over sensitive and irritable when I'm pms-ing any day. It still sucks but crying to myself is preferable to biting someones head off for seemingly no reason. But I guess I'm just used to it because my hormones go beserk when I'm on my period so I'm entirely at their mercy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a date per say but I had been with an ex for only five weeks and it was my birthday. He was treating me for my whole 'birthday week' and the pinnacle was a home cooked three course meal at my house of anything I wanted. I asked for a full roast chicken dinner (with mushrooms on the side, cause I'm weird)

My ex miscalculated how long it would take to cook a full chicken and everything from scratch and it ended up not being ready until almost midnight that night, and in that time I was forbidden from entering the kitchen. When he did eventually let me in I expected him to have the table set up in the kitchen but instead he had moved the huge heavy table outside into our crappy alleyway of a back garden and completely transformed it. He'd put up a tarp over the table, there was candles everywhere, fairy lights, lanterns, everything. I had no idea a dingy alley could look so beautiful.

We sat eating and drinking wine all night in the beautifully decorated alley and I was so touched by how much effort he had gone to. I knew that night that I had fallen in love with him. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Looking for advice on punctuation, readability and just general opinions on this old story that I've been reworking a bit. All advice appreciated.

**The Voice**

'This isn't right.'

 The voice spoke as I watched my reflection brush my teeth in the mirror. It was so clear, like I had spoken in my own ear, that it stopped my hand in its vigorous movements around my mouth. I glanced at him in the mirror, he was fiddling with his tie in the bedroom; struggling with the knot. Head bent in concentration whistling a snippet of some tune I couldn't place. I spat toothpaste into the sink and shook the thought away.


It hadn't started as a voice at all. It had started- like most things -as a feeling. A very small, barely there, feeling. A niggle. A twinge. A brief pause in an ongoing conversation.
	The night it became a whisper I had been lying in bed beside him. He was on his stomach, facing away, snoring softly. He had been asleep for a good half hour as I lay restless. There was no particular cause -I just wasn't an easy sleeper- unlike him. Eventually I drifted into a half sleep. It was in those almost unconscious moments that the whisper came.

'This isn't right.' It hissed in my ear.

My eyes flashed open as my heart thumped painfully against my ribcage. I was staring at the dark curls at the base of his neck on the pillow next to me. I tried to steady my breathing.
	I rolled onto my back and regarded the ceiling. I loved him, didn't I? We had been together not quite a year and a half. Sure, the honeymoon phase was well over but we were happy, most of the time. And if not happy we were definitely stable. And that's what made us great, we knew our way around each other so well, there was no need for drama. Our relationship was a well oiled machine that glided smoothly from one day to the next. Not like...
	I squeezed my eyes shut against the memories but they came anyway. Before him there had been another. He too had had soft black curls, but his framed a wicked smile and flashing green eyes. The image of him danced in my mind and I felt the hot sting of tears, even after all this time.
A whirlwind of images circled through my mind. His face, smiling, laughing, contorted in pain, shouting. The image of him with tears in his eyes, an indescribable look of loss, pain and longing; the last time he had looked at me. It was burned on my memory. And then he was gone. But he took something from me when he left. He took my passion and my power. From then on I was scared. Scared of what I could feel for someone, the depths I could let love take me to. And so I shut off. For the longest time.
	Until one day quiet, shy, unobtrusive him asked me to go for a drink. And even now I could not say exactly why I said yes. But from a quiet drink grew a quiet attraction. I found myself laughing and smiling again. As the months went on we grew into a relationship. Some time later he uttered the words 'I love you' with such sincerity that I found myself saying them back. There were no fireworks with us, but nor were there fights. We loved and existed side by side, not tangled and intertwined.
	He didn't know about the one before. He had asked once or twice, but respected my returned silence. Sometimes in the early days I would wake in a half fog of sleep and turn to see that black mane of curls on the pillow next to me, and my heart would leap, thinking I was with someone else.


***

The conversation had started innocently enough.

 'Your clothes are everywhere.' He said one morning.

'Yeah I guess they've been building up. I'll take them back to mine at the weekend.' I replied, fiddling with a stiff earring clasp.

'Or they could stay here.' He said. I looked up to see him staring at me.

'What do you mean?' I asked slowly.

'Well, you're here all the time anyway. You're paying rent for a place you never stay. Wouldn't it make sense to just combine our incomes and for you to live here?' That was his way, ever practical.

'I suppose.' I replied and suddenly winced, I had stabbed the fleshy part of my ear with my earring. I cursed and threw the offending bloody implement onto the bed, a small tear drop of blood stained the white sheet.

***

I watched him across the table as he chewed loudly. The voice had transformed itself into a sickly feeling in my stomach; like something slimy and rotting weighing heavy in my intestines.

'Are you happy?' The question was out before I could think about it. He looked up from his plate as if he had forgotten I was there.

'What?' He asked through a half chewed mouthful.

'I mean, are you happy...with us?' I said. He stared at me with a bewildered expression for a moment before swallowing.

'Of course I am. What makes you say that?'

'Nothing. I just...' I didn't know how to put it into words.

'I wouldn't have asked you to move in if I wasn't happy, would I?' He replied cutting through a piece of steak gristle.

'I thought that was just convenience.'

'Well, yeah.' He paused to chew. 'But I want you here, too.' He said simply.

'Okay.'

He went back to concentrating on his plate of food. I wanted him to ask me if I was happy, but I knew he wouldn't. It wasn't his way.


The voice spoke more often now. As I drank my morning cup of coffee. As I did the laundry. When he spoke about his work. When his clammy hand set itself in mine. As we ate and drank and fucked. And as he slept, whilst I lay restless, listening to the voice argue back and forth in my head.

It was a rainy Sunday afternoon. I had pulled my armchair close to the window to watch the rain come down as I read my book. He was sitting on the couch watching a nature program with the volume turned down low as he bounced his leg. Restless leg syndrome he had told me it was called.
	The fire crackled and lit the room in a warm orange glow. It had been my idea to unblock the fireplace and see if we could get it going. I had always loved the idea of an open fire, especially on rainy Sunday afternoons.
	I glanced up to look at him, sitting open mouthed eyes glued to the TV, completely unaware of my presence.
	'This isn't right!' My own voice shouted inside my head. The severity of it made me to slam my book down and shut my eyes against it. When I opened them he was looking at me with surprise.

'What was that?' He asked

'What?'

'You threw your book, nearly gave me a heart attack!' He said incredulously.

'I'm sorry, I'm just...' What could I say? I'm hearing voices?

'Is everything okay with you? You've been a bit... off lately.' A mix of suspicion and concern spread across his face.

Before I knew what was happening I felt tears begin to slide down my face. His one simple question, his gentle nudge of concern was enough to break the fragile barrier I had been trying to hide behind. The full weight, not of what I wanted but of what I didn't want, hit me like a blow to the chest. I didn't want him. I didn't want this. I didn't want any of the life we had been building. I had been pretending. Pretending so well I had convinced myself. Fake it till you make it. I felt like I was going to scream. I heard myself choking back sobs and suddenly he was beside me.

'Jesus, Zoe, what is it? What's wrong?'

He was kneeling beside me, a look of such genuine concern and worry written on his face that I hated myself more than anything in that moment. I couldn't love him. I so badly wanted to.

'This isn't right, Michael. I can't do this anymore.'

The words tumbled out of me as if I was exorcising a demon. I felt like I could breathe again. I looked up to see his eyes filling with tears, his expression contorting in pain and confusion, and I knew it was happening again.

<TEXT> I used to be like that. I always needed some sort of romantic male validation. Even if I wasn't in a relationship I needed a guy to be interested in me. I hated it about myself and took a year off from dating to work on sorting it out.

I don't feel like I need male validation anymore, I'm confident in myself and in the year I took to work on myself I learned that my own sense of validation actually feels much better than any from men. Also it's very freeing to know you don't depend on anyone to make you feel better about yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a problem with this because I like to show love by doing things for an SO, so like keeping the place clean, laundry, cooking, nagging him to take a jacket when it's cold. It almost always backfires because the SO then begins to take it for granted and plays to it and I end up resenting them completely.

In my current relationship I'm trying to find a balance and I think I'm doing okay. I still struggle because I do the majority of the housework, but I do give him a chore list, and then have to remind him to do it which makes me feel motherly and icky.

Basically having to tell me SO to pick up his clothes, wash his dishes and hang up the washing makes me feel uncomfortable for a ton of reasons (mostly feeling like his mother) but my options are tell him to do it or do it myself so I opt for the least resent-inducing option. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think a lot of the time it's a slow and subtle build up of things. You don't realise how unhappy you are because unhappiness has become the norm to you both.

For me there is always a trigger event. It can be something as simple as arguing about why they didn't pick their socks up off the floor but suddenly something will click and I'll find the courage from somewhere to finally admit I am desperately unhappy and that the fear of walking away from the relationship is not enough to keep me in a state of misery.

Breaking up is a horrible, scary, experience but look at your past break ups; weren't you eventually better off for having done it? If you survived it before you can again. Best of luck OP. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd find it flattering. A guy who clearly isn't comfortable trying to chat up women is making the effort for me, that's cute.

Honestly socially awkward shy guys are my thing so I'd probably be very charmed and try to help him along if I felt we had something between us. If I felt there wasn't something there I'd still talk to him and be friendly but I would kindly say no if he asked for a date/my number.

My advice is just take a chance. The more women you talk to the more practice you get and the more chance someone will be interested. You're not going to find someone standing staring at your phone not interacting.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've never slept with someone in a cheating situation but I have kissed other people twice when I was in relationships.

I remember both times I was drunk, upset about my relationship and knew it was nearing the end. Both times happened when the relationship was hanging by a thread and I didn't know what to do. Kissing another person was obviously the worst thing I could do but I think it might have been my drunken subconscious way of making myself leave the relationship because I knew if I cheated I would have to immediately fess up and they would leave me.

Interestingly both partners forgave me when I confessed but the relationship was never the same and it didn't last longer than a few months after that.

Even years later I'm still ashamed of myself for doing it, twice no less, and I hate to think about it. I hate remembering that I hurt two good guys because I was too immature to just break up and walk away. </TEXT>

However she's from my town and I used to see her preform at open mic nights and she was the most obnoxious, up her own bum, teenage asshole ( I honestly can't think of another word to describe her) and her music is sub-par at best.

Now she's being played on all the national radio stations and I just get irrationally furious every time I hear her music. I swear I grit my teeth every time I hear her stupid stage name. She represents a lot of things I strongly dislike.

I really shouldn't let it bother me so much, she's just following her dream and getting recognition, but I can't help the reaction she evokes in me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get where you're coming from. I was always attracted to dramatic relationships and the whirlwind of emotions that go with them, it's kind of addictive to always be on a knife edge romantically. But then I realised I was just causing myself unnecessary pain and that those relationships never worked because they were built on unhealthy dramatic habits and not on a good stable foundation.

For me I ended up going to counselling to get to the root of why I couldn't hold a stable relationship and sorting through my issues. I'm ten months into a great stable relationship now, only one argument so far and we have great communication and I feel very stable within the relationship. I will admit part of me missed the drama at the start but when you realise how destructive that drama can be it makes you want it a whole lot less. </TEXT>

It was my first relationship in over a year after getting over a traumatic relationship.

<TEXT> Hi OP, I'm also 24 with an alcoholic parent. My mum has been an alcoholic for almost 15 years now and has passed through the functioning phase to full blown. She has ended up in hospital many times from injuring herself when drunk, she used to drink drive and a year ago she was put into an induced coma in intensive care and my family and I were pretty much told she wouldn't live due to the damage she'd done to herself, but she's still with us and currently almost nine weeks sober which is a major deal for her.

I'm not explaining all this to scare you of things to come, rather just to let you know that I have been where you have been and have a better relationship with my mum now than I have had for my entire life. Like you I was the only one living at home when my mum was still a functioning alcoholic and, like you, I was the only one that was willing to speak up about her problem. But, as is so common in families of alcoholics, my family also downplayed it and tried to make me out to be the problem, because it is easier that facing up to the fact that everyone is enabling the alcoholic, sometimes it's easier just to live with the elephant in the room.

I really feel for you walking on eggshells and constantly watching your dads behaviour, trying to stop him from harming himself or others when he's drunk. I remember that feeling and by the time I moved out I was destroyed and sick from constantly worrying. It took me years to be able to hear a can of beer being opened without flinching. But honestly moving out is the best thing you can do for yourself. You are not your fathers keeper and his behaviour will continue regardless of your being there. One thing that took me a long time to come to terms with being a child of an alcoholic is that you cannot help someone that is not willing to help themselves.

When I moved out I cut contact with my mum, moved to a different country and didn't speak to her for four years. But all it did was make me bitter, angry and have a lot of unresolved problems. I'm not sure where you live but Al-Anon, a group for family members of alcoholics, is pretty universal and it is a wonderful group that doesn't tell you how to deal with your alcoholic, it's just a place that you can go and talk out your frustrations, worries and problems and people there understand what you're going through and will offer you support.

By using Al-Anon and one to one counselling I dealt with my issues with my mum and now I have learned to 'detatch with love' I can spend time with my mum, appreciate the times she is sober, and let her drink when she does without worrying or judging, even though I know she will die because of her drinking.

Sorry for the rambling post I hope at least some of it helps you. And if you would like to talk more please feel free to pm me. Best of luck with your father. </TEXT>

They were playing their last song and putting their hearts and souls into it as fireworks started to go up and I was there with the man I love and I was just so grateful to be alive and be there.

But the whole experience was ruined quite a bit by the couple we were there with talking through the WHOLE concert including the last song, and the girl in particular has a very annoying high pitched voice that can be heard over everything.

<TEXT> I was in that same kind of situation when I was a student. I stayed in my student town over the SUmmer even though it was very empty and lonely and I had basically no cash.

My way of getting myself out of my own head and back outside for free was to get a book out of the library and just sit outside and read. I'd pack myself a sandwich and some water and just go off and wander and people watch. Even though I wasn't technically socialising I still felt more connected to people because I was just outside around people. And being out and about gives opportunities to start conversations.

Even on rainy days I would go sit in the library and read or write. I got inspired to write a lot of my stories from just people watching around the town. Hope that helps! </TEXT>

As soon as he left he blocked me on all social media and cut me out of his life to make it seem like we never happened. I finally got him to admit that he had never loved me and he didn't know why he had bothered. Four months later he was engaged to his ex. On top of that he hit me twice during our relationship and was quite manipulative and had a fierce temper.

In the end I dodged a bullet but it really was like a living nightmare when it happened. </TEXT>

People always ask me in the Summer what it's about and since it's personal to me I usually just say 'Oh it's a bunch of personal symbols to me, it would take forever to explain.' That usually stops them prying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was bullied in primary school by a girl because I became overweight when my parents were separating. I came from a small town and my parents were the first from there to separate so I got picked on a lot for that.

Fast forward and my bully dropped out of secondary school and was working in McDonalds and she ended up tagging along with the girl that was hired to do my hair and make up for my prom, so she had to help doll me up and watch me go off to my school prom which I felt was a nice karmic revenge. I didn't confront her about the bullying though, I had grown up a lot and let a lot of it go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nope, I usually just roll my eyes when the guy I'm interested in eventually tells me he's a big gamer. I seem to somehow go for guys that count gaming as a big part of their life, it seems to just be one of the side effects of the kind of guys I go for. Every single one of my ex's have been gamers.

The important thing when you're telling a potential partner that you're a gamer is to make sure they know that you're still going to prioritise them over games. I've broken up with ex's in the past because of their obsession with gaming and their prioritising it over our relationship. But now I'm totally fine with gaming being part of my boyfriends life as long as he prioritises our relationships and his responsibilities before it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No way. My boyfriend and I have a healthy sex life but sometimes one of us isn't in the mood or we're apart and we both know that the other will masturbate and we're both totally fine with it.

I think seeing masturbation as infidelity would be quite unhealthy in a relationship, sometimes sex isn't possible/on the cards and I wouldn't want my partner to deny himself just because I'm out of action and I know he feels the same way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes they were for me, so far anyway.

In college I had a great group of friends, I was popular, had different places to go every night. I lived to my fullest. I enjoyed my lectures and course and I lived in a beautiful seaside town where my college was situated.

It was my first time living in a different country and I learned just how independent and capable I am and it was a wonderful experience.

Of course it wasn't all sunshine and happiness, I was beyond poor at times, the stress could be overwhelming, and in my second year I had a nervous break down due to repressing a lot from my past. But I had an amazing group of friends and social life that I'm not likely to have again and I honestly wouldn't change any of it for the world.

I've been out of college for two years now and the real world totally sucks, if I could go back to my college days I'd do it in a heartbeat. </TEXT>

I'm fine with Word, Outlook, Powerpoint but I only have **very** basic Excel skills and I'm freaking out that they're going to question me on Excel and I'm not going to be able to answer.

Does anyone have any advice on what kind of questions they'd be likely to ask so I can formulate answers and avoid staring at them blankly?

<TEXT> I've been where you are. I was with a guy that got a night shift job three months into our relationship and our relationship ended up going the same way as yours. He slept literally all day, would only wake up half an hour before he had to go to work and I ended up feeling completely alone in our relationship.

I wish I could say things got better but in the end up the shift work ended up sucking the life out of him and he had no motivation to change regardless of how much I tried to talk to him about it and we ended up breaking up.

I hope things don't go the same way for you and really all you can do is talk to him about it and try and get him to see it from your point of view and see how it affects you. Maybe he could try looking for work that doesn't involve night shifts? </TEXT>

Any time in the past I've moved in with a bf I end up resenting them for not pulling their weight around the house and my current bf lives in squalor and rarely cleans so definitely seems like an issue.

 But when I think about it objectively: I'm thinking about backing out of moving in because of an untidy house :/ </TEXT>

Personally I'm not one of those people that thinks you have to physically cheat for there to be a problem. If he's flirting heavily or showing intent towards another woman then I'll walk.

For me it's not about overstepping just physical boundaries, it's a matter of trust and if that trust is broken then I would need to weigh up the situation but I'm likely to come out in favour of walking away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just want to say I'm so sorry for your situation, this must have come as a massive shock to you.

Out of curiosity did you ask your husband why he lied to you about this issue for so long and how long has he been sure that he would never want children?

In my opinion what he has done is unspeakably selfish. If he was having any doubts whatsoever over such a serious issue as children he should have brought it up to you as soon as possible and certainly way before you were married.

If he hates children like you say he does surely that's not something that develops overnight and he's felt like this for some time, so was he lying to you about wanting to have children to get you to marry him?

I don't think there is any compromise on a situation like this. If one person wants kids and the other doesn't then it's simply not going to work. Either you will end up resenting him for being childless and your marriage will suffer. Or you will accidentally fall pregnant and he will resent you and the child and your marriage/your child will suffer.  </TEXT>

He completely respected that and the next morning asked if he could go down. Because he was respectful and made it clear he just wanted to please me with no pressure I said yes.

I feel a lot of guys go down early on and then expect sex as a reward. Like 'I licked your pussy, you gotta let me stick my dick in it now.'

I hate that attitude so it needs to be clear a guy is just doing it for what it is and not as a way to pressure me into sex before I'm ready to sleep with them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can kind of see where your bf is coming from because I've experienced something similar. I was with someone and we were so crazy in love that it was actually a crazy relationship. We operated on such a high level of emotion at all times. I've often told my current bf that I'm so grateful for the healthy relationship I have with him now instead but I make sure he knows that that I am totally head over heels for him, but in a good way. My past relationship was horribly dysfunctional because of how much we "loved" each other.

He might be making the comparisons between his previous relationship and his relationship with you because he wants you to know how much happier he is with you, but maybe he's not expressing it right. Just because he's not tearing his hair out watching you sleep doesn't mean he doesn't love you. I don't run around making mad gestures of love at 3am to my current SO but I love him more than I ever loved my crazy ex because what I have now is real love and a real healthy relationship, not a destructive codependency. There are different kinds of love and it sounds like he loves you in a much more fulfilling and healthy way. However if you feel like you're giving 100% of your love and he's only giving 50% it could be because he is consciously reserving himself or it could be, like you suspect, that he hasn't given himself proper time to heal from his previous relationship so he can't give you his all.

I can't tell you how he is actually feeling I just thought I'd try to offer a bit of perspective from someone that's been in a similar situation.  </TEXT>

The one pro I see of not getting married is that if a split was to happen it would be much easier to separate, which to me is the wrong reason to not get married cause it kind of seems like you're keeping one foot out of the relationship just in case. But that's just my personal opinion and I don't think marriage automatically means your relationship is any stronger that anyone else's. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This sounds like the relationship equivalent of a parent finding their kids hiding a pack of cigarettes 'I was just holding them for a friend.'

I've been on Tinder and I met my SO on Tinder so if you're wondering if he's telling the truth what you can do is, when you're with him, ask him to reactivate the account and let you see his account. If he was matching and messaging with girls it will all still be there, when you deactivate the account all that stuff stays until a certain period of time has passed, I presume in case you change your mind and go back to it.

However I would advise you drop this on him on the spot otherwise he could reactivate and go in and manually delete stuff before you can see it. If you've had trust issues in the past and he admits he was in the wrong with this then he should have no reason to not let you see his profile and whatever activity is on it, seems like the most straight forward way to get to the bottom of this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I totally get where you're coming from, I've gone out with two other hardcore gamers previously and the gaming was a definite factor in the break up because I don't game either. I think what makes a difference in this relationship is that my bf is very considerate that his gaming for hours on end might annoy me so he will only game if he asks first if I'd mind or if I pick up a book to read for a while he'll go 'Oh if you're going to read I might game for a bit' and four hours go past. But it makes all the difference that he considers me first before just mindlessly turning to a game.

Another difference I find in this relationship is that my bf may be a big gamer but he's also happy going out and doing things, being away from games for a weekend etc and happy to compromise. Gamers I've gone out with in the past just wanted to switch off and game 24/7 which made me feel unappreciated and ignored which built resentment.

The way I see it my boyfriend is a gamer with his priorities right. He works, walks the dog, does chores and spends time with me and fits his gaming around that, not the other way around.

Maybe talk to your bf about how he prioritizes his gaming? </TEXT>

But it's how he relaxes so it's up to him how he spends his time, as long as he makes time for me it doesn't bother me much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wouldn't say I lose interest, I just lose that 'I can't wait to see them and rip their clothes off' horniness that you have at the start but I think that's natural.

I think one way to keep interest in sex is to keep trying new things. Talk about your fantasies/roleplay/positions you would like to try. Mixing it up keeps it fresh and there's so much out there to be tried and experimented. Then again I'd be a fairly high libido person so I don't ever get fully bored with sex. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on what it is. But I would never demand someone throw something out, no matter who it was from. I have however mentioned things like pictures of ex's be taken down and just this week I found two things my bf's ex had made/painted him whilst I was cleaning so I just left them out and asked him what he wanted to do with them. I wouldn't have had a problem with them expect they were covered in hearts/their initials/their nicknames for each other so it would have been uncomfortable for me to keep them on display. But other than personal things like that it doesn't bother me.

However I have had ex's that were not ok with me wearing an old ex's t-shirt etc, not because I was still attached to them just cause it was comfy. And I had one ex tell me flat out they didn't want to see me wearing anything that had belonged/been given to me by an ex. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I've always kind of ended up accidentally living with SO's pretty early in the relationship.

With one of my ex's he had to move in with me after two weeks of dating due to circumstances but we stayed togehter for two years. But in other relationships it happened after a few months and fell apart pretty quickly so I guess it depends on the relationship.

I currently spend about 5 nights a week at my SO's house because he lives alone and we also live a bit apart so once I'm here I tend to stay for a while. I only really go back to my place when I have to work three days during the week. Although my bf and I are planning on living together soon when I find a job in his city so really this is sort of a trail period for that. </TEXT>

I always keep tampons in by bag in case it should strike at an unexpected moment and if I go up to four months without one I'll take a pregnancy test just to stop that little niggling feeling in the back of my mind.

I've had contraceptive implants, and irregular periods because of them, since I was 16 so I'm kind of used to it now.

If I go a couple of months without a period and then it starts I will get momentarily freaked out and be all 'Oh my god, I'm bleeding, what's wrong with me?!' before remembering that's actually normal! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Same here. My closest friend is female but I'm more comfortable making friends with men. I find men easier to talk to, more straight forward and easier to have a laugh with.

The way it feels to me is it's like my guy friends have one level of communication. When your chatting with a guy what they say is what they mean and a joke is a joke.

But I feel that with female friends there can be two levels of a conversation: what they're saying and what they're implying. There's always seems to be an undertone of competition or of chalking their life against yours etc. The only person I don't feel this with is my best friend, which is probably why she is.

I'm not sure why I think like this, maybe it's because I went to all girls school or just had bad relationships with girls when I was younger but simply I'm more at ease around guys. </TEXT>

One was lovely, didn't make a fuss and shared their vegan food with the rest of the household.

The other was a former close friend of mine and became vegan when she saw one for her friends had turned vegan and lost loads of weight, so she decided to try it too. She proceeded to become hugely annoying, harping on about her vegan-ism and threw a hissy fit because "her" plate had been used for a bacon sandwich.

In my opinion people like that give vegan-ism a bad name. I'm all for each to their own but firstly she did it for no other reason than as a diet and then morphed into a self-righteous pain in the ass. Not cool. </TEXT>

But I've been in that place where you're compulsively checking their page and every picture of them out enjoying themselves whilst you cry alone with a 6ft bar of chocolate is like a dagger to the heart. My advice is to unfriend them. Seems harsh and you don't wanna make them think you're being pissy but what I've found is if you message them just saying it's nothing personal but you think a bit of virtual space is what you need right now they'll usually reply with 'okay cool.' and you'll feel like an eejit but once you don't have the opportunity to constantly check it does make it easier to go five minutes without thinking about them. </TEXT>

But recently I've realised I like cleaning his house as a sign of appreciation. He works all day and I don't work much so when I'm at his and he's at work I like to clean up and make the place as nice and tidy as possible for when he comes home.

But I'm starting to realise he doesn't care how the place looks, so although he'll give a small acknowledgment that it's clean it doesn't really matter to him, which I guess irks me a bit. But really it's my problem. It's just not how he wants to be shown appreciation and it's kind of my default. Also I really like a clean and tidy house and he will happily live in mess so really maybe it's not all for his sake...

He looked great on paper, big house, nice car, good job, clean freak etc but after a few months I realised that was as far as he wanted to go in life. The biggest change he foresaw in his future was maybe moving to a bigger city for a higher paying job. Whereas I have no idea what I want to do with my life, I want to travel and move around etc so it just wasn't working.

Now I'm with someone that has a stable life but wants more similar things to me in the future and is willing to mix and match to gel our futures and I'm much happier. </TEXT>

I've learned to be pretty thrifty and seriously reassess my priorities. for example I buy a new item of clothing/shoes once in a blue moon because it's not important. But second hand shops are a life saver if you are someone that likes to shop but you're on a budget.

Pound shops/dollar stores are great for household stuff like toilet paper/detergent/etc, they're not fancy but they do nicely.

Meals like pasta bakes and curry are cheap to make and will last a few days to save on food shopping. Also really shop around to find the best deals.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay firstly take a look at the language you use to describe her and your situation:

> getting upset over all sorts of nonsense.
>the poor girl
And your title saying 'getting upset over stupid things'

If you are addressing this issue with her using this kind of language you are going to get nowhere. It might seem to you that she is over reacting and these issues aren't important to you but they are to her therefore you shouldn't belittle them and you should have an open and respectful talk with your girlfriend and explain that, although you love her very much, you feel you just need a little more time to yourself. Make sure she understands that space does not mean you feel any less for her and it may even improve your relationship because you can then appreciate the time you do spend together.

But honestly if my boyfriend described me in the way you talk about you gf I'd be horrified, it sounds like you pity her more than anything and that's not a sing of a healthy relationship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love sex and have recently discovered I'm into BDSM but I haven't had a one night stand or casual hook up in about three years. I realised I just didn't enjoy them and felt worse about myself after so I stopped.

When I'm single I guess I do find it difficult for the first few months but after a while I just kind of forget about sex. I guess I'm lucky because when I'm in a relationship I love to have sex but when I'm single I'm so not into one night stands that I just know it's not an option and I just forget about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you're actually enabling her. I'm not saying this is your fault, you love her and it's very selfless of you to take on a second job to support you both so that she can focus on school but when you look at it objectively she is a twenty eight year old woman who cannot stand on her own two feet.

A lot of people don't go for further education because the can't afford it/can't dedicate the time to it, your girlfriend should have thought about this at the start of her studies too. What about the option of part time study? It will take her a year or two more but it will cut her work load in half so she would have no excuse not to work.

Basically it sounds like you're beginning to resent her, which I think is justified, but it will totally destroy your relationship if you don't address it. Instead of sighing and saying nothing when she lets you down why don't you try talking to her about it and explaining how it makes you feel. She can't make an effort to change if she doesn't know what's wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you have both had some serious doubts about the relationship and honestly it sounds like you've already made up your mind.

> I don't really think I want to be with her for the rest of my life anymore.

It's sad that you've lost the love you once had but you need to really think if there are practical things you can do to get the love back, such as a serious heart to heart about how you're feeling, trying to spend more quality time together and putting more effort in from both sides. But if your feelings don't change it might be time to face that maybe your relationship has just run it's course and it's better for you both to go your own ways and have the opportunity to find new love rather than stay together out of obligation.

He has hot girls/bewbs as his background on his PC and I don't care, in fact I don't notice it anymore so I'm certainly not going to mind that he has porn on his PC. He needs something to look at when I'm not there. </TEXT>

I am not the most photogenic of people and I have sent my bf the occassional nude when he's asked for them but honestly I only do it because he asks and really the pics just depress me, because even though I know my boyfriend loves me and how I look, I do not think I look sexy in these pictures and it makes me feel crappy.

If she's not okay with sending you pics -which you should just accept because she doesn't owe you anything and sending nudes should not be what your relationship hinges on- how about phone sex. That way you can get off listening to her but she doesn't have to send you any files etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am guilty of being self centered when I talk to my bf. It's not a conscious thing I just like to tell him all the things going on and what I've been thinking etc but a relationship is give and take and I of course take an interest in the things he tells me about his work his interests etc and I find them genuinely interesting even if I don't understand them. When I feel I'm talking too much about myself and my things I make sure to ask him what's going on with him.

Firstly I think you should have a direct talk with him about it and how it makes you feel, by the sounds of it it sounds like it's just habit to him now and he doesn't even realise he's being selfish and making you feel this way.

If that doesn't work, and I'm sure this is going to seem like a controversial tack to some people, try responding to him in the same way as he does to you about his interests and the things he talks to you about. I know this seems petty but in the past I've had issues with ex's where I would talk to them about something they were doing that was upsetting me etc, and they couldn't see it from my point of view and didn't see what they were doing wrong. So for a week or two I'd mirror their behavior to me and lo and behold suddenly they twigged because they were getting a taste of how I felt.

Obviously try to have an honest and open discussion with him about this first and I hope that works but if not maybe the mirroring behavior might be worth a shot. It's not guaranteed to work but it's helped me with a few issues in the past. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have cheated in two different relationships (both times just a kiss but still cheating) I have also been cheated on twice in two different relationships. It's a horrible thing to do and I'm still deeply ashamed of myself for having done it and I've also been on the receiving end and it's an awful feeling.

When I started going out with my current bf he was honest with me and told me that in three short previous relationships when he was younger he had cheated on each one of them but he promised me he was past that time and would never do it to me.

Although he reassured me it was hard to get past because I had been cheated on before and I didn't want to take that chance again, but then I realised that I have also cheated in the past but I am a different person now and would never put someone through that again, so I had to believe the same of my bf.

People make stupid mistakes at different points in their life for different reasons, it's no excuse but the important thing is to learn from it. You bf has been up front and told you the truth, it's up to you now if you choose to take him at his word and believe him. If you do, good for you, relationships are always a risk and you don't know until you try. But if you can't move past it and harbor this mistrust deep down then it will cause a problem in your relationship. Best of luck! </TEXT>

Many times I've found my stuff already put in the dryer and started and honestly I think it's fine, my housemates need to do their washing too and if I had stuff in there that can't be machine dried then it's up to me to set a timer and get it out as soon as the wash has finished.

I also used to live in an appt complex with shared washing facilities and yes it would feel a little weird that someone had handled my dedicates to put them in the dryer but again if I didn't move them in time then I think it's fair game that someone else did so that they can do their washing. </TEXT>

The idea of having kids worries me because kids now seem so tuned into technology so early on and are wrapped in cotton wool, never allowed out of sight or to attempt to do things for themselves. I'd like to think I'd do things differently but a lot of the time it seems to be the pressure of society that forces you to raise your child a certain way, no one wants their child to be the odd one out or shunned for how they're brought up.

It's a tough one and I don't look forward to having to figure out how to be a parent or what kind I'm going to be but hopefully that's a few years away from me yet. </TEXT>

But if you've pointed it out numerous times, told him you find it inconsiderate and hurtful and he says the stuff doesn't mean anything to him then there is absolutely no reason why he shouldn't have gotten rid of it by now, and it definitely should not still be everywhere you look.

If he wants to hang onto memento's then ask him if he would please keep them in a box/all in one place but mostly *out of sight*.

If he can't do this or is defensive or continues to ignore your request then I would definitely be worried that he may still have feelings for his ex if he's willing to risk his relationship with you just to keep her stuff around.

<TEXT> Technically you have done nothing wrong, you weren't exclusive when you slept with you ex, no big deal. However, you didn't tell her this for three months. I get that it was probably because you didn't see it as a big deal or whatever but you should probably have let her know this before you became exclusive.

Regardless of whether she see's this as cheating, which personally I wouldn't, the lack of trust is probably coming from the fact that you kept it from her and now it has planted the seed of what else might you be keeping from her.

I'm going to take a stab and say she's probably thinking something along the lines that you still wanted your ex, and had her, when you were (non-exclusively) seeing her already, so maybe you want other girls too and now she's afraid to trust you. It's not a healthy way to think at all but that's what it sounds like.

However if she can't get over the fact that this blip occurred with you ex and is now seeing to control your friendships/movement this is a big no-no. No one has the right to control anyone else no matter what. Either your girlfriend deals properly with this issue or I would advise that you walk because she is going to keep tightening that leash otherwise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Relationships are not math problems and they don't hinge on absolute equality. You say an unequal relationship leads to problems, well I hate to break it to you but your strictly equal relationship is now causing you problems.

Suck it up and agree to put in a few extra hours if it's that important. Your wife is stuck in the house day in day out and now she is pursuing something worthwhile that is bringing in money. Please stop belittling her passion as equal to swimming. You're not creating and using a variety of mental skills when you swim, you're doing laps, not the same thing! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My boyfriend and I recently had our first fight about this.

We live about 40 mins apart and neither of us drive so we depend on buses. He works full time, has a dog to look after and has a house to himself. I work three days a week and have a room in a shared house, so it makes sense that I would mostly travel to see him.

However, after 6 months of spending up to five nights a week at his I was starting to get resentful because I was completely neglecting my life in my city and much needed alone time.

I explained this to my SO and asked if we could cut seeing each other back to weekends. We're only a week into this new plan but already I'm happier because I'm spending more time doing what I want and I actually have a chance to miss my SO and I'm looking forward to seeing him.

The way I look at it, just because you *can* spend all your time together doesn't necessarily mean that you *should*. </TEXT>

So far I haven't met any past or present SO in a bookshop or in a situation involving books. I've met SO's in bars, through friends, online, but as of yet I've never had a romantic interaction in a bookshop. Young me would probably be disappointed by this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think being in a relationship can force you out of your comfort zone, it can widen your view point as an SO might have wildly different views than you on something and you come to see that thing differently because of them. It also teaches you to compromise, which I think is a big thing.

You learn if you're the jealous type, the clingy type, the standoffish type, how you cope with conflict and compromise and you explore who you are both emotionally and sexually.

I'm sure there are many of these things you can learn outside the bounds of a relationship but I don't think you can learn what kind of person you are in a relationship without actually being in a relationship.  </TEXT>

If he says it's not a big deal and knows it upsets you then he shouldn't still be persisting in doing it. His idea of boundaries may be different than yours but the important thing is to compromise on them and make sure you are both certain about what is acceptable and unacceptable.

I enjoy not having any secrets because I'm a huge believer in honesty is the best policy, but I guess that's not really relevant when it comes to discussing previous partners etc because that has no bearing on your present relationship.

My SO and I are extremely honest with each other about past present and future and I enjoy that because it brings us closer. But if you don't want to tell your partner about your past and he doesn't ask then I guess there's no harm. Just be careful he wouldn't hear in passing about something from your past and then feel like you had been hiding it from him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you are deeply insecure and have issues with yourself then you're not going to be able to believe you are good enough for any relationship, not just this one.

I have been where you are myself and I chose to get therapy for my issues and it has helped me so much. It doesn't magically fix all your issues and make you feel wonderful about yourself but it gives you the tools to deal with your insecurities in a logical manner. It's not easy to start with and it takes a lot of practice but it will make a world of difference to your future relationships.

I can't tell you if taking a break/breaking up is the right thing to do. I was in a fairly new relationship when I began my therapy and it didn't work out but I can't say for definite that was because of my therapy. All I know is that you have to make yourself a priority for it to work. I hope you get the help you need. </TEXT>

This is a seriously bad view point and if she is withholding physical contact, especially after such a long period of time, then a ring isn't going to make things better.

As others have said she either has to accept it and get over it or it's not going to work out but to be honest if she hasn't let go of it by now it doesn't look promising for your future. If there is a way to determine that it was definitely you that gave her the infection then I'd suggest that but if not this is something she either needs to come to terms with or risk losing your relationship. </TEXT>

When my SO began to hint that he had an interest in it I told him I was willing to try it we both began to discover it together and it turns out we both love it.

He has always had an interest in it but not had a chance to really explore it in his previous relationship and I had never really thought that much into it or had the confidence to explore it before being with him but it turns out it's definitely my thing.

I think what makes it great is that we're trying most of it for the first time together and figuring out what exactly we like and how we like it and discussing it together which makes our relationship better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you already know the answer to your own question. You say you were happier with the person you were before you were with him and you dislike yourself now. If something isn't making you happy then it's better to let it go, otherwise you risk resenting your boyfriend for your dislike of yourself because you changed for him (regardless of if he wanted you to or not)

Breaking up is always scary, especially when you're young and in college with so much going on and changing but it sounds to me like it's what you need and what you deep down want. You deserve to be happy in yourself and do the things you enjoy, and you will meet someone who enjoys and appreciates that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like he was avoiding talking about the original issue, only asking why it was bothering you when it was hindering sex etc. Now he is choosing to focus on you keeping him awake and disrupting his work and trying to pass the blame on to you so as to avoid dealing with the original issue.

If I was in your situation I would apologise for the late night outburst and for it affecting his work, but he also needs to apologise for shouting at you. There are other ways he could have told you he wasn't ready to discuss it. But if I were you I would agree for you both to take your share of the blame for the night time argument and the subsequent fall out and actually get back to focusing on the  original issue, otherwise you risk falling into a 'my fault/your fault' scenario which will get you nowhere. </TEXT>

I especially feel it with my SO because we have trips and gigs planned that I actually lie awake at night worrying about how I'm going to pay for my side of it. I feel guilty that if I tell him I can't afford it it means we're missing out or he'll try to pay for it all which makes me feel terrible.

I'd try to be understanding and gentle in telling them that I don't feel the same in the kindest way possible whilst still letting them know there is no hope.

<TEXT> My parents separated when I was nine. My dad waited about a year to introduce me to his partner who is now my step-mum.

My mum began seeing a guy and he was introduced quite quickly and became a big part of my life, when they broke up the first time I was devastated and the ex-bf contacted me to tell me how sorry he was etc and this was really upsetting. Also I saw it as being manipulative later in life because he was trying to get my mum back through me.

My mum developed a drinking problem as I was growing up and there were quite a few men in my house that I would be introduced to at the breakfast table. Honestly all I really felt was disgust at my mum and I didn't even acknowledge the men.

I don't feel these encounters left any long lasting damage. It certainly wasn't pleasant but I didn't grow up to be promiscuous or have a negative view of relationships because of it. However I was about 12/13 when this started happening so I can't say how this would affect a 5 year old. </TEXT>

Basically it would happen because we'd be arguing on the couch and I would give up and go to bed and he would choose to stay on the couch because we were both mad and didn't want to be near each other until we calmed down.

<TEXT> Almost all my boyfriends have been shy/quiet guys, it's kind of my type.

Although a lot of them were quiet around groups of people they did open up and talk when it was just us one on one which was important to me.

I have dated one or two guys that were quiet pretty much all the time and that ended up grating on me because I like to talk a lot and have discussions and it began to feel one sided and like they weren't interested.

I honestly never really minded that my shy SO's weren't good at talking to my friends/at occasions as long as they could talk to me but now I'm dating a guy who is quite talkative and confident and it does take the pressure off in social situation to feel like I don't constantly have to be talking to him or prompting him to join conversations. </TEXT>

Something along the lines of 'I'm really sorry but I'm just a little nervous because I like you so much and it's putting me off a little.' That way you're being honest and flattering her at the same time.

 You deserve so much better than that and you deserve someone that not only wants to spend time with you but is excited to and doesn't treat you as second best to a game.

 It's basically plain pasta dishes, or some kind of meat/fish and potatoes.

<TEXT> I started on an antidepressant when I was in a previous relationship and my boyfriend at the time also felt that I was starting to drift away from him and that the pills were changing me, and in fact they were, but not in the way he perceived.

I had been very low and once I started on the pills I began to get stronger again and became more independent again which to him felt like I was pulling away from him because he had become used to me relying on him.

My sex drive also decreased but I managed to regain it after a few months, not back to where it had been but enough to have a fulfilling sex life for both of us.

Your girlfriend is going through a period of adjustment and so is your relationship because of this. Starting antidepressants can be an emotional rollercoaster so I would advise you to be sensitive to her needs and wants for a few weeks and don't put pressure on her about the sex thing, it is out of her control and constantly questioning it will make her feel guilty.

I hope you can come to see that your girlfriend has taken a positive step for herself and, in time, for your relationship. My previous SO refused to see it like this and it turned me away from him that he wasn't supportive of my actions to make myself better.

Talk to your girlfriend and try to understand it from her point of view. In my experience this is only temporary and once she has adjusted you can look forward to a happier girlfriend.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds to me like the OP is saying it's not just about dishes. It's about the fact that he knows that keeping the kitchen clean is important to her yet he still doesn't do anything about it. To me, and it seems also to the OP, this is an red flag and a possible indicator of things to come.

If OP's partner refuses to take equal responsibility for his share of the mess and look after himself instead of expecting her to then what does that spell further down the line? Cleaning up after yourself and doing dishes is a very basic skill that most people learn at an early age, if he can't or won't do this and expects her to then I think that would be cause for concern for anyone in a relationship, considering she has broached the subject with him repeatedly, explained how important it is, and he has not changed his behavior in any way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't beat yourself up about what you did and didn't do, I'm pretty sure everyone looks back on their first relationship and realises how oblivious they were.

It's not unusual that you rushed in with the 'i love you'. First relationships are awesome cause you get so caught up in how great it feels and you don't have anything to compare it to so it's natural to just go full throttle with what you feel and have a deep need to please the person.

From a female perspective, getting into the habit of being a guy that's good at communicating in a relationship is going to be a big plus for you. Women really appreciate guys that can communicate if there's a problem and are willing to listen to their concerns as well.

In the end just be yourself, you'll learn something different from each relationship but trying to be exactly what a woman wants and trying to people please everyone is not going to make yourself happy. Maybe focus on making you happy first, then fit other people around that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a bit of a sore spot for me right now. I'm only 23 and marriage is forever away but I've recently realised how messed up my views on marriage and kids are.

I guess I learned from my parents relationship mostly, and a little from my sisters previous relationship.

I am convinced marriage is akin to a death sentence. My dad left my mum and it triggered her long descent into alcoholism which meant I was brought up in a nightmare situation. Therefore I'm convinced history could repeat itself and I'm absolutely terrified of it.

 I realise logically that this is unlikely and it's only my fear of my parents relationship that makes me think this but I've realised recently how much I believe it and I worry how I'm going to get past it in the future. </TEXT>

When I was younger it was a few moans right before I'd orgasm and now it's difficult to shut me up from beginning to end.

I think it's because I'm more confident now, being able to express what I'm feeling makes it feel better, plus the sex has gotten better so there's more to shout about.

<TEXT> First off, I just wanna say fair play to you for deciding to take the leap to see your doc about it, it's scary and it's a big step. I can only tell you what I know from my own experience which is this:

I started on citalopram almost three years ago. Seeking advice about an anti-depressant was the last resort for me, my family massively frowned on it but I was in college at the time and had suffered a breakdown and was suicidal.

When I finally mustered the courage to go to the doc I broke down and told them that if they didn't find me a therapist and put me on something I wasn't sure I'd make it. Firstly the doc did a risk assessment which is asking you roughly ten questions to determine how much of a risk you are to yourself and others (apparently if I had gotten one point higher they would have been forced to commit me) and then they discuss your options with you and try to find the best tablet for you. I was started on a 10mg dose for two weeks then upped to 20mg.

The doc warned I may feel sleepy and drowsy for the first while but when I took it I was wide awake and giddy, I didn't sleep for a whole night. It takes some time to get used to and I was very up and down but mostly alert. Sometimes I was horribly anxious and couldn't be left alone and other times I was on a complete high and wildly impulsive, it's different for everyone. I'd say it took me about three months to completely settle into them and actually feel optimistic when I woke up in the morning.

Some side effects I found in my case was pretty rapid weight gain, excessive sweating which hasn't eased much over the years and decreased libido and ability to orgasm. Also I'd strongly recommend not drinking any alcohol till you settle onto them.

The one thing I will say is that they're not a quick fix and they won't make your problems go away. I started them because I was desperate and I still continued to slump into depression every few months until I got proper therapy and only since then have I been able to successfully avoid it getting the better of me. The tablets help but you need to do the work yourself for the long term, in my opinion.

I wish you the best of luck with it and hope you get the help you need, whatever it may be, to feel better.

It's not something I'm totally comfortable with but it's not a huge deal for me either. I'm fine with him doing it I just don't want to know what he's commenting to these girls because it would make me insecure. But I trust him 100% and know that he's just doing it for a release. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh hells yay!

I like introverted/shy/socially awkward guys. Always have, no idea why.

I would say I'm an outgoing introvert, if that makes sense. I can seem like the life and soul of the party but I like a lot of time to myself and I like to be silent a lot (usually with my head stuck in a book)

I think I prefer introverts because it suits my true personality and not the one I tend to portray in public. Also I just find it more of a challenge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mostly I just want to be listened to and given sympathy. If I want advice I'll usually ask for input.

I think it's in guys nature to seek answers to problems whereas women, a lot of the time, know what they want to do about a situation but just want to vent about it.

Ask questions and have an interest but don't always have the aim of fixing the situation as that can be frustrating. </TEXT>

Basically if I feel I'm getting attached to the person and I'd be upset to see them out with someone else then I know it's time to put my cards on the table. 10/10 times they've wanted to make it official too but I've always gone into it prepared for them to say they don't want an official relationship, in which case I would walk away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cried happy tears just this weekend past.

I'd told my boyfriend that I didn't want us buying things for Valentines but he turned up at my door with a gigantic bouquet of flowers. When I went to put the flowers in water he put a book on my bed, it was a beautifully illustrated copy of Oscar Wilde's 'The Nightingale and the Rose and other Childrens Stories'. And I burst into tears when I saw it.

The reason being that a few months earlier I had told him that my dad had bought me that book just after he had left us and I was sick at the time. I used to lie in bed and read it over and over. I especially loved the story of The Nightingale and the Rose. But I had lost my copy when I had been going out with a guy and had lent it to him, the relationship came to an unkind, abrupt, end and I never got my book back.

I was so blown away that my boyfriend had remembered about it because we were drunk when I told him and he usually can't remember what day of the week it is, nevermind something like that. I love my new copy and it makes me smile every time I look at it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My current SO is still friends with his ex. They were together for seven years and have been broken up less than a year. It caused me a lot of anxiety at the start of the relationship and we butted heads a bit about it but had a bit of a break through when I asked him 'What are you getting out of staying friends with her? why do you need it?' this stumped him for a while and he admitted he didn't know. He has a lot less contact with her now and I've asked to know more about her as it makes me feel more comfortable.

Everyone wants to be there for people that they care for, if your gf doesn't have frequent contact with this guy then I would see it as her just calling in on a friend that has gone through an ordeal, and it shows she's a caring person. At the same time I can understand why you feel uncomfortable. Perhaps ask her to explain her reasoning behind it so that you can better understand it and become more comfortable about it. It's not unreasonable for you to be uncomfortable about it, it's just natural to feel a little threatened by an SO's ex, even if you know cheating wouldn't occur.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My "one that got away" didn't really get away but for some reason I think of it like that.

We were together for 2 and a half years and kept coming back to each other even though I moved to a different country. We tried and tried to make it work but in the end we just had an unhealthy relationship. We operated on such a high level of emotion at all times it was just impossible to sustain, but it never stopped me from wanting it to work.

I think I see it as the one that got away because we never resolved it and never got closure and it still annoys me that I could never figure out how to make it work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup, it was my biggest fear in my relationships and I used to push people away to make them leave so I could say 'Ha, I knew they'd leave.' (f*cked up, I know)

Then I fell hard for a guy, he moved countries to be with me and after a few weeks just left me with no explanation and absolutely no warning. Totally shattered me for a long time. But then I realised my worst fear had happened and I survived it, and it was probably the best thing that could've happened to me tbh. It made me stronger and actually helped my attitude to relationships (after a long while)

I still get scared my current SO will leave me sometimes but I know now that I can survive it happening and if he does then he's clearly not the person I'm meant to be with. </TEXT>

If you're both seeking sex outside the relationship on a regular basis and not having sex with each other this is going to spiral downwards until one of you develops feelings for another sexual partner and it'll lead to a break up.

But she made a good point, she said:

'Yeah it's fun at the time, but you have someone that makes sitting in fun, and at the end of the night you have someone you can cuddle up to in bed and fall asleep with, and that's the best thing'

<TEXT> I was 11 and got the idea from a pre-teen magazine of all places.

My mother was in the early stages of alcoholism at the time and I didn't understand what was happening and I had no one to turn to, all I knew was that I was scared, in a constant state of anxiety and couldn't control anything.

I was reading a magazine called Girl Talk (I don't think it's still running) one weekend and came across an article about a girl who used to self harm and how she recovered and regretted it. But all that sunk in for me was that she had felt lost and out of control and cutting herself helped her to feel better and in control, and that's exactly what I felt I needed.

A few days later I began cutting myself and it sparked off a six year addiciton to self harm in which I tried to kill myself three times. Overcoming that addiction was one of the hardest things I've ever done and I wish to god I'd never seen that article.

I understand peoples want to raise awarenss of the situation but I think it should be very carfully portrayed as a vulnerable young person, like I was, could see it and believe it's the answer for them. </TEXT>

 I suggest you both take a half hour when you come home from work, before either of you sit down and get comfortable, and clean up. That way you get to sit down after it's done and know that it's done for the day. Maybe divide the chores and alternate who does what every other day so that it's fair on both of you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This happens me occasionally too. I think it has a lot to do with falling hard so fast for someone, you tend to rush through everything because you're so in love and the feelings are so strong and amazing. But that can't be maintained forever and when it heats up so quickly it's bound to cool off just as quick.

I don't see it as meaning that the feelings aren't there, they're just settling into a more normal place. No relationship can be fireworks and roses all the time and when the honeymoon period starts to dwindle I see it as just my feelings cooling to settle into the long term.

I'd advise to stick with it and see if your feelings are just there on a lesser scale rather than gone altogether, but if you really feel nothing after another month maybe it's time to move on and take it slower in the next relationship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been in this situation to a lesser degree but what is the same is the dependency on your boyfriend for your emotional well being. I know it feels like it helps to be around on him and lean on him for support but you are doing yourself more damage. You cannot control someone else's emotions or behaviour so when he reacts in a way that you don't want (like wanting distance) it will set you off again because you rely on him to be your rock.

I know you may not want to hear it but I think your bf is doing the sensible thing for himself talking time to sort himself out because if he also has mental health issues it's important for both of you to protect yourselves from each others issues and not let it jeopardize your own state of mind.

I can completely relate to you feeling abandoned but this is where you need professional therapy to realise that you need to take responsibility for your own state of mind and you need to be your own best support in these situations. It won't happen overnight but it will happen over time if you stick at it and you will feel so much better to be able to rely on yourself.

I know what it's like to completely depend on someone for emotional support when dealing with anxiety and depression and I can tell you from experience that it will take a serious toll on your relationship, which it sounds like it's already doing. No one can be anyone's full support and putting that responsibility on someone else is dangerous.

I know it feels like he's abandoning you for a month but I suggest you should look on this month as time to really work on yourself, get professional help to help yourself, and I promise you it will make your relationship so much better when you can feel in control of your own emotions and not need to lean on your bf all the time. I hope this helps and I really hope things get better for you. </TEXT>

If you don't love yourself you will always rely on the other person to validate you and you will rely on them for the love you can't give yourself which takes it's toll on the other person.

Best thing that ever happened me was having my heart totally broken and realizing I relied on other people to love me because I didn't love myself. Took a year off from dating and relationships, focused on myself, and my relationships are a lot different now because I don't *need* someone else to love me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I find when I have a serious issue that I need to talk to my SO about I tend to clam up for a few days. I usually wait until we're a few drinks in at the weekend, take a deep breath and tell him whats up. But if that's not an option I usually wait until we're sitting together and just say 'I need to talk to you about something.'

I know he'll be willing to listen and resolve it but I have trouble being the one who opens the can of worms. I don't like to seem like I'm criticizing him and he has a bad habit of burying his head in the sand when he thinks something is wrong so it makes it twice as difficult to broach the subject. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in a LDR and had an idea of what I would do for his birthday that would have been time consuming but cost little money (we broke up before his birthday so didn't actually get to do it) but here's my idea.

If you have quite a few photos of both of you together and a song that is special to your relationship it's quite easy to download an editing program and make a little video of you holding up the pictures, little notes etc with your song in the background. It will remind your SO of all the good times you've had, it'll show how much you care to go to the effort of making it and it's something they can watch again and again when they miss you.

And I know it sounds like a super cheesy idea but hey, it's Valentines day! </TEXT>

One of the best tips that helped me was that everyone is just as self conscious as you.

 You think people are focused on how you're coming across? Nope. Chances are they're far too busy concentrating on how they're coming across to notice you stumbled over your words.

People are naturally self centered and we're all seeking approval and acceptance, be kind to yourself and others, we're all doing our best. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No. Love is an important part of a relationship but it can only work when there is trust, honesty, and respect as well as love. It doesn't sound like this is true in either of the relationships you mentioned.

I have been in a sort of similar relationship although nowhere near abusive which is what it sounds like in your post. I stayed with a guy for a long time who was unreliable, unstable and drank way too much. He wasn't a bad guy in any particular way but I made myself miserable staying with him because I loved him madly.

What I learned for that is that love isn't everything and to maintain healthy love you need a healthy relationship. </TEXT>

It would depend a lot on if the person wanted to stop. I would do my best to help, be there to listen, and urge them to get professional help but I would also be wary as I'm still working through my own stuff and would be scared I'd risk that trying to help someone else.

 I once liked a close male friend for a really long time but never had the guts to tell him. I can see looking back now it was mutual but we were both too scared. He's been with a girl for three years now and we lost contact, I have always regretted not telling him.

My advice is go for it. It doesn't need to be dramatic. Meet for a coffee, act confident and just tell him like it's no big deal. That way, if he blows you off you haven't made a big thing out of it and you can save face and your friendship.

If he then tried to hit on me via text I would probably just cut contact. If someone is only interested because they want to get with you then that's not going to work out and I think it would only cause complications in the relationship. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can be super insecure and it's something that you have to constantly work on.

Be it physical or emotional insecurity you just have to constantly remind yourself that your SO is with YOU. They chose to be with you and if they wanted to be with someone else they would be, but they're not because they want YOU.

One of the best things that helped me overcome a lot of my insecurities was when I found out a boyfriend at the time actually loved all the things I didn't like about myself, from my love handles to my over thinking everything.

Talk to your SO and see what he thinks of your insecurities, it really helps to see it through the eyes of someone that loves you and can help you to see yourself in a positive light. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was unlucky enough to have a constant period for four months some years back due to birth control so me and my ex got pretty comfortable with period sex, got it down to a fine art in the end up, this is how we did it:

Condom on him for less to clean, me on top and wail away until we're both satisfied. Since he didn't want to see the mess I'd throw a pillow over his face, hop off and get rid of the evidence with some baby wipes and boom, all done.

I think period sex can be amazing sometimes because I get hornier and my orgasms feel better and I feel more satisfied. </TEXT>

I made my best friend promise to not tell anyone, moments later she asks to borrow my phone to text her boyfriend. She texts her boyfriend saying 'Oh my god flibgiblet and her bf finally did it, but don't tell anyone.' However she didn't know how to use my phone and accidentally sent the message to my older, quite strict, sister.

Naturally I freaked out and my friend apologized profusely. Luckily my sister was cool about it and didn't bring it up until it was fairly common knowledge I was having sex. Could have been a whole lot worse though! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I tend to ask my SO quite a bit about his previous relationship because he was with her for 7 years and they split amicably which is a concept I find hard to get my head around. Also I'm adjusting to the fact that he's still friends with her and he still lives in the house they had together so I find it helps sometimes to know more about her.

That said, he will mention her a lot and sometimes it hurts when he tells me about romantic things he did for her on valentines etc. He doesn't do it to be mean, he's just telling a story, but I don't think anyone likes to think about the person they love being madly in love and romantic with someone else. </TEXT>

Lucky for me so was he, it turns out he had never had any intention of just looking for a rebound (I just weirdly convinced myself of that) and he asked me to be official the day after I got back from my holiday.

He's told me before that he knew he wanted to be with me the night we met but he wanted to play it cool, which I think is super cute :) </TEXT>

The fallout of a bad relationship can leave you with baggage that you inadvertently bring into a new relationship and that can cause problems. However if you have no experience you're a clean slate and free to enjoy a relationship without any thing from the past getting in your way.

Man, I wish I could go back to having zero experience and just enjoying the highs and lows of a relationship without dragging all my past crap with me. Count yourself lucky dude! </TEXT>

Think my favourite episode of the two series' so far would have to be the third episode of the first series, the one about the chips implanted behind peoples ears that can record everything they see and do. I just found it so fascinating as to how that could impact on a relationship and the repercussions.

I can't wait for the Black Mirror Christmas special next week! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My SO and I text pretty much constantly through out the day as we live a bit of a distance apart, there will be lulls when we're both busy at work but other than that it's usually replies within five minutes.

But twice now he's stopped texting completely when he's out drinking and it drives me nuts. The first time was when he went out drinking with his ex gf and I was not happy about the complete lack of communication when he was with her, which I talked to him about afterwards.

Same thing happened last night, he was being quiet through text all day and then stopped responding completely until he got home at 4am. He said his phone was messing up but I'm 99% sure he turned it off on purpose. Not. Cool.

So I actually find it worse that he texts me constantly pretty much all the time but will go radio silence when he's drinking, if he'd simply send a text saying he wants peace to drink with his friends I'd be cool with it, but cutting communication and then possibly lying about it is waaay worse.

Sorry, rant over! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I completely get where you're coming from and I do tend to do the same. If my mood isn't good I can definitely be extra sensitive to things he says/does which I know isn't fair.

I have actually been seeing a counsellor this year as well for these issues and others from my past but unfortunately I couldn't afford any more sessions before I was able to fully address my issues with relationships. However I did learn how to cope with some situations and it definitely helped, I actually used to be a lot more irrational in relationships in the past.

A lot of my issues stem from my own insecurity and that is something only I can deal with but I find it helps to be own and honest with an SO about these things so that they know when I'm struggling with something that may have been triggered by something they said/did but the real issue is with myself and that I need time to deal with that in my own way. In my opinion, communication is everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been struggling with exactly this and all I can say is that honesty with the new guy about what has happened in the past and how it hurt you is important.

If they don't understand what you've been through then they won't understand if you feel insecure/suspicious or if you over react to something because it seems similar to an ex's behavior.

I know how difficult it is to trust again and have faith that this time you won't get screwed over, but if you don't learn to trust again the only person you're hurting is yourself.

<TEXT> This sounds like a case of the grass is always greener.

As someone that's been in a very similar situation to you I know how difficult it can be. But you need to look at it objectively. You have a boyfriend that wants to be with you, he's committed and is in it for the long haul. On the other hand you have someone that's a source of excitement in your life but has never been able to commit to you and isn't willing to be there for you in any way other than physical.

Have you considered that maybe it's not a coincidence that things have suddenly become rocky with you and your boyfriend BECAUSE you're having doubts and fantasies about this other guy? Perhaps you're unintentionally causing problems between yourself and your SO to ease your guilt about the other guy and this is subconsciously pushing you towards the other guy.

You need to decide if your boyfriend is really the person you want to be with, and if you decide that he is then you need to cut off the other guy entirely. Make it clear to him you are not an option any more, delete and block his number if necessary.

Most likely this other guy is only pursuing you now because he can't have you and he wants the challenge. Realistically if you give in and go back to him he will get bored quickly and you wil most likely regret leaving your relationship, but by then it will be too late and the damage will aready be done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's the conclusion I've come to too, I'm going to just cook healthy meals with plenty of veg for myself and offer him some, if he tried it then great, if not then it's up to him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately he isn't a fan of rice or noodles either, but I think I may be able to introduce them easier than veg so that might be something to look into, thanks!

I think he is reluctant to try new things because of the severity of his nut allergy. He is part of the 1% that if he smells nuts it will make him ill so he tends to avoid food he is unsure of in case it could cause a bad reaction. But in saying that he is open minded about everything else so maybe I can bring him around to the idea of trying new foods! </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only vegetables I know for sure he likes are peas, but only the processed kind. I was talking about maybe making a cottage pie and he said he wouldn't mind too much if there was a bit of carrot mushed into it, but that was about it.

He definitely doesn't like mushrooms, peppers, lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes etc.

I'm considering asking him to maybe just try a little veg when I make it for myself because I know that I detested mushrooms when I was younger but now they are one of my favourite things to eat, tastes change! However I don't want to force him and also I think he needs to have the right mentality, if he has the mindset that he's not going to like them then it won't make any difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well we usually take it in turns cooking and I don't want to force him to eat stuff he doesnt like but after researching today and failing to come up with recipes that will suit both of us I've decided that when I'm cooking I'll do us two variations.

For example tonight I plan on having chicken, rice and steamed vegetables, and I'll make him some chicken also but what he decides to have with it is up to him.

I figure it's a little bit more hassle but the only way that it's fair on both of us. I don't want him to feel bad because he doesn't like what I like. The only reason it's really bothering me is because I've noticably put on weight since I've been with him and because I spend half the week at his place I'm eating pretty unhealthily for half the week. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I do worry about his health, but there's not much I can do about it. He's his own responsibility and if he doesn't want to eat healthy etc then I can't change that.

I think because he doesnt see any negative effects from his lifestyle at the moment then he doesn't see a reason to change it, and I can't argue with that really.

Thankfully he loves fish so I'm trying to make sure we have that once a week but it's one of those things that I don't think either of us could eat every night, but I guess it's something! </TEXT>

<TEXT> A blender is actually a really good idea, I may actually be able to sneak some into a lasagne if I do them really fine and maybe eventually I'll be able to convince him to try some when they're not completely mush, just build him up to it slowly.

It's such a pity because I looove mushrooms and peppers and I like to put them in with everything but I can't when I cook for both of us. I find it really frustrating not to be able to have any veggies as I think they add so much flavour, I'm getting a little sick of the plain saltiness of just meat and sauce. </TEXT>

<TEXT> He's 29, and honestly it's a miracle he's still alive considering his diet. His staples are pizza and bacon sandwiches. He rarely eats fruit and drinks heavily on the weekends, yet he doesn't have an ounce of fat on him!

He would definitely notice if I tried sneaking veggies into stuff, he won't even buy pasta sauces that have any vegetables in them (he reads the back to make sure) He's ok with tomato puree but not tomatoes (which we actually agree on)

He also doesn't really like rice, but I'm going to attempt to change that tonight. He really is very set in his ways and prefers to stick to plain foods, especially because of his nut allergy. Thanks for the advice though, I may try the parsnip sauce and see if he notices!

<TEXT> My boyfriend dislikes all vegetables and is severely allergic to all nuts so we eat a lot of meat/pasta/pizza as there isn't much he likes/can eat.

However I love making different foods and love putting vegetables in everything so it's hard to compromise.

Because I've been eating a lot of carb based food with him recently I'm looking for healthy recipes that will keep the calorie count down for me but also something without vegetables so that he can enjoy it too! </TEXT>

<TEXT> A haircut and change of hair colour. If it's an incredibly bad break up I'll get a new piercing or tattoo. I find changing something physical about myself makes me feel better and like I'm having a new start.

Also a night of extememly hard drinking and flirting with strangers never hurts. Beware the emotional hangover the next day though, nothing makes you want to run back to an ex more than throwing up alone and regretting the previous nights decision! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two of my break ups were caused by their ex's.

One was still friends with his ex and told me it was totally platonic, until I found out he had been responsible for her moving into the apartment beside us and he was sneaking out to visit her, also slept in her bed but claimed nothing happened. It came down to him saying he wanted both of us in his life and if I couldn't handle it then that was my problem, so I walked. Found out later he had immediatly tried to get back with her but she rejected him.

The other said he was totally over his ex and four months later upped and left and moved to be back with her completely out of the blue.

One of my biggest learening experiences was a breakup with an SO I was extremely in love with. He was a very good hearted person and treated me wonderfully in so many ways but he couldn't control his drinking and was unable to follow through with any of his promises. I found him increasingly unreliable and lost trust and faith in him so I ended it. It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do but I realised I had to put myself first despite my feelings for him and that it was better for both of us in the long run. We've actually remained friends since this but he still doesn't have his life together so it just goes to show I did the right thing.

<TEXT> I think if a guy labels you as 'crazy' then he's not the kind of guy you're going to want to be with anyway. I have depression/anxiety and struggle with keeping my emotions and moods in check and I couldn't be with someone that wasn't willing to understand that.

In saying that I understand it's hard to broach the subject with a new partner. I've tried everything from laying it all up front very quickly in a sort of 'This is me, take it or leave it' attitude to being six months with someone and still hiding the fact that I take medication from them.

The best way I've found is to just give them the information in an upfront and honest manner. I don't sit people down and say 'Hey, let me tell you my story.' But I do make it clear that my past and my issues are a part of who I am, I'm not ashamed of them and that to be with me it's just something they willl have to accept. But I also make sure they know that I take responsibility for my illness and I cope with it well in my own way so I don't expect them to be a crutch, just to be understanding and patient with me when needs be.

You shouldn't feel there is a stigma to your illness or that you will be seen as 'crazy'. People that think like thast aren't worth your time and the ones that are will understand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a big tendency to over analyze due to insecurity/anxiety as well. I find an anti-depressant and therapy help to keep me balacanced but in day to day life it's all about realising you have control over your emotions and how you choose to think about things.

When I catch myself spiralling into negative thoughts about my relationships I make myself rationalize the situation. I divide it into what I logically know about the situation and what I'm believing/percieving about the situation, I write it down like a pro/con list if need be. I find it helps to take me out of the negative spiralling thoughts and see things clearly before I over react.

And usually I find it best to talk to the person I'm having an issue with openly and honestly, most people don't mind giving a bit of reassurance and it really helps clear the issue up in my mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT> An ex surprised me one Christmas with a huge amount of incredibly thoughtful gifts, such as a miniture jigsaw of the world because he 'wanted to give me the world' (corny I know but very cute at the time)

He insisted I leave the card he got me to the end and when I opened it and read the words I was already crying, then he told me to open the little envelope inside and it was tickets to a one off, never to be repeated, gig by my absolute favourite band, plus train tickets and hotel confirmation for us to stay in London on the weekend of the gig.

I was completely blown away by how incredibly thoughtful and how much time, effort and money he had put into my gifts. We were both students at the time and he was working two jobs so I really appreciated how much effort and money he had put into making it the perfect Christmas for me.

<TEXT> I've battled with anxiety for years and even now it still comes and goes. There are good and bad days, but on bad days it will actually paralize me.

 I will literally sit and panic so much I will be unable to move because the thought of leaving my house or interacting with people is so overwhelming.

Thankfully through therapy and keeping myself in check these episodes are far less frequent nowadays but I can majorly sympathise with people who are badly affected as I used to be so bad I would cry and hyperventilate at the thought of having to leave the house. I became a shut in for six months until I sought professional help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My SO is very proud of his 'dad joke' sesne of humour and bad puns.

The best one yet happened last week:
We were lying in bed naked about to get down to some sexy time and I commented on the fact that I tend to scratch him during sex. I said:

'People are going to be wondering if you're going out with a girl or a bear.'

His reply: 'Well you're bare right now!'

Talk about killing the mood!

I secretly love them but sometimes I roll my eyes so hard at his terrible jokes and puns that my head hurts! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only been with my current SO two months but we're already at that stage of trying to playfully annoy each other. He's much better at it than me though, for example:

He realised I am ridiculously easily frightened so he will scare the bejesus out of me on occasion. Screaming unexpectedly when I walk into a room which in turn makes me scream. Throwing things towards me when I walk into a room, randomly scaring me etc.

Sometimes he will full on just sloppily lick the side of my face which completely wigs me out.

Almost every time I go to sit down in the couch beside him he will stick his hand under my ass at the last minute so that I end up sitting on it which both scares me and worries me that I'm going to end up crushing his hand.

So far the only thing I do to annoy him is repeatedly poke him in the side of the face when he's reading a thread/watching something but even then I usually get fed up because he prides himself on being very laid back and not getting annoyed easily, so if anyone wants to throw me some tips on how to get my own back on him feel free! </TEXT>
