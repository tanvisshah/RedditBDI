<TEXT> My mum (single mum, working 2 jobs) didn't want me going to the same school she did as she had bad memories from there, so she sent me to a "better school" on the more affluent side of town.

From day 1 the kids bullied me because they saw her drop me off in a Q plate (stolen and recovered) Ford Fiesta, and their parents all had more money and nicer cars.

A few months into the school year and I had been bullied everyday, but nothing serious. Then one day while waiting for the bus I got beat up and my bag stolen. So I missed the bus and my homeroom teacher had to take me home and wait with me until my mum finished work and got home, as my keys were in my bag. While waiting she begged me not to change schools, worried about the schools reputation, and then when I went back in a couple of days later she took me to one side and begged me again and I said I'd think about it.

In those days I was off my mum had already contacted the other school, and had only sent me back in to the school that day to make sure I was certain about transferring, and that teacher being more interested in saving face than my wellbeing sealed the deal. I started at my new school the following Monday and made friends straight away :)


And that's how I got bullied so bad I switched schools. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Shake the can well before opening and it'll be perfectly mixed and have a normal cream consistency, or if you need a thicker "heavy" cream drain some of the coconut water off the top of the can when you open it, and then stir well before you add to the recipe. By doing that you may need more cans than the recipe suggests. </TEXT>

I'm going through a similar thing with "friends" right now, so I know how much it stings.

My plan of action is:

Make new friends, be honest about my mental health and when I feel like I have the energy to be sociable make spontaneous plans.

Anyway, I hope you have a good birthday new internet friend üíó </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you. I don't trust her at all.

For more context. In the past my mum has been my confidante. I would tell her about things that were going on in my life, issues I had with my now husband (housework and stuff, nothing major) and one very specific complaint about our accountant messing up a grant and costing us money. I didn't realise what I mistake I was making.

Everything I spoke to her about ended up being gossip between her and her friends. When her friends got sick of her (as they all do) they told my husbands parents everything she had said to them and how she hates him for being lazy, unmotivated, wasteful and arrogant. And said that she had been trying to break us up from the beginning.

So since then she has been on an information diet.

We stopped speaking completely in June this year after a big argument where she went to hit me. We only spoke when she was picking up or dropping off our son (we didnt want to disrupt his routine) but ended up speaking again 2 days before we got married as she apologised and said she would be better. But I don't trust her yet.

She knows we are short of money because Covid took my job and she knows my husband plays golf some weeks. Last week when she came to see our son she said him playing golf was causing us to be poor, and that he is neglecting his family. I set her straight, said he's paying all our bills and rent and is entitled to a hobby (he already had clubs from before he met me) and to keep out of it.

Then she sent me this last night after seeing me for an hour yesterday.

ETA: we aren't poor. We rent a 3 bed house in a beautiful part of the world, all of our bills are paid and we have food on the table. It's tight but it could be a lot worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I remember this feeling well. The isolation, constant fear and sheer exhaustion of having a newborn is so hard, even without the added stress of covid.

Mine is 2 now, so believe me when I tell you it does get better. In the meantime here's some advice:

Make a point of leaving the house, even just for a walk. I did this today and it improved both of our moods.

Invite a friend or family member round once a week to provide adult conversation and an extra pair of hands so you can have a shower or cook a decent meal or whatever you need to do. My in-laws have come round every Thursday evening since our son was born, and it was a lifesaver when he was younger!

Don't worry too much about keeping the house clean, if everyone is alive and happy at the end of the day then it's been a good day.

I'm working from home so I'm always near my phone, if you need to talk or vent or anything please send me a message ‚ù§ </TEXT>

<TEXT> I gained weight, my moods were awful, my skin was a hormonal spotty mess and I had random dry patches of skin on my arms.

But I didn't get pregnant, and didn't have a single period (except when I had it replaced too late)

And I also ended up with less cysts on my ovaries, they were bursting but not being replaced so that was a huge plus for me.

Personally I would have it again now we've had a baby (he was planned, we are one and done) but my moods were so bad I wont put my husband through that, he suffers enough with my rocky mental health as it is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was exactly the same, I felt like a cow being milked 24/7, and being attached to the wall by the plug was such a pain that I couldnt help with our boy much without risking not pumping enough for the next feed.

Formula was an absolute life and sanity saver for me, and baby was so much happier with it too. He slept for longer and put weight on quicker.

If she won't suggest the switch to formula herself I would mention it gently.

Maybe get some cartons of premade formula ready for if she decides spur of the moment she's done like I did.

Congrats and Good luck. It does get easier üíô </TEXT>

The other idea I've heard is leaving the nappy and pants off, and having the bed layered: mattress protector, sheet, mattress protector, sheet. So when they do have an accident in the middle of the night its just a quick job taking the top 2 layers off and back to bed. </TEXT>

I'm not surprised you're getting side effects like sore nipples and nausea, you've overdosed on hormones and your body has no idea what's going on right now.

If you don't want to use condoms there are a lot of other forms of contraception out there that will be less drastic on your body. Eg:

Implant
IUD
Depo (injection)
Various types of pill
Coil
Patch

<TEXT> The issue with taking both MDMA and an SSRI antidepressant is that they both increase your serotonin uptake. Antidepressants do it in a controlled way and MDMA just makes your brain take it all at once and leaves none.

To put it in a crude metaphor, SSRI's are like having a glass of wine a night and leaving the rest of the bottle for the next day. MDMA is like finishing the bottle, and drinking whatever else is in your house until there is not a drop of anything left and you wake up with a stinking hangover.

So mixing them is a bad idea, because the MDMA will empty your brains store of your serotonin but the SSRI will still try to access that store and take what isn't there.

I hope that makes sense. Good luck with it all man. Stick with the antidepressants, dont miss doses and dont come off them without dropping the dose gradually. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My Nmom has refused all invitations to our wedding, told her this morning that we are eloping this week and she was fine with me then posted on Facebook how she "wasn't welcome" </TITLE>

<TEXT> On mobile, sorry for f'd up formatting. Also LONG.

So my fianc√©  and I got engaged last October and he told his parents by WhatsApp but I waited to tell my Nmom in person as I'm more sentimental. She was furious that we told his parents (a whole 30 minutes) before her and held it against my fianc√©, along with a multitude of other things (stories for another time) She announced our engagement on facebook before we even had as we were enjoying our little post engagement bubble for a couple of days. I told her off and she took it down after arguing that she was so excited and its her news too.

So since then her and my fianc√©'s relationship has completely broken down, and is now irreparable, and she has also put a massive dent in my relationship with her also (again, another story) so we have not been speaking for about a month apart from to arrange her seeing our 2 year old boy.

Now we have just today decided to bring our wedding forward from October to next Monday, 7 days from now! I got everything booked and messaged her that we are busy on her usual day to see our son, so she could have him tomorrow instead, which she agreed, and I said I'd call her when he finally decided to nap to explain why (I know I didnt need to explain myself to a narcissist, but I thought I owed her the decency to know before she found out from someone else)

When I called I explained why we would be busy Thursday she seemed excited for us, and apologised that she wouldn't go as it didn't feel right to be there at this time, but hopefully things would be smoothed over enough to celebrate when we can hold a reception next year.

A few hours later she posts on Facebook that we are going to Gibraltar to get married and have told her she is not welcome! My fianc√©, his mum, and several friends screenshotted the post and let me know what was said, so I replied in the comments:

To everyone reading this and judging me:

A) she was invited both times we have tried to organise our wedding and both times she rejected our invitation. Once immediately and the 2nd time after an argument.
B) she hates my fianc√© and has told us both that she would rather do anything or be anywhere else than at our wedding. We have proof of this

After the comments that followed got pretty heated with people arguing for both sides she deleted the post and started messaging me that she wants to come and to let her know the details, she wouldn't miss it for the world, move heaven and earth to be there blah blah blah.

My response: you made me look like the worst daughter ever so I might as well say it now, you are not welcome.

Now she has people messaging me asking me to let her go and she's threatening to turn up anyway even though she doesn't know where or what time the wedding is (I will be calling the registry office to make sure they don't disclose this information to anyone, dont worry).

And I'm not replying to any of them.

Goodbye mum üëã </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok this might be a long one.

I have been on citalopram (celexa) 10mg daily for nearly 2 years. Mostly I have been able to drink any amount and had no adverse reactions besides the usual hangover.

However, recently I have been under ALOT more stress (Covid, family issues, wedding planning, money...) and every time I have more than a couple of drinks my personality changes. I become nasty, hurtful and sometimes suicidal. All of this happens without me knowing, I totally blackout and remember nothing the next day.  This has now happened for 4 weekends in a row.

At first I didnt put the 2 together, just thought it was my stress coming out with being drunk, and I went to see my Dr who has increased the dose to 15mg daily. But last Sunday after another bad Saturday night I researched SSRI's and alcohol and discovered a lot of people have this reaction.

It is not recommended to drink on SSRI's, for 2 reasons.

1. These types of antidepressants can trigger a craving for alcohol, and cause people to become alcoholics.

2. People have reported the same as i have experienced. Manic episodes, blackouts, suicidal thoughts, feeling of invincibility (leading to jumping out of windows and other things you wouldn't normally do)

My advice:
If you do drink on this medication keep it sensible, and if you are under additional stress avoid it all together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being honest I am VLC right now, I'm only responding to messages regarding her seeing my son, anything else is either ignored or responded to with greyrocking.

Before I went VLC I would I ignore the messages where she said those sorts of things, and then when she was being normal I'd start to reply again. This worked for a while, but during lockdown she was quite needy and with her being alone the whole time I gave in and responded to every message, but that has led to the situation I'm in now with her as she felt like she was back in control and could treat me like crap with no reason.

Seriously good luck with it. My DM's are open if you need some support or to rant xx </TEXT>

My advice would be not to rise to it, and don't apologise for not replying quick enough (which I assume you've done 1000 times explaining you aren't awake at that time) She has chosen not to listen to you so don't waste your energy saying it again.
Dont Justify Argue Defend or Explain (JADE) any longer.

If you want to continue a relationship with her make sure you're happy with the terms. You are not her emotional punchbag or crutch.

<TEXT> It's been said already but dropping off meals for them will be such a help, as well as some cleaning and laundry (although I was too proud to let anyone help me and would clean before anyone came round, I now look back and realise I was daft)

Let them nap while you watch the baby. Babies have this amazing thing where they wake up every hour, and it is torture! My boy was such a bad sleeper so we took it in turns to sleep so we would each get a solid 5 hours a night, this lasted about 4 months and naps were very important for our sanity.

If you make plans and they cancel, be understanding. Especially if those plans involve them leaving the house. Seriously, taking a baby out takes more planning and preparation than a 2 week holiday!

If they have any pets you could offer to take them for a while, to take some of the pressure off.

Learn to change a nappy/diaper and offer when you are there.

If mum is breastfeeding make sure she has water, and take snacks just for her when you visit. (I mean take snacks anyway but making milk is hungry work so momma needs her yummies)

Check in often. It sounds like you're a great friend and would do this anyway, but it's worth saying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I snack on a chunk of mature cheddar. Being quite strong I can't eat too much of it so it stops me from overeating, and it's a good source of fat and protein to help satiate me until my next meal.

For me it's not about stopping snacking it's about what you snack.

You can also try having some cooked chicken in the fridge ready to eat, again it's more filling than nuts and not as easy to overeat.

And weigh everything onto a separate plate/bowl before you eat it so you dont have any more accidents with eating too much while zoned out.

Good luck OP </TEXT>

<TEXT> She's just a typical narcissist and is trying to make it about her. She is trying to get an apology from my fiancees parents for something they havent done (not intentionally anyway) and is using the wedding as leverage over them, and us. She was hoping I would get upset and end up begging them to make it right and she would win. She keeps posting about "I hope they make it right before I miss my daughter getting married". Problem is as an only child of a single mother I had my eyes closed to her behaviour for my whole life, and now I'm not accepting it any longer. She almost ruined our engagement,  she did ruin the birth of our son, she's not ruining our wedding. </TEXT>

My boy wouldn't latch properly so I expressed and then fed it him in a bottle, but I always got grief from his paediatrician, and Spanish people who passed us bottle feeding him out of the house would judge us. When we switched to formula due to my production dropping to 3oz a day (yep, total) that was a whole new issue üôÑ Also I wouldnt have been paid anything the extra month if I had taken it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spain is 16 weeks (20 if you're breastfeeding) paid by the government, but they take their time about it. My son was 14 weeks old when I finally got any maternity pay, so luckily we had saved enough to pay our rent and bills in that time, and have amazing family and friends who would pop in with food and nappies and other things to help us out. Life with a newborn is hard enough, without all the added crap from employers and the government.

Good luck OP xx </TEXT>

She was in the wrong for saying it the way she did, and I would hope the head cashier/controls manager/branch manager picked her up on it. She did need to say something, but not like that. A gentle referral to a personal banker would have been an ideal way for her to handle it.

<TEXT> Congratulations!!

Be prepared for your wife to be cranky and hormonal both during pregnancy and after birth. Silly things like dropping something can evoke every reaction from tears and anger to hysterical laughter. You have been warned!!

If momma is breastfeeding or pumping she will be super hungry and thirsty all the time, but wont even notice. Provide her with cushions, a drink and snacks.

Once baby is here and you know what size nappies you need stock up. There is nothing more frustrating than having to rummage through drawers and changing bag to find a couple of nappies on a sunday night to last till the morning.

Buy jumperoos/walkers 2nd hand, after spending ‚Ç¨80 on a vibrating rocker chair he used twice then decided he hated I've bought everything else off facebook.

Don't buy too much clothing too soon, I know its tempting but you will end up with so many unworn clothes after everyone gives you "teeny tiny adorable outfits they just couldn't resist."

Don't pressure her to breastfeed. Sometimes it doesn't work, and that's ok. I managed 3 weeks pumping to give my boy breastmilk as he wouldn't latch, which meant I was plugged into the wall for roughly 18/24 hours a day! At my best I produced max 8 oz a day and was utterly miserable. Switching to formula gave me my freedom back to enjoy being a mum instead of a dairy cow.

And be prepared for when you're at work and she's at home for her to feel slightly jealous that you get to leave the house without a baby. If she says you need milk and wants to go alone, let her, she probably needs that 20 minute break and will almost definitely scoff some chocolate in the carpark before coming home.

Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> We're using myfitnesspal, you can change the macros in it. it's not precise unless you pay for pro but it gives you a really good guide as to how your doing daily hitting those macros. You can also put in your weight and measurements so you can see the changes on a graph and it helps you appreciate even the small wins. You can scan the barcode on the food packet and input the amount you are having, so dont freak out when it comes up with 9gs carbs for 100g parmasan for example, just change the portion to what you're actually having and it'll be much less. Good luck! We are 2 weeks in and lost around 2 kilos each already. X </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really proud of you for sharing this with us.

I'm going to say it sounds like post natal depression/anxiety. I felt exactly the same when my boy was crying as a baby. Not always, but if he had a bad day with teething or colic and I'd not slept well it got BAD.

Ask your midwife/health visitor/doctor for support and medication.

And know that with time your baby will get better at communicating their needs and you will be able to know without even thinking about it what the problem could be.

Good Luck OP. üíô </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doesn't matter whether it was assumed, the fact is OP knew and wasnt told not to say anything. I've been pregnant and didnt want everyone to know before 12 weeks had passed, told our parents only because of the number of doctors and bathroom visits they would have worried, and told them not to tell anyone.

My mum told people in the estate agents next to my work (so she could be nearer to us) and naturally everyone in our town knew within a few days.

That's a fuck up, because I said not to tell people.

But if someone told me someone was pregnant and didnt say it was a secret I would assume (rightly or wrongly) that it was public knowledge because otherwise why tell me?!

I mean that's just my opinion.

<TEXT> Yeah I'm gonna agree with the others and say you can't leak it all out once and it's gone. I struggled to breastfeed, I ended up taking my boy to hospital thinking something was wrong and it turned out he was under fed and almost jaundiced because he wasnt getting enough milk from me even with pumping almost continuously and trying to breastfeed, so I switched to formula. My milk took about 5 days to dry up, and even a hot shower made me leak all over the place! And to avoid mastitis I had to keep "taking the edge off" by pumping a few ounces, because SERIOUSLY swollen and sore boobs are not fun.

Sorry you have an Nmum. Being aware of it now is a good step towards protecting yourself and your baby in the future.

Good luck OP, need any advice or an ear to listen please dm me xx </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA

They couldn't afford to home themselves and their newborn and you stepped up, and provided food nappies and the rest, and helped them care for the newborn, and then at the last minute offered to have their baby for a few days, and instead of showing gratitude she decides to tear down your ability to care for a child because you dont have one?

Sounds to me like you already looked after more than 1 baby for 6 months.

And assuming someone else will take care of their kid so they can go away, I mean that's just pure entitled.

Me and my fiance have a toddler and have been away without him for the weekend, but we have always asked our parents first if they can have him. That's just common sense!

Sorry but I would let them cancel their weekend away, if you have the baby now they will continue to treat you like this because you'll be telling them it's ok. </TEXT>

<TEXT> >Massive pressure to come with myself and DH to appointments, and to be there when I give birth. In the end she backed off about my scans, but only after I made it clear I didn't want her there and still with much guilt tripping. In an argument today she essentially said that she should be in the delivery room because she's my mother and she was here first (vs DH who you know, is only my husband).

This is ringing some SERIOUS alarm bells. I mean don't get me wrong it all is. But this is exactly the same as my Nmum.

Mine ended up camped out in the waiting room during my labour (after being told not to come until I had given birth as she wouldn't be allowed into the delivery room anyway and would have to wait at least an hour to see us, so she should get a good nights rest and then use that time to make the 30 min journey to the hospital), she repeatedly pressed the bell for a nurse to ask if she could come in, and was told no every time, and was also messaging me to ask me to let her in (I ignored the messages). About 30 mins after I had given birth my OH messaged her to let her know, and she rang the bell again and demanded the nurse make me let her in! At this point I was still being stitched up and my placenta was being examined by the student nurse, no way I was letting her in!

So she left. No goodbye message, no apology, nothing. My OH went out to say we were being taken up to the maternity ward and she could come see us and she just wasn't there.

And that is how my Nmum made what should have been one of the best days of our lives all about her.

Moral of the story: Dont tell her you're in labour. Maybe even give yourself some time to bond and be a family before you tell her you've given birth.

And buy your own cute things. You want to remember your LO dressed in love, not spite.

Good luck OP. ‚ô°‚ô° </TEXT>

<TEXT> My SO wont even be in the same room as her now. He tried for my sake, as did his parents  but they are sick of her games and lies.

Our problem is I didnt realise she was a Narcissist until I met them and I realised what a family is supposed to look like, so I haven't been protecting myself or my SO from her for very long and that means I opened us up to her schemes unwittingly. Thankfully she hasn't got between us, but I'm sure she has managed to sabotage my relationships and friendships in the past.

Low contact is the best route I would say. Protect yourselves and be happy. üíï </TEXT>

<TEXT> In a similar situation. My Nmum has never liked any of my boyfriends. I'm now engaged to the love of my life and she doesn't like him (or his family) I've come to realise it's because she feels like she's going to be replaced as the most important person in my life and she doesn't like that.

She has even tried to break us up, constantly talks shit about them all and tells her friends she's worried I'm changing because of them.

Be prepared for all of this behaviour as your relationship becomes more serious. And don't fall into the same trap I did where she acted all lovely and pally when I needed to rant about about living together (housework and money generally) and now holds those things I said against him.

Good luck with it all. As long as you are happy her opinion isn't important. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is a long post, and I'm not the best at story writing, but it is the true story of my first time being a vixen/hotwife. Please enjoy :)

So I‚Äôm on Tinder, haven‚Äôt been very successful but that is the struggle of many hotwives. I swiped right on a guy who is hot and looked interesting, and we swapped numbers. Within a few minutes I got a couple of dick pics and a video, I honestly thought ‚Äúoh great here we go..‚Äù and almost blocked him, but he seemed kind of sweet with it, so I gave him a shot.

By Thursday night just gone, we had been talking for a couple of weeks, not making plans just getting to know each other a bit more. He said how hard he had been working (as a personal trainer) So I joked that if he was free the next evening I could help him relax, and he was into it.

The next morning (Friday) cucky asked what we would be doing with our free evening. I mentioned I may have a date lined up. We had our usual discussion about how it would work because he doesn‚Äôt want anyone here or me to go to a strangers house, and I don‚Äôt want to have sex in a car, so we agreed if it actually happens it‚Äôs best in a hotel. I Messaged OG (Other Guy) about it and he agreed a hotel was a good idea, so cucky looked online and booked it for us.

When we got home from work I started getting ready, I made cucky paint my toenails to get him nice and submissive (he likes feet), and then put on his cage. I showered, chose a dress and got made up ready to go. We didnt have time for a warm up, so my good little cucky suggested I take my clitoral stimulator to warm up in the car.

Warming up in the car was so hot, with my dress pulled up and my pants pulled to the side my toy was really doing the job. I had to stop when we got in traffic, and I almost got too close to cumming before we even got there!

I checked into the hotel and cucky dropped me to the bar to meet OG, following a few minutes behind so OG wouldn‚Äôt know it was him. We sat and got to know each other over a drink, and got a bit flirty. I was the one to suggest going to the hotel, happy that he wasn‚Äôt a catfish or a weirdo.

As soon as we got in the lift at the hotel he started kissing me. Deep, passionate kisses that made my body tingle with anticipation. We got out the lift all giddy but behaving, and walked into the hotel room as calm as we could. The door had barely clicked closed when he started kissing me again, more desperate than before. He kissed my neck and bit my lip. He turned the lock, and I knew we were definitely going to have sex.

He resumed kissing me, and pushed me backwards onto the bed. He covered my neck and chest in kisses, then stood me up and took off my dress. He looked me up and down and bit his bottom lip, which made me feel like the sexiest woman alive. I took off his shirt and Jeans and he was rock hard in his tight red boxers.

He pushed me back onto the bed and we started kissing again, he pinned down my shoulders and started kissing his way down my body until he got to my pants. He pulled them to one side, and started gently licking my clit, his tongue felt amazing! After a few minutes of licking, he slid his fingers into my already dripping pussy and started rubbing my G-spot, first gently, then with a look to check I was ok with it, he started pounding me with his fingers, so hard and fast that I didn‚Äôt even have chance to feel the build up and I squirted for possibly the first time ever!

I needed a minute to compose myself, and let what had just happened sink in, so I pulled off his boxers, got on my hands and knees and started licking and sucking his 8 inch cock. It was longer than cucky‚Äôs, so when I took it all in I could feel it hit the back of my throat, which made me want to deep throat it. I started deepthroating him, loving the moans he was making in response, and getting wetter myself with his pleasure. He took my hair and started fucking my face until I was gagging. We recorded all of this and sent the video to cucky, who was sat in the car outside the hotel, knowing it would drive him wild.

He put a condom on (safety first!) And pushed me onto my back and guided his cock deep into my wet pussy, recording it for cuck. He  pulled in and out a couple of times to get comfortable, then he started fucking me rough and fast, and so hard the bed was thumping against the wall! It didn‚Äôt take long for me to squirt again, and again. He stopped after 3, letting us rest for a bit.

I took the opportunity while he was lay on his back to start sucking him again, he told me that he doesn‚Äôt normally cum without finishing himself off so that made me determined I was going to make him cum! I made it a really sloppy blowjob, and was sucking and stroking at the same when he said he was close and wanted to cum in my mouth, so I got on my knees and kept sucking until he grabbed his pulsating cock. I stuck my tongue out and caught his load in my mouth, swallowed it, and licked his cock clean, savouring all of his delicious cum.

After he came he forced me back onto my back and finger fucked me again, making me squirt again and again and again, until we were both tired and sweaty.

I took a shower, dried off and walked back into the bedroom naked, and we lay on the bed and talked for a bit, about our past relationships and work and other random things. He was about to go in the shower and as he got up he kissed me again. That kissing led to his fingers finding my pussy, another squirt, and then fucking again, and another squirt.

He went to get up and shower again, almost got off the bed, and somehow his fingers found my pussy again, squirt, squirt.. omg I was empty!!

He finally went in the shower and I got dressed, we might not have left the room otherwise. He came out the bathroom and got dressed himself, we had another long, sexually charged kiss, this one  recorded to show cucky how good our kiss was, and he left the room.

I stood at the bathroom door, looked in the mirror and just grinned at myself, not able to truly believe what had just happened. I waited 2 minutes and went down to the car where cuck was still waiting for me, eager to know what had happened.

He drove me home, listening intently to all of the details I could give him in my post sex haze. He was looking forward to reclaiming me when we got home.

When we got home he made me a drink, and sat on the floor to rub my feet while I told him more, and I read out the texts me and OG were sending each other, planning to meet again soon. I told him to lie on the floor so I could rest my feet on him, and I settled with one foot on his mouth and one on his neck, with him holding my glass. He was still locked up and getting really sore balls.

We went up to bed, where he licked my pussy until I was satisfied I was clean, and I finally let him out of his cage, but with his hands tied to the headboard so he couldn‚Äôt get tempted to touch what was no longer his. I sucked and licked his cock, telling him how much bigger OG's was and how I wish it was his cock in my mouth, and when he was about to cum told him he wasn‚Äôt allowed to cum in my mouth, and while I stroked him I teased him with the idea of OG hiding in our honeymoon suite so he could use me on our wedding night and then he would be the ultimate cuckold. This idea pushed him over the edge and he cum so hard it hit his pillow next to his head.

As it was my first time with another guy, I expected the comedown to start with the refractory period, so we had lots of cuddles and love you‚Äôs, before falling asleep at about 4am.

I'm getting wet again just writing this down and reliving it in my mind. I can‚Äôt wait for next time.. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds like my mum all over tbh. I completely sympathise with you, and 100% agree that you are NTA and are doing the right thing putting your foot down. Babies need a schedule, if he is sleeping dont even open the door as you know you're just gonna get moaned at and then have to make drinks and food. I actually locked my gate on a couple of occasions so they would have to call me instead of banging on the door and waking us. Anyone of your family who tells you you're being selfish should expect a phone call every time your baby wakes in the night, because then they MIGHT understand just how tired you are. Take the time to bond, cry, sleep, eat and do what you need to do to be happy because that's what your baby needs. Being a mum is one of the hardest jobs in the world, and you're doing great Xx </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So at the time I let it wash over me, but what happened has never and will never be forgiven by me or my fiance.

Last september I gave birth to a beautiful, perfectly healthy baby boy. Labour started in the afternoon on my due date, and we didnt tell our parents until I was admitted onto the labour ward so as not to get them excited if it was another false alarm (we had a few).

So when I rang my mum at about 9pm while my fiance was getting some drinks and calling his parents. I told her the situation as it was, I had been admitted at 3cm dialated, was having an epidural so couldn't move and would be checked again at 1am. She said she wanted to come to the hospital now, but I told her not to because it was still early, and she wouldn't be allowed in the room so would be stuck waiting in the waiting area for a very long time. I said I would call again at 1am with an update. My OH's parents said they would go to bed and wait until our son was born to come down as they would take 30 mins to get there anyway. (My mum lives 2 streets away so would take the same time for her)

At 12.30 my Nmom starts calling me. She's waiting outside and wants to come in. When I tell her no she cant come in she starts ringing the bell to get a nurses attention to be allowed in. The nurse comes and tells us she's being a pest, can we tell her she's not allowed in. We're actually trying to get some sleep. (The epidural meant I could get cat naps in between checks) so I call her and tell her to stop ringing the bell, it's not my rules it's the hospital, she can't come in because my fiance was my birthing partner, and I could only have 1. She has a whinge but leaves us alone for a bit, and I text her with the update at just past 1am that I was more dialated but still not enough.

Now apparently between then and the call she got to say he was born she was out in the waiting room (a horrible room with big windows and about 6 seats, all occupied by another waiting family) sitting on the floor with her boyfriend at the time doing meditation to keep calm. Just waiting and getting more and more annoyed at the other family and at me and my fiance for not letting them in. (Apparently he should have left the room so she could be in there with me)

Our boy was born at 5.55am, and by 6.10 she was pestering the nurses to be allowed in, I was still being stitched up! We told them under no circumstances were they to let her in the delivery room, she had wait until I was up on the ward. So they told her no she couldn't go in, it would be another 30 mins.

She left.

No message, no call, nothing.

My fiance went out to get her while me and our boy were being moved upstairs, and she had gone. I messaged her after he told me, and she took hours to reply that she had to leave because the dogs were at home alone, and she was upset.

She didnt visit until the next day. Claimed to be too upset to visit the first day, and too tired from sitting in the waiting room all night "for no reason"

I haven't actually had it out with her over it, we have talked about it but she can't see past her feelings,basically butthurt because we should have let her swap with my fiance, we should have let her in while I was being stitched up, and she was not the first to hold him. But because she gets so annoyed at us for being selfish, despite me telling her not to come that early and warning her they would be waiting hours and wouldn't be allowed in, I just close off.

I know that if I let out my true feelings, or even a small portion of how me and my fiance feel, we would never speak again. There are only so many times I can say that she was warned without just telling her to stop being a dick and leave us alone if we hurt her that much.

Fiance hates her. He doesn't like many people and certainly doesn't suffer fools, but he has never hated someone like this. He sees how she treats me and it makes his blood boil so much, he despises her. Makes things a bit awkward for me, I still want her to be part of our life, but I can see why he feels like that.

The worst part is that I feel guilty for making her feel bad. That's what her narcissistic behaviour has taught me to feel, guilty, for wanting a private, peaceful birth for our son.

I dont need advice, because I know what you're all going to say. I just wanted to get it off my chest as I still can't actually believe it happened.

TLDR: Nmom came to hospital while i was in labour after being told not to as would be a long wait. Left after son was born, but before meeting him as they had been there so long (6 hours) they were tired and the dogs were alone. Didnt visit our son until the next day and blames my fiance for not allowing her in. Makes me feel guilty for the whole thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To the people saying why didnt she get the card in her own name by lying about her income.

You can lie about your income on your application but they dont look at income they look at credit score, maybe she's had shitty financial past and cant get a card in her own name.

Not justifying anything here just explaining as a personal banker how the application for a credit card works. I've had people with no income get accepted, and people with high income get declined. If she got declined and appealed the decision she would then have to prove her income, which obviously she couldn't do as she hasn't got one, and the application would actually damage her credit score further.

It was a shitty thing to do, and I hope if they ever end up in that kind of financial situation again they can tackle it together.

He needs to get his head out of the sand and take some responsibility, she needs to learn to talk to him before things get that bad. Easier said than done but no relationship can survive without communication. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My cuck and I have that sort of agreement. We actually have a contract, which is quite restrictive to be honest,  but it covers the vanilla stuff quite well. He isn't allowed sex with me, cant see me naked, can't cum without my permission, must offer to eat me out every day, cant refuse my advances, must clean up my bull and I if we ask him to, must help with preparation for a date, warm me up for a date and must fund the date (hotel, meal anything like that) we are new at it too and it's not all happened yet but it's fun to be in the right mindset even outside of your playtime with your bull. </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me I enjoy being a sub/slave non sexually for the fact I can turn my mind off and just be focused on my bliss, even though I'm doing things to make you happy. I am dominant in all aspects of my vanilla life so to not be in control of a situation and being given instructions means I can switch off, and being used sexually puts me in subspace for the same reason, it's all about not having to think and just being in the moment and able to have fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being honest this is exactly how my boyfriend (now cuck) started off with the kink. I would wait for him to approach the subject, because if you start the conversation it could make him think you want to cheat or have cheated, which isn't the fantasy of cuckolding. Maybe when you are out together just a lingering look at a guy you would take a fancy to, or a passing comment on someone will entice him to talk about it. Just my opinion, because I know how that gets my cuck excited. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm on fetlife.com and tinder, so far I have met two good matches that way, so excited to play with them! It can be hard going and repetitive thinking you have someone you could meet and then they get cold feet or say something that turns you off, but I'm sure you'll find the right bull in the end. Good luck and happy hunting! </TEXT>
