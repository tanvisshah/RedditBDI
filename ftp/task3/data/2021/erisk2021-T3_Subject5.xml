<TEXT> Lmao this reminded me of how I tried to read Finnegans Wake earlier this year and it made me absurdly angry. Like you've never seen a person so pissed off at words. That shit is literally impossible to read and everyone went like ohhh James Joyce you're such an auteur. We love your 800 page long keysmash it's soooo deep. Like no, this is just terrible and the only reason anyone read it is because he put out Ulysses first which by all accounts was in English and made sense. Ugghhhhh. Never thought I would hate a piece of fiction more than The Sun Also Rises but HERE we are. Anyway I made it through about 20 pages then gave up cause instead of communicating ideas that thing sucks information out of your head and was bringing me close to death.

I read just The Fellowship of the Ring and marked that as not read but I read Inferno and Purgatorio and marked that read. Halfway point I guess, just noting it's not clear what you should do there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think this is a really interesting survey and I do like it a lot. Sorry this is long af

>!I was going to say that there was a serious misalignment between the question you ask first about your opinion and the study itself, I got the Moody and Marvell paper and you ask about gun ownership then the study's about cc licenses. But then I went back to make sure I was writing a good review and saw you have multiple studies with seemingly opposing conclusions. That makes what you're doing way more interesting! Still, the fact that they didn't line up bothered me a lot while actually taking it. If you put a quick debrief at the end I think a lot of people here would really like it, plus it would appease windbags like me who experience physical pain if they can't fully nuance their take lolll!<

Also, I think it would be interesting to ask for your opinion again after you have read (or not read) the studies just to see if you can pick up a backfire/confirmation bias effect.

Finally, what does "half a word is good enough for me" mean? Like, that you can figure out what someone is saying partway through their sentence? If this is the case I think "half a sentence" makes more sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't say I think this political compass does a better job than the more mainstream ones. Based on the blurbs, I wouldn't agree with most of my scores, and I had trouble answering a good number of the questions because I disagreed with the premise. Not to discount it entirely, but perhaps it would be best supplemented with a traditional political compass score, sapplycompass, or 8values, etc., or just letting the respondent input the political ideology they subscribe to. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're much more likely to get responses putting this into an online form such as in Google Forms.

I can't actually recall any specific examples of experiencing sexism from peers as a child. I was kind of poorly adjusted overall and the people who were mean to me about it were all boys, but I think that was more socialization than sexism, they were also mean to the weird boys in class. I got the impression that boys looked down on girls but I can't pinpoint any singular incident... there was just this attitude I felt where a lot of the boys felt being good at sports is cool and being good at academics is tryhard, so the skills the boys tended to have were better than the skills the girls had, which is obviously backwards reasoning. But again I can't remember this ever leading to, like, an event.

The main thing I remember is complaining to adults about the boys who were constantly mean to me and literally like 95% of the time I got "ohhh he just has a crush on you uwu" when I tell you this STILL boils my blood remembering it... no one took me seriously, it definitely came from a boys-will-be-boys mentality. Similar issue with "I don't want kids" being met with "you'll change your mind! I know more than you about your opinions," which I still get, to this day, thank you My Family.

I also remember getting into an argument with my dad at the age of like... seven because he doesn't believe in the wage gap. r/wokekids

Oh, there is one thing, I got told it was weird to be friends with a boy because my best friend in kindergarten was this guy named Zack. So I started bullying him because he wouldn't let me ghost him, which I think is part of what made many of the kids hate me. Like I said, poorly adjusted - couple levels of retrospectively incomprehensible reactions there. But I was mean to him for maybe two months and then the baby jock posse was mean to me for the next like 6 years so,

Anyway I remember a lot more people being explicitly racist than sexist to me in elementary school. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, it seems like an interesting survey! However, I felt that two of the questions were a bit ambiguous. First, "Witches are real": there are 100% real people who call themselves witches/Wicca, so I put true, but I don't think they can actually do magic. I think you may have been going for something like "witches have supernatural powers"?

Second, "The main purpose of the justice system is punitive." Yes, it currently IS, but I don't think it SHOULD be. I put disagree because I think you were asking about an ideal system, but that wording is up to interpretation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok, first of all sorry I have writes too much disorder.

Puberty is very upsetting to a lot of kids, and I think I understand where she is coming from. Growing up is in some respects about learning what you are and are not willing to put up with to fall in line with societal expectations. But that process can be emotionally charged. Both being forced/pressured into changing how you behave and being judged for not doing so suck, whether or not it's at all reasonable (like, you just have to wear deodorant now), and I'm guessing she may be conflicted even though rationally, she knows her choice. It's similar to why the decision to wear makeup or not is so emotionally charged - you feel deeply judged for your appearance AND for wanting to change your appearance at the same time. Or she could just straight up be forgetting because it's a new habit, but getting annoyed if you remind her because that's just hardwired into human psychology I think, I could be making it too deep.

I'm not a parent, but I think you're handling it fine overall - I think this is just something that kids go through. She'll learn eventually either to remember to do it or how to stop caring about occasional judgment, for this and each other social norm, through experience. My mom first wouldn't let me shave when I was young then tried to pressure me into it when I was older, so your approach is much better.

Just let her know that anyone who cares whether she shaves or not is in the wrong, and make sure she knows you do not care at all and won't bring it up again if she doesn't want. Enforce that you're not going to leave a family outing because of imaginary judgmental people, especially when she can just wear a swim shirt... If it's other kids teasing her, she should be allowed to remove herself, but teach her mechanisms to deal with that. And make sure she knows she can't behave like she is to you - you can either remind her or not, but either way you don't want to hear it when you do what you agreed, because it's wrong to blame other people for the results of your own decisions, so I would explain all that to her at a time when she's calm. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciate surveys like this, but these questions are really weird. The topic I was assigned was "people who want lower taxes." First of all, the *reason* why someone wants to change the tax code is extremely important and this is oddly phrased like the survey taker wants to raise taxes on everyone just for the hell of it. It might be better to say "lower taxes on the rich" or "lower business taxes" etc. Second of all, something like "People who want lower taxes should stop and allow others to pursue their creativity" makes literally no sense, they're not related. This means that "strongly disagree" could mean "No, that's not the reason," "They shouldn't stop in the first place," or "Huh??" </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is how I feel as well. Taking a class that covered abiogenesis really cemented this for me. There are a frankly insane number of remote ass coincidences that needed to occur for life to exist in the first place, let alone humans. Like: we needed to be on a planet with liquid water, then there was a series of freak accidents in deep-sea vents that led to the first cells (so the prevailing theory goes). Then photosynthesis, which is weird as all hell, had to evolve. Then, some archaea and bacteria somewhere did some straight up magic fusion bullshit to create eukaryotes. That's not even covering all the godmodding that had to happen for us humans to evolve into the only organisms capable of doing something like, say, communicating with extraterrestrials. All of those things have each only happened once in history, as far as we have any idea.

I'm willing to believe that something like bacteria maybe exists on other planets, but I think the odds of other intelligent life, or even multicellular macroorganisms, are more astronomical than people typically give it credit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What the actual hell. Your brother sounds like a STEMlord, I didn't know they still made those. I suggest using the grey rock method to shut these comments down in the future. Just don't engage. You know why you are interested in the field and what the degree can do for you, if your feelings change then you can switch but no one else's opinion is worth a damn.

Getting your civ e undergrad doesn't teach you shit about psychology, it doesn't even teach you enough to get your professional engineering license. Source: literally my major. It's so completely unhinged to think you know better than every social scientist everywhere just because you can use the Bernoulli equation now. So be confident in yourself and don't give him a reaction when he picks on you about it. Besides, even if you were getting a basket-weaving degree, which you're *not,* if you can afford it that's your prerogative and constantly making fun of you would still not be an appropriate reaction. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try to live where your classes will be, honestly. The bus from Cook/Doug to Livi or Busch takes long af and all the other combos are always suuuuper packed at prime time. Also prioritize the building type you want to live in - the traditional halls vs apartments etc are really different experiences.

C/D has the best opportunities for meal swipe food and is probably the nicest looking, plus if you play music you can use the Mason Gross practice halls. College Ave is the easiest to get to all of the other campuses from, plus Easton and the Yard are right there so it's easy to go to parties or just get good takeout. Brower is pretty bad but they added a bunch more swipe options. Busch is lame and the dining hall sucks but if you're SOE it's so worth it for the 10 minute walk to classes. Also the gym there has the most facilities but I underutilized that so lol. Livi's dining hall is also good, there's a little shopping plaza, and the movie theater's there, but I haven't actually lived there. </TEXT>

I also think that OP could consider talking to her uncle and aunt about this - did either of them act weird at any point with that relationship, and if so, how did they deal with it?

<TEXT> All this and you want to add another class? I wouldn't recommend 19 credits to anyone, ever. I have not taken any of these courses at RU but I've heard bad things about orgo and gen physics, besides, 16 credits plus a job is already a lot to juggle. Some people can handle it for sure - I know someone who literally did 21 credits a few semesters and still was super active in extracurrics etc - but personally I tried a similar courseload my sophomore fall and ended up having to take a W for orgo.

You can always change your schedule during add/drop but you may be constrained by sections closing. I personally always do sign up for an extra class during the initial sign up period and sometimes a second one because then you have some leeway if you're really unhappy with any of the courses, have a couple electives you're picking between, or want to adjust the expected difficulty. Guessing most of these are fine but be careful about courses that are only held in fall. Talk to your advisor too </TEXT>

HUH?
> Your extensive efforts to be proactive in making your course more accessible/bearable/what not has gone COMPLETELY unnoticed by these students, not because you tried but because of the nature of the subject and their lack of interest for it.

"Your students dgaf about your class or any of the work you put into making the coursework achievable and accessible and BECAUSE they don't give a shit they think it's fine to cheat" im not exactly a midtek fan but how is this not a valid reason to be upset?

>Being a snitch in such a silly circumstance as the one you’re in is outright stupid and I feel no sympathy for you given how annoying you are and how difficult you are in uncertain times like these.

a professor reporting cheating in their class isn't being a snitch omfg. people who tell the professor about cheating are snitches, once it gets that far fucking obviously you're going to get in trouble.

<TEXT> he grades negotiation way different from DWO ([syllabus](https://smlr.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/505.01billdwyer_0.pdf)). 2nd half of class is a practice negotiation and the weekly assignment is just to write up what happened, no other homework, 2 40-ish-question multiple choice exams. it's one of those classes where you get out what you put in imo, you could easily skip all the readings etc and do fine as long as you go to class.

i agree with you that the grading for DWO isn't my ideal. i thought the quizzes were too short to really be representative of your understanding, and then, ughhh, a group project makes sense for that class but i still hated it.

<TEXT> I can vouch for Intro to Labor Studies and Population and Society, which I took with Prof Martino and Prof Phillips respectively, they were both really nice, learn-everyone's-name types. I also took History of Labor 1880-1945 (37:575:202) with Brucher, which was interesting but honestly covered a lot of the same ground as Intro to Labor so I would pick one or the other. That one I believe fills the writing core requirement and the writing is graded **very** leniently.

This semester I'm also taking Apiculture (11:370:308) and I'm REALLY MAD we aren't gonna get to work with the bees. Actually procrastinating on writing the final essay for that lol. But if it's something you're interested in, check it out next spring! Didn't disappoint. And actually the most popular elective in the Labor Studies dept (according to Prof Dwyer who teaches it, anyway,) is Negotiation (37:575:326), which gives you a practical skill you can use for the rest of your life. You run through scenarios each class so you get practice as well... again, one of the worst classes I've ever taken that could have been forced online, but it is what it is.

This was a major course but the only prereq is 1 semester of chem and I really enjoyed it - Chemical Principles of Environmental Science (11:375:202). Reinfelder is such a sweetheart, the homework was always really short, and the quizzes/tests were very easy. If you liked chemistry in high school and have any interest in environmental science you will enjoy this class.

I'm a little bit afraid I'm doxing myself LOL OP has it worse though.

<TEXT> I think that this may conflate "academic" with vocabulary level, or at least the survey-takers are.

For instance, >!parlance is ranked as more academic than 'speech' even though, in my opinion, 'speech' is far more likely to find use in an academic text. I can't think of any reason for using the word parlance except in the phrase "common parlance," whereas there's a whole field called speech science. Same for discover vs. find, researchers will use "findings" "we find" much more often than "we discovered," which honestly sounds a little weird in that context. And I can't think of any reason to use either friendly or amiable, I would probably say something like "outgoing disposition," personally.!<

I would prefer that the instructions say something like, select the word you think would be more likely to appear in a research paper, and also probably a good idea to ask how much exposure participants have to that sort of writing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lot of AP research posts on here recently, good luck with your project! I have a couple of comments if you don't mind:

- I don't think you're going to get people to straight up admit that looking at memes changed their political beliefs sjdfklsjs. Also, this is an issue for any study that has a comparison test like this, but people are going to remember the answers they just put and be reluctant to change them to avoid looking hypocritical even if there was an impact.

- I don't believe I've ever seen this political compass test and I took a lot more issues with some of the questions/the results than usual. There's no perfect one but imo the classic politicalcompass and 8values ones are a bit better.

- I'm going to tell you what I tell everyone trying to do political surveys on here: there are literally more communists than Republicans on this sub, so I would seriously consider seeking additional samples and/or reweighting results if you want your study to reflect any population larger than "r/samplesize." </TEXT>

<TEXT> I kind of agree with you that the origin of the bride wearing white is kind of silly/probably sexist, but I would argue it’s totally divorced from that at this point. That's not the issue, though. I will explain why I think it’s rude a bit more. Unfortunately I suffer from cannot be concise about ANYTHING disease, tl;dr you should avoid pissing off a couple at their wedding because it’s about them, and right or wrong most people will be pissed if you wear a white dress, therefore it’s rude.

Two core underlying thoughts here: first, a wedding is supposed to be about celebrating the couple getting married, so you should weight their preferences more strongly than your own. Second, like it or not, this cultural norm of "only the bride wears white" exists and is pretty strong.

Therefore, you should expect, unless you talk to them beforehand, that the couple/bride may be offended if you show up in white. In addition, even if she doesn’t care, the other guests may think that you’re doing it to spite her, because actually, a not insignificant number of people *do* wear white to spite the bride. That's what I mean by upstaging - you're creating drama around yourself on someone else's big day, regardless of your intentions. Same reason why declaring your pregnancy/engagement at someone else's wedding is also rude.

If you want to wear something other than white at your wedding and/or tell your guests that light colors are fine, go for it, and feel free to encourage others to consider these choices for their weddings too. But a friend’s wedding is just not the time to be making a political statement. I would say, if you can’t abide by a dress code, explicit or implicit, even if it’s because it’s straight up bullshit (like, you know your conservative aunt is gonna be pissed if you as a woman show up in a tux, or the fucking. “women under 160 lbs wear orange sweaters and Louboutins, women over 160 lbs wear all black, men wear soda hats and purple fuzzy jackets, also you MUST spend $1000 on your outfit” post sdjfklsd) you should decline to attend rather than flout those expectations, unless you’re ready to burn that bridge.

I absolutely do not believe that anyone *has* to or should feel pressured to get married or care deeply about the ceremony, I agree with you it sucks and is deeply weird that we still push a big wedding as something little girls should aspire to. It’s just that a lot of people still do care a lot, and so I think it’s rude to decide to wear the **one** color that has a 90% chance of pissing off the people you’re there to celebrate. </TEXT>

The response I was most surprised about was that only 7.7% said you have to invite out-of-town guests to the rehearsal dinner, which is what I was raised on and I'm pretty sure the only opinion I've ever heard on the matter. If I had to spend a full day travelling I would expect an invite lol. I guess "out of town" is a bit subjective, but basically I'd say if they had to get a hotel room they should be invited.

I suppose it's also true that the hosts should get final say, but I think it's pretty poor etiquette to snub guests who had to come in from a different country, for instance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know tumblr isn't, like, "the LGBT community," but there was a lot of discourse about changing the acronym on there circa 2014 or so, and I believe this one was discounted entirely because a) it seems somewhat unclear if cis women are included under gender minorities (and if they're not, isn't that a little rude?) and b) most of the people caping for this one specifically wanted to include groups that were obviously... not related... to put it mildly (kink, literal pedos) under 'sexual minorities'. And then most of the other alternatives were also wildly controversial because of similar reasons, and also because it's not resolved within the intersex community if they should be included in all contexts.

People will be idiots no matter what umbrella term we use, I think it's more important to, for instance, fight against nonbinary exclusion in the LGBT community than to switch the acronym to increase inclusivity on a really surface level.

Also, personally, I like the term LGBT because it makes it harder to discount trans people. I find that a lot of the time people will discuss "qu//r" or "MOGAI" or "GSM" issues and what they're saying really only relates to one group. I think it's easier for people to notice they look like a clown if they say LG**BT** then only talk about things that impact gay people. That's just my opinion, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The very end of [La Vie Boheme](https://youtu.be/CddanmiakqM?t=466) from Rent?
>You? / Me. You? / Mimi...

edit: more options from google:

[Me You](https://youtu.be/nUYu7SFzhBQ?t=35) [San E ft. Baek Yerin, Kpop]
>Me you me you, me you me you it's you and / Me you me you, me you me you, it's you and / Me you me you, me you me you / It's you and me and you

[You Me and the Weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsQ3uBavYnc) [Hawksley Workman, I guess I'd call this indie pop rock or something]
>You me, you me and the weather / You me, you me and the storm / You me, you me here together / You me, you me safe and warm

[You and Me](https://youtu.be/6c8LA28O490?t=183) [Caroline's Spine, rock]
>You, me, you, me, you and me, you and me, yeah, you and you and you

Honestly it's very difficult to hear this part over the guitar though.

[I'm In Love](https://youtu.be/rqrXcNpzABY?t=135) [Agents of Good Roots, idk experimental light rock]
>I'm in love with a girl, she's in love with me...you...me...you...me...you...me...you...

A tune, timeframe, genre etc. would be very helpful.

As far as I can tell, Pat Monahan, the guy from Train, has not done anything with lyrics like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ahahaha, I actually pulled up the old eBoards from my health teachers to check which years we had sex ed. I checked the syllabuses too, which don't seem to have changed, and my memory is correct: the ONLY time lgbt people got mentioned was when talking about HIV, which isn't even legal in NJ, at least lgb people have to be mentioned, it's on the DoE website.

The health classes at my HS were a really mixed bag. It went like, reproductive anatomy/contraception/STDs, "nutrition," year off for driver's ed, then uhh "whatever the teachers felt like"

Senior year they actually covered a lot of practical things, even things you might not expect like how to recognize and deal with stalking, emotional abuse, addiction, as well as more generic stuff like reproductive health and pregnancy. Freshman year was slower and I think where they should have put consent/LGBT identities/healthy relationships. I think they may have mentioned those things for like one sentence apiece but I don't remember. Sophomore year was garbage, the ENTIRE time was spent on dubiously accurate and tangentially related documentaries like Supersize Me lmao. Actually all three years we spent a lot of time watching documentaries. Senior year they said fuck it and showed us, I think, Seinfeld? An episode where a character decided to "be a lesbian" briefly after a breakup but then quickly gets back with a dude and says it was a phase. Well, that's 2 contexts gay people got mentioned in - representation! the lgbt have rights now

Thanks for these repressed memories. I couldn't handle AP Research so I respect it, good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> That men are discriminated against in divorce proceedings. This was the case in the past, but now men actually are *more* likely to be awarded custody than women... when they ask for it. Most custody cases are not disputed and in amicable decisions, families are more likely to decide to give sole or primary custody to the mother.

In cases that are actually overseen by a judge, studies are somewhat hard to come by, probably for children's privacy reasons, but suggest they are awarded custody [just about half of the time.](http://amptoons.com/blog/?p=2080) (This is a blog but contains a relevant excerpt from a book.) A Massachusetts committee as far back as 1989 found that fathers might get it [*more* often](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-01-20-fi-22442-story.html).

<TEXT> I agree with this and I assumed this was the reason for the policy as well, because who’s getting more than 3 meals of takeout otherwise? At the same time they keep taking away options for how to use your excess mealswipes. I used to get fruit cups for myself and a bunch of cans to donate at Kilmer’s but now you can’t get that stuff with swipes. So then I started getting takeout for other people at the end of the semester and now they’re cracking down on that too?

Plus the no solicitation signs they put everywhere, not that it was really common beforehand but goddamn if I could give 20 swipes to the homeless every semester I’d do it in a heartbeat, what else am I gonna do with them? But the plans are too far apart for me to justify dropping down. It’s such a scam </TEXT>

<TEXT> hey, I'd like to give you a couple of comments if you don't mind

- the question is phrased in a leading fashion which might lead to an artificial increase in no answers. in addition, i think that most people who support the recitation of the pledge in schools still do not support *requiring* it, because that's currently extremely illegal and changing it would require either the supreme court to overturn WV BoE v Barnette or an amendment. pretty sure no one is that passionate about it so you might get 100% no even if it's not reflective of how much people like the pledge

- this sub is [very left-leaning](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/cuhpi4/results_political_compass_results_vs_ideology/) so even if phrased in a more neutral manner you should at least comment in your write-up that your sample population is not representative of the general public, and if you really wanted to go the extra mile you could attempt to roughly correct for it by asking people about their politics like a 3 or 5 option Likert scale and weighting their responses vs. the demographics of the general public from gallup or something. probably you dont care that much which is fine i wouldn't have done that either for a hs class but something to keep in mind administering surveys in general

- people usually don't like giving out their personal information so you may be limiting responses by requiring a name. if you have to administer it to your classmates and check if they all did it or something i would suggest having another version of the poll for the general internet

- you should restrict the demographic tag in your title to Americans 14+ years old

- also your age bins are huge lol the vast majority of people on here are like between 16 and 25 or so. i would suggest no more than 10 years up to 50+ </TEXT>

- when i hear what's your political party i think which party are you *registered to vote with*, not liberal vs conservative

- this sub is not even close to a representative sample if you're trying to extrapolate to voters. there are literally several times the number of communists than conservatives. if you're just interested in the sub there have been a lot of demographics surveys. you can get an idea from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/cuhpi4/results_political_compass_results_vs_ideology/) which is the most recent big one.

- should probably ask about nationality because overton windows vary </TEXT>

<TEXT> Aw man... I don't think anyone's going to be able to answer definitively based on this, there's got to be a dozen blogs just like that. coywolves comes to mind for me personally but honestly this could be like. Basically any horror blog on the whole website so F

- Did they use any unusual tags? Anything more specific than gore or horror? Tags with more than one word generally don't have that many posts. I got to the end of the night vision tag pretty fast, for instance, so you can look for posts by the person as well as go through the "people" tab at the top of the search. I'm sure you know this but you can multi tag search as well.

- If you didn't find them through a search, who put this person on your dash? If you don't remember exactly you can dig through the archives of similar blogs you follow or even ask them if they know who you're talking about. If you know for sure who you found this person from you can ask them to dig up any post you remember them reblogging, or do tag searches on their blog. Tumblr's blog search function is absolutely garbage, you can try it but tags are much better.

- When did you last look at this blog? No chance it, or the search/blog you found it from, is still in your browsing history? Sorry if this is too obvious lol I personally always forget this is an option until I've been looking for something for like an hour

- No chance you saved any photos from the blog for reverse image searches?

- Guesses about the url? If you can remember the first few characters you'll get 5 suggestions.

- Did they ever make original posts containing text? If you can remember a phrase they used or if there was anything in the description you can do an exact search for anything you can remember them saying.

- Did they have any other blogs and if so do you remember anything about them?

- Do you remember any blogs they reblogged from? If you can find a post you know they reblogged you can look through the notes.

- You said you looked through everything on your own tumblr - did you never like any of their posts? If you're sure you did and you can't find the blog ANYWHERE in your likes they've deleted, unfortunately. I have 54k likes so I know this option sucks ass unless you're very judicious with likes but it's one way to be sure.

Good luck </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look, I sub to r/childfree myself but whenever the topic of genetic disorders come up people go insane. I'm putting the removeddit links because I don't feel like dealing with people getting notified by totesmessengerbot and complaining but most of these are still up.

[Comment from the title](https://www.removeddit.com/r/childfree/comments/emty2x/_/fdrofep/)

["Technically speaking, there is nothing wrong with the overarching goal of wanting to create a genetically superior human species."](https://www.removeddit.com/r/childfree/comments/emty2x/_/fdsiway/)

["Eugenics is not an inherently bad idea. There will come a time where it will have to happen."](https://www.removeddit.com/r/childfree/comments/emty2x/_/fdrbwx1/) Removed, but before it got deleted was at +27 and the person [pointing out that this is ecofash bullshit](https://www.removeddit.com/r/childfree/comments/emty2x/_/fdrwvlr/) got downvoted to hell. Also of course they're an r/conservative user. The good parts of CF are discussions of reproductive autonomy and rethinking of ~family values~ which I thought neocons were supposed to hate but what the fuck ever.

["To be fair Eugenics gets a pretty bad rap because of it's association with Nazi Germany."](https://www.removeddit.com/r/childfree/comments/emty2x/_/fdt4rvs/) new comment and the thread is dying so only +1 but like. you think? do you think?

It's really funny because half of the comments are like "the twitter SJWs overreact SOOO MUCH by calling this eugenics it's not fucking eugenics" and the other half are like "hell yes let's do eugenics" like... can you at least look around

tl;dr this is a website </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't really think it's a matter of intensity... I'll give a description of how I use them but honestly the nuances here are very subtle with the exception of blunt, which is negative, like, indelicate.

Truthful is generally only applied to statements... if you're being truthful it just means you are telling the truth in that instance.

Upfront is mostly applied to honorably admitting faults honestly, like "I was annoyed about the delay but at least they were very upfront about it."

Unreserved is more of a synonym for uncontained... like you can dance unreservedly or something, but in the sense of an unreserved opinion is basically given without holding back criticism... a bit more polite than a blunt comment maybe. Don't hear this one too often.

Candid is pretty much = authentic. Candid photos are supposed capture unposed moments in people's lives. Probably has the most neutral connotation?

Honesty is similar to upstandingness, integrity. Imagining an honest person, they would never deceive someone for their own benefit, freeload, etc. because that's just not who they are. When used as "I'm being honest," depending on the tone of voice it could be a near exact synonym for either truthful or blunt. But the word honest by itself has a very positive connotation. I guess this would be the closest to 'intense'?

Forthright is like "straight out," I guess most similar to unreserved but not impolite at all. I have no idea if that makes any sense. Like if someone said "she was really forthright with me about it," without any further context I would guess that she had made a negative comment to the speaker but in a way that they weren't offended. Often used in the manner of "can you just be forthright about it," which is generally like, stop dancing around the truth.

Straightforward is not exactly a synonym for honest, if someone says something in a straightforward manner they made it simple to understand, and this is the sense I would usually assume without context. I guess in the sense of "be straightforward with me now," it's basically like, don't try to avoid the question.

But if you're just trying to say like, this person always tells the truth, or this statement was true, any of these except blunt, unreserved, and straightforward would give basically identical impressions. We could probably get rid of half these words TBH. Probably the only issue you would have with using them interchangeably would be with codified turns of phrase like honest work, honest to god... can't think of any with the other ones. If you have a specific context you would like to ask about feel free to shoot me a DM. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I do. Obviously some of the issues are different/unique and it's important to talk about all of them individually, but racism in our institutions and society is a shared struggle. I'm from the US, I think there's a very strong history there.

I feel like it's true that a lot of Asian-Americans and hapas don't really seem to care as much as you might expect about racial inequality, and even perpetuate stereotypes about other POC. I've noticed it in my own family unfortunately and that seems to be the general consensus with my Asian friends about their families also. It's difficult for me to gauge the younger generations, though, because my friends generally turn out to have very similar political beliefs to me regardless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will say that this sub is notoriously left leaning - I'm serious, it's more so than reddit at large, like a quarter of the people are [leftists](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/cuhpi4/results_political_compass_results_vs_ideology/) - so in general it's not a good place for polls like this. Actually I have no idea where you would post online to try to get a representative sample of the American electorate lol, you're always going to be talking to a pre-self-selected pool.

It might be better if you asked a full demographic battery and tried to adjust for it? Although that sounds like a hell of a lot of work. There's a reason even the professional pollsters don't always get it right. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm looking for a webcomic whose website lease probably expired. It had a title along the lines of "The many adventures of E??? [lastname]," not exactly that format, just something long-winded and vaguely similar.

The main character was a plain looking guy with a very round head and a big nose called Edwin or Edward or something like that, and he gets into weird and dangerous situations, and underreacts to them. The first couple of pages has aliens landing in a UFO and I think he talks them out of abducting him or something. The last arc that was still ongoing when the site went down or I just decided to unsubscribe for some reason in maybe 2016 had him and several other recurring characters trapped in a cannibal's mansion, running around between the rooms and experiencing cartoon violence basically.

The art was all in black and white, although I think the background was actually sepia not white. It had somewhat of an old-fashioned newspaper comic style but a little bit more detailed.

I swear to god this was in the recommendations section of a really popular humor webcomic like SMBC or something but I can't find it even after looking through everything else in my feed.

Thanks! </TEXT>

I can't think of anything off the top of my head that fits that description either. It's not Miamaska, Kill Six Billion Demons, or Earthsong, is it?

[*A three-panel comic. Each of the panels has a light grey background and the same set of about twenty hand-drawn, randomly placed teal and lavender dots. The first panel is labelled "**Knowledge**" and only has the dots. The second panel is labelled "**Experience**," and has the dots connected with branching horizontal and vertical lines. The last panel is labelled "**Creativity**," and has the dots connected in the shape of a cat.*]

The most important skill in the future will be the ability to "connect the dots" in your own way!

<TEXT> long as fuck post incoming! your girl is still pissed off about everything in this movie

honestly wasn't it already kind of weird in the first place? if my friend was like "hey should i date my ex's niece? i kissed her right after said ex's funeral," i'd tell them "what the fuck?"

you ask me, steve's ending in EG wasn't thought out at all. it would have made much more sense to switch steve and tony, it would have worked better for both of their character arcs, but either way it was pretty bad.

my issues with it are:

- steve rogers? just like, chill while everything in the 1950s-2000s in world history happened? including all the shit with hydra in shield and bucky being the winter soldier??? dude's just gonna let howard get assassinated? he's just going to chill throughout the civil rights movement, the cold war, vietnam??? chill so hard history doesn't know he's even alive again? unrealistic. no way this was the same timeline.

- also, if it was the same timeline it was definitely incest with sharon :( because of these reasons i'd prefer the different timeline explanation, but there are still big problems with that:

- if it WAS a different timeline, then he would have needed the pym particles to get back so he should have showed up on the platform old

- disrespectful to peggy as a person - I haven't actually watched agents of shield but getting the general idea from fan buzz about it, she chose to move on from him and get involved with Daniel. If it was a different timeline steve was basically like let me overwrite her life real quick

- also there was that WHOLE subplot about moving on from the past and adjusting to your present reality in TWS. personally i think this is more wholesome as a message than... whatever message literally going back in time to overwrite your own and someone else's past sends

- were there just two steves in that timeline??? did he just let himself languish in the ice for 70 years??? basically stealing the steve actually from that timeline's life??? fucked up

i have read a couple fanfic since EG that had steve go back to the past, have his dance with peggy, go on a mission with her to rescue himself and bucky, then dip back to the present to give sam the shield and retire, which fixes almost every single one of those problems, but russos said fuck making sense i guess!

also, why i think tony and steve should have been switched, their character arcs both had a similar theme where they did self destructive things in the name of trying to save other people. the difference was that it felt like tony was working towards building relationships to temper this tendency throughout the series, and almost fully resolved that before EG, settling down with pepper and morgan. i think that a quiet retirement would be a satisfying ending for him. however, steve throughout the series had progressively cut off or been cut off with many of his relationships - losing almost everyone he knew after catfa of course, then burning most of his new bridges throughout catws and cacw. then most of his remaining allies got dusted in IW. basically seemed like he was losing any grounding influence and it felt like he was being set up to go out with a bang. although because i like him i wouldn't be opposed to him getting a happy ending even though it might not make the most sense ever, they definitely did it in a way that pissed me off from the bottom of my heart.

i shouldn't be this invested at this point but i'm still really mad, i really liked these characters and literally no one got a conclusion that felt right! those weren't the only issues with endgame's writing, either.

the time travel mechanics were so bungled that all narrative tension was lost. once you realized - because they POINTED IT OUT - that they could just travel back for more Pym particles, it's like, OK cool, infinite supply and nothing you do can fuck up the future? there's no stakes.

bruce's character development all happened offscreen, the whole thing with clint and natasha was so weird, i can think of so many workarounds plus because they decided to axe clintasha that whole moment felt unearned, and then they didn't even hold a funeral for her or address clint's whole grimdark phase. neither of them got an overarching character arc at ALL which sucks because there was a lot of potential there! thor was turned into a fat joke, which was both stupid and made no sense narratively, and then i already went into how much i hated steve's ending. tony's was ... *alright* i guess but i was really in the theater like "okay" about how he died. it felt so contrived, there was no reason for the gauntlet to have been anywhere near thanos.

it really could have been great, but marvel knew they would make billions on it literally no matter what they put out, so they invested into making it flashy rather than good character writing. not to be dramatic and crotchety but it makes me pretty sad that this seems to be what cinema is going to look like for a long time if nothing changes because of how much damn money it makes. the big ensemble fight scenes are entertaining but a story really needs a heart at its core. many of the movies in the MCU do have that heart, but somehow they don't synthesize very well in the avengers movies. i don't think any of them, possibly even the original, are going to be considered movies with strong artistic merit or importance in twenty years' time in the way that movies like spiderverse and the original iron man will be.

in my opinion infinity war is also pretty unsalvageable but if i get into that i'm gonna be here until i die and that's even less relevant to your post so i'll just leave it at that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When people say 'get money out of politics' in the US anyway, they usually just mean overturning Citizens United, but our problems started way before that and you can point to problems caused by capitalism in literally any other country as well. Issues clearly connected to capitalism which would remain after even the most progressive campaign finance reform imaginable include the lobby/corporate/government revolving door, the fact that politics is simply easier to get into for the wealthy and well-connected (plus even if Citizens United is overturned it still costs a hell of a lot to run a campaign), and the way megacorporations can still throw their weight around even if they can't donate to campaigns, like how Amazon basically made cities shower them with benefits for the wonderful gift of job creation...

I think it is difficult for many people to see how closely intertwined industry and government are, but if you lay out a couple of the different labor struggles over the years and how all the gains we have won had to be won tooth and nail because of industry AND government opposition it becomes easier to understand. If our only issue is campaign finance (if this is indeed what your friend means by getting money out of politics), then why has the government so consistently showed up with the cavalry to break up the most persistent strikers? I just think that the consistent history of labor suppression by the US government suggests on its face that there are more issues at play, although I guess that's difficult to *prove*. There are probably parallel arguments to be made if you're elsewhere. </TEXT>

I had to call the registrar's office to make the change. It's just so dumb because it's obviously not beyond the last day to drop a class for *next semester,* someone forgot to update a parameter.

<TEXT> It's really annoying to try to find actual writing on this because they're subsumed in search engines by red scare bullshit, but this is honestly really similar to the traditional Marxist critique of the nuclear family. Kollontai wrote a lot about this, some of her pieces are [here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1921/theses-morality.htm) and [here](https://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1920/communism-family.htm). If you don't feel like reading all that, the main idea I'm looking at here is that childrearing should become more of a collective responsibility rather than being forced on individuals (especially, lbr, mothers). Of course this stuff was written in 1920s Russia so it's not totally applicable today but the general idea persists.

I would also recommend the book Kids These Days for a look at how the economy affects parenting and basically has turned it into a competition, gives a really good description of the development of the obsessive and status-conscious parenting style. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're calling a four-year-old 'toxic' what? "Why do we never question if the child has bad vibes?"

OP obviously doesn't need to enjoy this kind of living situation, and sure, she isn't obligated to have a relationship with her sister, but it's really wild to seriously suggest she disown a toddler.

You're allowed to not like little kids, I don't either. But I think we should have at least a little empathy for the fact that they don't know any better if they haven't been taught. TBH this attitude is why people think everyone who posts here is off the rails. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Nice survey! Unfortunately it's really hard to judge without context, like for instance a male voice saying bitch or dyke would get my hackles up a lot more. Tone of voice is really important too, I think even out of context when you hear someone swear or use a slur from across the room randomly you can often tell if they are saying it affectionately or not. I would definitely take it badly if someone said queer in a nasty tone of voice even if it's mostly reclaimed where I live.

I know that calling trans people traps is really bad, but since it's also a common word I wouldn't think to be offended unless I had heard the whole sentence, so I put unsure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it's a good idea to organize a general strike solely over the Internet. If only one or a few people in a workplace decide to go forward with it they're just going to get fired. We would really need many orgs for something like this to be successful. Although of course any individual can avoid shopping on Black Friday, that's not really helpful as individuals either.

I always see posts like this only maybe a month before the intended date, too. If we wanted to actually attempt to organize something like this in a decentralized fashion purely online (still think this isn't a great idea) several months of serious planning would be wiser. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm. This is a really weird collection of things to put together. I feel like the defining feature of the decade, looking back 50+ years from now like we (Americans lol) look at decades gone by, in snappy soundbites, you know: the roaring 20's, the great depression, WWII, post-WWII, the Cold War, neoliberalism... the defining characteristic will probably be the rise of neo-nationalism which I think is what you meant by neo-populism.

There are a lot of brands and culture stuff here... I REALLY hope Snapchat doesn't stay relevant for 100 years, and I don't think a type of movie really has the power to define a whole decade, aside from looking specifically at cultural history. The works that get taught in history classes either created or defined an artistic movement or were a driving factor in social change. Marvel movies... are not that, they're just action flicks IMO. I think that perhaps if anything ever changes we'll define the recent period as the reign of megacorporations, with Disney as an example, but that's not something that started this decade.

Stuff like CRISPR and the Higgs Boson are going to be important in their fields for a long long time, but I don't think most people really understand enough to care.

Then again I might be too young to know lol. I feel like the most recent decade we've transformed into "history history" rather than stuff that still feels like current events is the 80s and I wasn't around then. </TEXT>

Plus the original 4chan post is totally indefensible!!  "I insulted someone online and they got mad how DARE they?? don't they know being as rude as possible on purpose constantly is how you're supposed to act online," goddamn, 6000 people never learned that being really mean might get you cut out of groups? Honestly what the fuck? When you're talking to someone online, you're still talking to a person. Do they manage not to realize this or do they call every single person they talk to f*gs etc IRL too??? </TEXT>

[*A hardback book with a cream-colored cover, held open by someone wearing a silver-and-black-colored ring on their left ring finger. The pages are thin, you can faintly see more recipes through the left page and an ad for a canned tomato product through the right page.*]

###Elderberry Blossom Wine

1 gal. boiling water

1 qt. elder blossoms

3 lbs. sugar

1 lemon, thinly sliced

1 T. good yeast

[*A sketch of a wine bottle.*]

Put blossoms in a large kettle and pour water over them. Let stand 1 hour. Strain, add sugar to liquid, boil a little and skim. When lukewarm, add lemon and yeast. Let stand 24 hours, then strain and put into bottles or jugs, filling full until all impurities are worked out. Be sure to fill up jugs as fast as it works out and the wine will be a beautiful amber color. (In making this wine, be careful to keep all stems out, as they make the wine taste rank and give it a dark color.) Cork tightly.

###Communion Wine

20 lbs. grapes, cleaned, no stems

6 qts. water

6 lbs. sugar

[*A sketch of a simple Communion goblet.*]

Put grapes and water in stone jars over the fire and cook until the skins and seeds separate from pulp. Strain through cheese cloth and return to jars; add sugar, and mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Use absolutely no tin, iron or even silver about the wine. Strain again through fresh cheese cloth and put in jars over the fire. Do not boil hard, but allow it to heat gradually until it begins to simmer. Bottle at once.

###A Cranberry Drink

1/2 pt. cranberries

1/2 gal. water

1/2 lemon, peeled

1 oz. oatmeal

A little sugar

2 glasses wine

Put cranberries over the fire to boil. In another kettle, boil water, lemon and oatmeal for 10-15 minutes. Add cranberries and sugar - just enough so as not to take away the acid of the fruit. Add wine. Boil for 20 minutes, strain and serve cold.

###Blackberry Wine

1 gal. black berries

1 qt. boiling water

2 lbs. sugar

Bruise berries, add boiling water. Let stand 24 hours, stirring occasionally. Strain off the liquor and put into a cask. Add sugar; cork tight and let stand till next October, wh... will be ready for use. It may be bottle... [*A couple of letters are cut off by a finger.*]

###Cottage Beer

1 peck good wheat bran

3 handsful [sic] hops

2 qts. molasses

2 T. yeast

10 gal. water

Put wheat bran and hops into water, and boil until bran and hops sink to the bottom. Strain through a thin cloth into a cooler. When it is about lukewarm, add molasses. As soon as molasses is dissolved, pour all into a 10-gallon cask and add yeast. When fermentation is over with, cork up the cask and it will be ready in 4-5 days.

###Ginger Beer

6 oz. bruised ginger

3 qts. water

5 lbs. loaf sugar

1/4 lb. honey

A gill of lemon juice

17 qts. water

2 drachms essence of lemon (about 2 t.)

1 whole egg


Put ginger and 3 qts. water into a very large kettle and boil for 30 minutes. Add sugar, honey, lemon juice and 17 qts more water. Strain through a cloth and when it is cold add essence of lemon and egg. Let stand for 3-4 days before bottling.

###Spruce Beer

2 oz. hops

1/2 gal. water

8 gal. warm water

1 gal. molasses

4 oz. essence of spruce

1 pt. water

1/4 pt. yeast

Put hops and water in a kettle and boil for 30 minutes. Strain; add 8 gallons warm water, molasses and spruce essence. Put in a clean cask, shake together and add in yeast. Let stand and work for 6-7 days, or less if the weather is warm. When drawn off, add 1 t. molasses to each bottle.

*Due to the popularity of cars, and therefore people being able to travel farther from their homes, motels had been around since 1925. They were called bungalows, and pretty much consisted of a little wooden shack with a bed in it. There was outdoor plumbing and that was about it. But at least you didn't have to drag a tent along.*

60 mL boiling water

320 mL packed brown sugar

240 mL (2 sticks, 225g) 65% vegetable oil spread, room temperature

1 egg

720 mL quick or old-fashioned rolled oats (if using old-fashioned oats, add 30 mL flour)

300 mL flour

3.5 mL teaspoon salt

2.5 mL teaspoon baking soda

1 package (225g) milk chocolate toffee bits (about 320 mL)

360 mL semisweet chocolate chips

240 mL coarsely crumbled sugar cones (about 5 cones)

Line cookie sheets with parchment paper or non-stick foil, or use non-stick cookie sheets.

Preheat oven to 182 degrees.

Dissolve coffee in boiling water; cool to room temperature. In large bowl, beat brown sugar and vegetable oil spread on medium speed of electric mixer until creamy. Add egg; beat well. Beat in coffee and vanilla. Combine oats, flour, salt and baking soda; mix well. Gradually add to creamed mixture, beating well after each addition. Stir in toffee bits, chocolate chips and sugar cones.

<TITLE> [Online][2017?] Casual get-15 game </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-10-20 23:14:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> **Platform(s):** Browser

**Genre:** Puzzle

**Estimated year of release:** 2014-2017

**Graphics/art style:** Minimalist

**Notable characters:** N/A

**Notable gameplay mechanics:** Place same-numbered blocks together to merge into a higher number, get to 15 before you run out of room

**Other details:** Looked very similar to 2048 - 5x5? grid on which colored tiles with numbers appeared, each number had its own color. The color palette was slightly muted.

You started off with a couple tiles of ones and twos, if you placed three or more of the same number adjacent to each other, they would merge to make the next number up. 2? new tiles spawned in addition to the one you had to place each turn, and you lost when you ran out of room.

Definitely not the Famobi game, although they are really similar. The board started out mostly empty, and there wasn't an app as far as I know.

It had its own website. I'm pretty sure the name was something along the lines of Get 15! or Make 15! or something like that. Or maybe Get 10 and then if you won, it told you to try to get to 15 and so on. I've tried looking this up several times but unfortunately all the variants of the name I could think of are super generic.

I was obsessed with this a couple of summers ago but it might have been a little older. Guessing not by much because it was almost certainly inspired by 2048.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see what you mean, just thought that it was questionable to lump in 'single and not looking' with 'actively dating' purely for the purposes of this study, because I'd guess people who are actively dating probably score better than those who aren't. Actually went and read the study this time instead of just the article lol and they did split it up later on, but the sample sizes for the subgroups were just really small. The not-dating singles were also only n=32...

It would make the results more meaningful IMO if they were able to control for the differences between completely single, casually dating, divorced, and widowed individuals, but they did acknowledge this was a weakness. Maybe they'll do a follow up. </TEXT>

I guess I'm still not 100% CF because I'd be open to adopting an older kid if I had an SO that was important to, but it was a no on adopting a baby as soon as I got a complete description of that too.

<TITLE> help with transitioning to index fingers? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-10-17 05:21:45 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi guys,

I'm a casual player of a few months. I have been using thumbs only but I feel like I'm stagnating and everyone seems to say that it's easier to play with index fingers. Well, I've been giving it a try for the past couple of days and it still is a lot harder than thumbs - I feel like my fingers' response time is a lot slower and a little less precise, although it is definitely easier to cover a large distance quickly like that. I usually play 11-13 charts but I've been having to do more like 8-10 with fingers and still having trouble. I'm playing on an iPhone.

I guess a couple questions for people who have switched from thumbs to index: is it still slower even after you get used to it, and you're doing a tradeoff for accuracy? Or is it the same after you've practiced a while? How long did it take for it to click? And last, is using multiple fingers common, and if so when is that appropriate? I tried that for some fast tap sections and it was even worse than trying to do it with just index fingers dfjskfjlsjkd.

One more thing, any tips for a way to place/hold the phone that's comfortable? Sitting over it looking straight down is killing my neck lol. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If want to do research you can always reach out directly to professors who are doing work you find interesting, you can also do this through programs like Aresty and if you're in Douglass project Super.

TBH as long as it's not a super frivolous or politically contentious extracurricular it will look good, especially if you go for leadership positions. Even if you just do research and join the eboard of one or two of the clubs you're already in, that's plenty. I don't know you but I tried to join like 5 clubs freshman year and burned out REAL quick.

That being said, you can search clubs at GetInvolved. A lot of overachiever type students go for student government - RUSA, EGC, etc., but I think their elections are over (maybe not for freshmen? idk). I don't know an awful lot but they do stuff like manage pretty big budgets and organize a lot of events that I'm sure are great resume bullet points. </TEXT>

I basically just explained the situation, mentioned that I didn't get notified until I already had like 10 and they stickered my car, because it was the old plates in the system. I added documentation of the plates change. Idk what the deciding factor was there but it worked.

Whatever your case, don't bother going to the office, they straight up refused to talk to me in person, you have to just use the citation portal. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree. I ended up not finishing the survey. My actual vote if forced to decide IRL would depend on:

- how sure I am about the results (might cast a protest vote if I know with like 95% certainty mine won't matter anyway, living in a deep blue area and state)

- how much I think both parties are just paying lip service to the other side

- exactly how bad the bad take(s) from the democrat were (big difference between something like 'Abortion is a sin but I'll respect Roe v Wade' - not ideal, but ultimately can be overcome by the rest of the platform, and 'my top priority during my term will be to outlaw abortion,' for example).

I would 100% vote Republican if the Republican in a race were genuinely more liberal overall than the Democrat, but those types of candidates don't really seem to exist these days. I can't see myself voting single-issue even on the issues dearest to me unless the Dem had an absolutely nuclear take on something.

Also, I feel like although this survey is already long it'd be useful to know where survey takers actually stand on the issues mentioned. There's some daylight between "this isn't important enough to make me switch" and "actually I don't agree with my party on this in the first place," but both would lead to the same response. </TEXT>

It might be a little difficult to join competitive clubs at this point - the last day to turn in rock climbing club dues was last week for instance - but I can't think of any other reason why someone would tell you no, a lot of clubs would be cool with it if you showed up smack dab in the middle of the semester. Actually as someone on a club e-board we're really hoping more people show up to our second meeting sdjfkldsjlkds. If you're not already on the mailing list of any clubs you are interested in, reach out to some club leadership people to check in about when/where they meet and if you missed anything important.

If it turns out nothing fits in your schedule or something like that it's 100% normal to join a club spring semester as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> man he's not gonna subscribe to you for writing like all these defensive comments...

so TELL me what nuance i'm missing. you added context but not anything that actually changes the truth value of what i said. for absolute clarity, these are the arguments i intended in the parent content, which was written like that because the intended audience was people familiar with and who agree with all these arguments:

- felix has said and done antisemitic things, even if it was just as a joke, and issued insufficient apologies and insufficient denunciation of the reactionary element that came out of the woodwork to defend his "free speech" (which seems to have mostly meant how he got dumped by Disney, a private company, which is just a little bit hypocritical, but that's besides the point), which has been defending him ever since and which seems to think he's one of them as demonstrated in the supportive tweet in the OP by noted actual neo-nazi stonetoss

- reactionaries started to defend him *because* of problematic things he said and not because they just so happened to think his gaming content was very cool all along. back in ~2013 most of the internet thought he was just kind of a cringy derivative gaming Youtuber. You're free to disagree with this assessment, that wasn't the main thrust here, but the fact of the matter is he wasn't popular among reactionaries until recently.

- many people in the alt-right use support of him as a guise to push their own agenda, even though, as previously mentioned, i suspect they may not even genuinely like his content. and he, again, has not done enough to discourage this. whether this is because he agrees with them in his heart of hearts or just likes the income from their clicks, i have no idea and again don't really care.

- and lastly, this is highly successful because more reasonable fans like you and the other responder might believe the smokescreen because you DO genuinely like his content, and then might do something like share a video called "Pewdiepie is NOT a Nazi," which has a shitton of white supremacist dogwhistles in it, like the ones from Rebel Media and Sargon of Akkad.

i wrote a lot more but this is becoming a short novel so i'll just respond to a few of your points, which again, had nothing to do with what i said.

desperately need a source on no Logged In antiracists actually achieving anything... you know BLM was mostly organized over twitter, right? i never claimed to have personally achieved anything in this regard. this is a comment on an antiracist sub, if racists see it that's their own goddamn fault. i avoid saying anything in bigoted online spaces specifically because i'm very aware of the backfire effect.

"so much for the tolerant left" is really annoying because [no one ever claimed to be tolerant of bigots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance). being tolerant of different races is, like, the opposite of tolerating *racists*.

keemstar is absolutely hot garbage but i made the comment about pewdiepie, because the post, is about pewdiepie.

i never said he was evil or irredeemable or unforgivably racist, although using the n word was definitely a very bad look that belies at least some subconscious racism. all he would need to do to get leftists off his back is to say look, i don't want racists in my audience, unsubscribe from me, i know i've said things that were racist, but that was out of ignorance, i'm sorry, i've learned and i don't want hateful people defending me, i know that by being silent it may have looked like i supported bigotry, but i don't, i'll do my best to be better moving forward. and then follow through. that's it! it's not that hard! ik he's apologized... but here he is sucking up to antisemites 2 days ago. hard to believe he's actually learned

not gonna respond to further comments on this thread. i've said everything i want to. if you'd like even more leftist commentary on the situation, watch the 2-part video series i linked earlier. i'm not just making shit up here, there is a real problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ok i guess i lied about not replying lol

Bad phrasing, the majority of his audience is normal - dude's got what, 100 million subscribers? - just there SURE are a lot of white supremacist adjacent types who really like him, and I think he should take responsibility not to throw these little winks at them and in fact to make it clear to them that they're not wanted, if in fact he doesn't want them.

I really do try my best not to make hurtful jokes. I mean, this was a joke ragging on pewds but it's not like he's going to see it. I first of all usually don't find them funny and second of all it's important to me that no one decides to lose faith in me as an ally by indicating that I think their oppression or suffering is funny. A lot of people say that this is "virtue signalling" but the truth of the matter is that making Holocaust puns or gay Trump jokes or 200 genders jokes is also sending a signal. It's not so much that comedy can't touch certain topics, more like you need to be careful how you approach it, to avoid alienating the innocent and attracting the less savory. Like, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvgZtdmyKlI) a sketch I think is really good about Nazis.

Like I said, I don't really think he's some kind of deeply ideological white supremacist himself. He has just made several very public mistakes in this direction and hasn't done enough to discourage those people who think he's one of them.

50k as a flat amount is a lot, sure, but he made $15 mil in 2016 (couldn't find a more recent stat), so that's like someone making 50k a year donating $166. I'm an anticapitalist so that's where that comment was coming from, I have the same complaint about all multimillionaires. </TEXT>

<TEXT> dude, you can't call for genocide against a group that's had a genocide carried out against it within the past 100 years as a joke. edgy comedians are just as at fault for it. both people in the audience who are affected by the issue at hand and real extremists are going to see it as a reflection of, if not support for their views, support for their right to exist/hold those views. this is a very simple concept and i don't trust anyone who won't cut it out very quickly after they first realize this, and this guy KEEPS making problematic jokes across his whole internet career.

i was satirizing him but just BARELY, i paraphrased "death to all jews" which he literally PAID some guys to say, verbatim, those were the words he made them write, as "i hate jews," and the "haha jk... unless..?" addition was a joke about how he gave a milquetoast apology but then continued to court a largely alt-right fanbase. i thought it was clear i wasn't quoting him, because "haha jk... unless?" is a meme right now. i believe he also threw a heil hitler salute also "as a joke"?

no, the iron cross isn't exclusively a hate symbol, but that's a very popular usage. in addition, the plausible deniability makes it VERY VERY popular among Logged In fash - you see it all over fascist tumblr and twitter - I would guess the sweatshirt was produced as merch for bikers or something but I'll eat my hat if Felix doesn't know goddamn well the implications and is (successfully!) sucking up to fash in his audience, while not doing anything his more moderate fans can't defend. see: stonetoss, literal actual fascist cartoonist, whose tweet you are looking at right now, who clearly very much thinks it's neat.

i don't really care if he intended any of these things as some kind of 3D chess antifa meme (which i EXTREMELY doubt), the effect is clearly to embolden and validate nazis. i actually kind of doubt that Felix in his heart is a nazi, i think he's probably more of a useful idiot, and as you said only trying to be edgy. however, the way he platforms actual nazis (he once gave a [shoutout](https://www.vox.com/2018/12/13/18136253/pewdiepie-vs-tseries-links-to-white-supremacist-alt-right-redpill) to a white supremacist channel) and makes it easier for them to recruit from the already alt-lite-heavy pool of the online gaming community, is really bad, and the conversations surrounding him and about him are constantly really really bad, which was more of my point in the parent comment.

the contents of his soul are less important to me than the fact that even after a mass murderer told people to subscribe to him, he CONTINUES to pull shit like go back on his word to support an anti-hate group. it just looks bad. He's worth $61m so the pledged 50k is almost a token gesture and he said sike on even that much bc he has to pacify the raging antisemites in his audience. if he's not making shit up about not liking the ADL which tbph... could be fair...?? then he'll donate it to a different anti hate group. i have a lot of doubt this will come to pass, because that would piss off his audience too. even if he does it doesn't invalidate the fact that he's caused a lot of hurt and even now is thoughtlessly or worse spreading a symbol used by Nazis.

i think you're engaging in good faith, i know it isn't comfortable to absorb criticism of your favorite creators, but it seems we're talking at cross purposes and these responses take me longer than i'd like to write so i will not respond in depth further. any remaining points i would like to make have been made very well in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmRYRRDbuw) from noncompete. </TEXT>

<TEXT> its been said plenty but it’s very interesting how internet chucklefucks went from hating his guts because his “sense” of “humor” and his fake scream melodrama shtick are super annoying, to suddenly thinking he’s very cool and his critics are big meanies, all within the span of a couple of months... and that this was coincidentally around the time he started saying “i hate jews.... haha jk... unless...?”

kind of makes you think maybe none of the conversation about him from the right is in good faith, but luckily no one would ever do something like make up a whole opinion they don’t even believe and spend hours arguing for it as a more palatable thinly veiled proxy for white nationalism or anything like that :\^) because literally no one would ever fall for that, right? :\^)))

<TEXT> Oh, you've hit one of my favorite talking points jskdlfjdslkss sorry about the text wall. This is pretty US-centric but I'm sure if you're outside the US you can find some good and more relevant examples.

It's not really that communism and feminism are incompatible, rather that communism and liberalism are, and liberal and even reactionary feminists exist. Personally I think that invested intersectional feminists already understand class-based analysis and they just have to be convinced that reformism won't ever end oppression (this is actually how I became a leftist), so talking to them isn't a bad idea. As long as we have to operate within capitalism, we have pretty similar goals as well.

As for your questions, I think it's important to call out sexism in leftist spaces, there's nothing contradictory about applying feminist ideas to the orgs or even online spaces you're in. Also, imo committed feminists are as close to radicalization as it's possible to be within liberalism, and you can try to talk to them about a more Marxist analysis of topics they find important. If you'd like to try to convince them, here are tips just based on what I personally found very convincing as a liberal feminist:

- Point out the ways in which liberal feminism fails to help people they claim to care about, like how woke brands (tm) often exploit workers both domestically and abroad, or how even "progressive" politicians they like generally have imperialist foreign policy, and how plenty of them will sell out due to the way liberal democracy is basically plutocracy. I became very anti-nationalist and anti-imperialist during the 2012 primary season because I was made very aware of Obama's war crimes. Once someone starts paying attention to how consistently western liberal parties do this it can be demonstrated to them how the system is designed for that and then it's easier to talk to them about anticapitalism, and once you understand why capitalism is bad you're basically there.

- You can also point out how even the most progressive politicians are actually garbage, like how FDR literally put US citizens in concentration camps. Bring up how capitalism perverts democracy whenever progressives compromise the values they were elected for claiming to have.

- Give examples of successful policies and systems in socialist/anarchist/etc societies to chip away at the "communism evil" kneejerk reaction. It's a good idea to avoid "___ did nothing wrong" rhetoric when talking to liberals, instead point out things like improved quality of life after the Cuban revolution, and tie anticommunism to anti-imperialism, which is pretty easy considering all the coups pulled against duly elected leaders like Allende and Mossadegh.

- Also make sure to continue talking about the things liberal feminists and socialists agree with, which is generally domestic policy re: minority rights.

You don't *have* to argue with liberals by any means, but an intersectional feminist is way more likely than a generic Biden stannie type liberal to engage in good faith. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know if you'd want to change it again, but you might want to consider asking instead which party better represents your beliefs? Some people frequently switch their affiliation to strategically vote in primaries - most people in my family do it. This is still a perfectly valid research question - the amount of people who do that might not be statistically significant, although I personally think it's kind of silly not to? - but rewording it might dig more into what I think you're probably more interested in, the ideological tendencies. </TEXT>

Yes you can run it again! Might be better to say cantaloupe and honeydew rather than orange and green melon just so there's no possible confusion. I wouldn't expect there to be a correlation with pumpkin or zucchini, but if you're curious, go ahead. I also kind of doubt there would be an effect from country.

The yes/no is definitely easier to run correlation on, but a 5-point Likert scale would also be appropriate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> All the commenters saying you should keep it secret, that you'll just be mucking up your relationship for literally no reason unless you want to open it or something, I'm guessing most of them haven't lived as closeted for decades... the emotional toll is pretty bad. I feel anxious all the time and have some serious repression issues because of it. OP, not saying your experience is like that, but the point is that people demanding you stay in the closet for her sake aren't weighing this properly. The only reason for her to feel betrayed is if she's biphobic, in which case, as a bystander, my feeling is, then so what?

Unless you think your wife will take it really badly, it's also a terrible idea NOT to come out to her first, before any of your friends or other family, if that's something you want to do. That would actually be a legitimate slight, I think.

OP, you know your wife better than anyone here. If you feel safe coming out to her and if you want to, then go for it. You deserve to feel like you don't have to keep secrets from your SO. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi, in addition to the other comments people have made I think the question about "how many genders are there" is only answerable in the short form if your answer is "two," which isn't going to be the case for the vast majority of the LGBT community. I put a bit of a long-winded response, but I think the question is flawed, because the modern definition of gender is intrinsically not discrete at all. </TEXT>

There is a large main header, and below are three white boxes side-by-side containing smaller text, above each of which is a subheading. There is a drop shadow behind the boxes to make them look a bit like they are jutting out over the orange background, much like the placards placed next to artwork in museums. In the bottom right corner, there is a drawing of a snarling gorilla's head with green eyes. The main header reads:*]

#3 WAYS TO WRITE A MUSEUM WALL LABEL WHEN THE ARTIST IS A SEXUAL PREDATOR

[*The first subheading, starting from the left, reads:*]

##For museums afraid of alienating billionaire trustees and collectors who donated the artist's work

[*The first box*:]

###Chuck Close

American, born 1940 Monroe, Ohio

***Portrait of President Bill Clinton,*** 1992

oil on canvas

National Portrait Gallery, Washington DC

Chuck Close is one of the most important artists of his generation, and the creator of a new kind of portraiture consisting of patterns of color.

[*The second subheading:*]

##For museums conflicted about disclosing an artist's abuse next to his art

[*The second box:*]

###Chuck Close

American, born 1940 Monroe, Ohio

***Portrait of President Bill Clinton,*** 1992

oil on canvas

National Portrait Gallery, Washington DC

Chuck Close is one of the most important artists of his generation, and the creator of a new kind of portraiture consisting of patterns of color. Like many artists, he has had a few disgruntled employees.

[*The last subheading:*]

##For museums who need help from the Guerrilla Girls

[*The last box:*]

###Chuck Close

American, born 1940 Monroe, Ohio

***Portrait of President Bill Clinton,*** 1992

oil on canvas

National Portrait Gallery, Washington DC

Chuck Close has had a huge career with prices to match. He has been accused of sexually abusing models, and students he picked up at fancy art schools. How fitting and ironic that he painted the official portrait of Bill Clinton. The art world tolerates abuse because it believes art is above it all, and rules don't apply to "genius" white male artists. WRONG!

[*In very small text to the left and right of the gorilla head in the bottom right:*]

<TEXT> I've read this but I can't find it either. Here's a more complete summary in case it helps people search:

It was a Twine game with two main paths. As the OP states you're a lantern, and the lanterns are critical to keeping the town safe in the darkness. The mayor comes out to the path sometimes and tells you how important you are. You're the longest-lasting lantern, the rest come and go but tend to burn out quickly.

There are knights that pass through the town occasionally, and one day you get taken into the woods by a strange, dark knight. In the first ending, you get attacked by this beast of myth in the woods and the knight saves you, and she gives you bits of her clothes or something as you walk back to town and you get the sense she's really not human, and that maybe you are. Back in town, you find out that yes, the lanterns are children altered through some form of magic, and you were the mayor's own child. You can choose whether to kill the mayor or not, and either way the knight destroys the town and you both leave.

In the second path, the knight turns out to be the beast, and you go to this deep hole inside a tower in the woods where the town puts all the lanterns that died. I don't remember this part as well but she throws you down the hole and you die. There might be an option to bring her down with you.

The writing style is intentionally like a fairy tale, and the art style for the illustrations was scratchy. </TEXT>

The reason white racism is increasing is because this generation of young white men were raised to be the least racist generation of whites to ever exist in the history of this planet. We grew up being taught that racism was bad, that we were ALL going to move past it and work together towards a better future. Even here in the most traditionally racist part of the country, nearly every young white boy in my generation grew up watching black athletes, black actors, listening to black musicians, etc. It was all normal. We were 95% post-racial.

So as we got older, we stuck our hands out in friendship to EVERYONE, like we'd been taught to... and then every nonwhite group on the planet came by and sucker-punched us from behind, called us evil white devils, and told us we deserved to die. We were ready and willing to move on from the past, the rest of you weren't. Instead of shaking our hands and marching off together, you chose revenge against the only white people who've ever let their guard down.

So now you's cant be our friends, and we're reforging the identity we were taught to shed.

How many times have I gone into a bar hoping for a dependable selection of beers I can trust and instead being forced to choose this locally brewed artisanal nonsense (80% of which are IPAs which I detest) like it were Stalin's Russia or Bernie's America?

Nation's that were colonised are economically doing better that places that werent. In fact there is a significant correlation between being colonised for longer and standard of living found today. Look no further that Haiti, never colonised and one of the most impoverished countries.

<TEXT> It's insane that even now, when AI inheriting bias from the people who train it has come up over and over even in national news, that so many programmers still don't give a shit about whether their AI is OBVIOUSLY going to systematically discriminate against vision impaired and autistic people! Not to mention that AI can come up with associations that you never intended. Do people rate nonwhite people as less enthusiastic on average, which would probably affect whatever they used to train their algorithm? I don't know, but it sounds plausible and I doubt they cared to check!

Eye contact and enthusiasm and all that sort of first-impression stuff has absolutely jack shit to do with suitability or competence for most jobs anyway. One pro of automating interviews, if the people doing it gave a damn about ethics, would be that you could take those metrics OUT, could reduce bias. What the hell is wrong with these people? </TEXT>

I think GNC women are probably the most obvious group that wlw and straight dudes will disagree on, same for the corresponding survey for men.

My opinion is that it's a totally backwards viewpoint that has seriously inhibited society, to the point that tolerating people who believe bigoted things like that is a huge mistake, even if they don't openly say so, or even if they only believe it on a subconscious level but their actions reflect a sexist understanding of the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're going to get responses broken down entirely by political party, and also you should probably note that the population on here is not in any way reflective of a random sample of Americans, even less so of a world population.

The phrase "too sensitive" is very much associated with conservatism at this point, so if you're trying to collect data untainted by that association you will need to significantly reword. I am not sure what exactly you are looking for, but my suggestion would be to split it up into three questions along the lines of "do you think the average American is moving left, right or neither?" "what political party do you associate most with?" and "do you think that average Americans are becoming more polarized politically?" </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT][Movie][2005ish?] Woman eats spiky black thing, turns into a monster </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-07-12 20:37:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I caught just one scene of this movie when I was a kid, around 2005-2007, although it was playing on TV so the movie itself could be older. Anyway I was quite traumatized by it and I'm still kind of curious what the context of this scene was. In it, this woman, I think she was a brunette, is talking to a disembodied voice, or a computer, or something like that, in an all-white room. The voice convinces her to take this spiky... thing, that it offers up on a little platform. It looked sort of like a sweetgum burr, same shape and size, except it was black and shiny. She eats it, or swallows it, and it makes her turn into some kind of monster, and then she proceeds to attack a group of guys who I guess were also in the room. I think one of the guys was her love interest, and he tries to talk her down or something.

My memory is very hazy but I would guess that the female actor was in her late 20s and the guys were a little older. I got the sense that this was more an action/horror drama moreso than a straight horror work. It's also possible that it was from a TV show rather than a movie, I guess, although I've always felt convinced it was a movie for some reason... something about how the lighting and set were done, maybe? </TEXT>

All in all as a gay student I do feel like there are a lot of resources available and Rutgers goes out of their way to make things easier. Like, they help with trans healthcare, there's specifically SJE counselors for free CAPS advising, it's very easy to change the name on your ID and class rosters, they help with housing for trans students, and there's a decent amount of LGBT programming and clubs available.

It's sort of hard to say to what extent it's a gimmick, administration definitely uses Rutgers' diversity as a marketing tool, and I'm sure that was at least partially the motivation for some of the things they do. But in the end they have set up some really good programs staffed with people who genuinely care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's like... it's not vision... sorry I don't know how to explain it. Let's write a full essay in your nice clean comments section!

No, I don't think I'm the pinnacle of imagination, I have a hard time picturing fine details like texture and if people literally can voluntarily hallucinate, then I am obviously a scrub. But I'm just thinking, if you came up to me and asked me these questions, like, "picture someone you know standing next to me," I'd be like, ok, and if you asked "are you seeing them?" I'd be like, yeah, because there's a lot of overlap in the way we talk about visualizing and actual vision, and I can imagine their face and hair and clothes and everything, but it's like... on a separate level? Than your literal field of vision. Vision is just a very, very close metaphor for it so I worry that your survey takers may not have all differentiated the two the same way.

To answer "where it is" feels very difficult... like, it's in my mind? I know that sounds like a cop-out but that's what it is. I guess it is... kind of... a "separate vision" ... like on a layer in a digital drawing, but the transparency is so high you can't actually see ...? it??? I tried doing the visualizing stuff in my real environment since you described it in your post, it seemed like fun, and I can do it to an extent, but that's not normally what I do.

Trying to understand where you're coming from, can you not hear songs, or voices, in your head either? To me, that's probably the best way I can describe it... if you know a song well, you can 'hear' all the instruments, if you know a person's voice well you can imagine them saying whatever you want, hell usually when I'm thinking I 'hear' my own voice, but you're not actually using your ears for it, it's coming from inside your head, it's a totally different sensation.

This feels like trying to describe a whole sense to someone who's never had it, like it's just making me feel stupid sadjkldsj "what's it like picturing things?" "um... you picture it... like, in your mind... like you imagine it... kind of like sight but with your brain instead of your eyes" sorry for the poor explanation but I've been sitting here for like 45 minutes now and can't come up with better. But this is the issue, I think the people you interviewed may have failed to properly communicate what they were experiencing to you, because it's not something we really have developed language for yet.

I think it would be really neat if there was anyone at all out there who could do all that! But I think your numbers for that are so high, that if they were accurate, it would be common knowledge that such a thing was possible, and it seems like everyone on your post is confused about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I... have a REALLY hard time believing people are able to like... photoshop their actual real life vision like that. Like, I think maybe because it's so hard to describe visualization to someone who can't do it there is some form of miscommunication going on here, but I just feel like I would have heard of it if people could imagine that fantastically? I have full-color visualization ability, I can even do some of the open eye things, but it's not a change in your actual visual field... I'm not sure if people with aphantasia can have a song stuck in their head, but it's just like that, but with vision. You couldn't ever mistake it for something literally in your environment.

At any rate I appreciate that you literally walked up to people and asked them about this stuff in the pursuit of science, but that's an extraordinary claim and I would have to see a more rigorous academic study to believe it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While I think most political surveys with this Likert scale have the same issues, I had issues answering a few questions like, should criminals get tougher punishments? Hard yes for white-collar criminals and sexual offenders, hard no for things like drug crimes and stupid shit that lands a lot of people in prison like minor traffic laws, vagrancy, etc. And should the government have more or less influence on our day-to-day lives? Well I think they should stop doing things like spy on civilians, stop-and-frisk, and assigning half the police force to give out parking tickets, which is what I currently think of when it comes to government influence in my life, but I think it should provide more comprehensive public support and regulation in various spheres, which would bring many people in contact with the government more frequently.

Of course, issues like this will always crop up with Likert responses, but I think concepts as broad as "government" "crime" or "morality" can be interpreted as generally good or bad by the same person at different moments, especially when you have to go back and forth between answering questions about society as it is and your ideal society.

In these cases I usually just answer how I can sort of tell is expected of me but sometimes I realize later I interpreted questions the wrong way based on, like, what I've read recently.

This is extremely long-winded, sorry. Nice survey, please post results. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The section where you group life events is confusing. Wouldn't it be easier to have people just tell you the age when they did each event or n/a?

Also, for that section it's not super clear if it's still supposed to be things that happened when you were 18+. You could plausibly adopt a pet, buy a car, or even move out while still underage.

Last thing, it asked me how many times I did 'none,' which I just didn't answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would just write on topics you're passionate about, I don't really know how to be Internet famous nor do I follow blogs like yours, but you can usually tell if someone is writing to drive clicks or because it was an essay they really wanted to write, and I think most people prefer the latter. Have you done research? People LOVE psychological research. Also, I think it would be useful and I would personally be interested in discussions of widely-discussed psychological phenomena that aren't really backed by good research, there was that big scandal a few years ago about how like... a ton of highly cited psych studies aren't actually replicable. That's just me, though.

I will say that one thing guaranteed to get people to smash that like is anything fandom-related, but don't shoehorn it in if that's something you're totally disinterested in. Like, I posted a video related to an obscure Broadway fandom on tumblr last week asking if anyone knew the source and got like 75 reblogs with zero effort (no one answered the question, though...) </TEXT>

Someone offering to pay donors back helps me believe they're not a scammer, but I would still be pretty surprised if I actually did get paid back, no matter who the person was or what they said. I guess I'm just not your target audience because I can't see myself using this kind of p2p loan platform, but I think a lot of people conceptualize their loans in a similar way.

<TITLE> YA book about a girl and her clairvoyant rabbit </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-06-30 01:17:44 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I keep trying to find this book and am starting to feel like maybe I made it up out of whole cloth. It's about a girl, maybe in middle school, who finds this rabbit and convinces her parents to let her keep it. I'm fuzzy on the details but she finds out that it can predict the future, I think by realizing that it gave her winning lottery numbers. There's a brief scene where she mentions that the right word for that is clairvoyant, which I'm pretty sure is how I learned that word... She tries to keep it a secret which stresses her out a lot, I think she's worried that people will want to use the power in immoral ways, but eventually her family does find out. She has at least one sibling and I think two parents, but they might be divorced. I don't remember the plot, but I think it was a kind of generic coming-of-age where there's conflicts with your classmates and family which are ultimately resolved, kind of thing.

I might have this confused with another book but I seem to remember that she's learning to play the trombone, but she's a bit too short for it so she can't hit the lowest notes. Her dad is involved with this subplot somehow, like he also plays or inspires her not to give it up or something. There's a scene in both the beginning and end where she practices in her bathroom for some reason. If half of this description sounds familiar but not the other, still please comment!

I read this like 9-11 years ago, when I was somewhere in the 4th-6th grade age range. I got it from the library and it was relatively new at that point. I'm picturing the cover as like her holding the rabbit but it's close up on him so you can't see her face. I think the rabbit's name is something like Owen, maybe not exactly that but it was along those lines, not a cutesy name. It can't be the new Cynthia Lord book because of the timeframe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What genre and setting is the novel? All of these are definitely out-there and I would suggest changes if you're aiming at modern-day realism, but more of them are fine for futuristic fantasy. Pretty much everything here does have kind of a made-up feel to it.

Either way the assonance between Kai/Koi, Esmond/Osmond, and Oystein/Oyvind will probably be confusing to readers. Secel Sedon is also very same-y.

Land, Village, and Capital aren't usually used in place names. I'm not sure what a past-way is either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TERFs are just transphobic feminists. If normal transphobes aren't alt-right, which they aren't because that's a whole ideology which includes transphobia but also many other and I'd say more characteristic stances, then TERFs aren't either.

This is not a defense of TERFs, but I don't believe mischaracterizing them does anyone any good. If a person is trans-exclusionary and a feminist, they're a TERF, and the rest of their positions can vary person from person. I have seen a good number of TERF blogs and they run the full gamut from sincerely thinking they're leftist to in fact being trads/Nazis/alt-right/whatever, never mind how both those combinations require a massive amount of cognitive dissonance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been in some of the most ardently feminist circles on the internet for about a decade and I don't believe I've ever seen anyone make the argument that single-gender organizations are harmful, aside from maybe fraternities, but that's due to the culture surrounding them rather than the fact that they're for men. Actually, I'd say that women's organizations are usually to some extent or another feminist.

This is my personal view but I think it's very mainstream among modern intersectional feminists: although in an ideal world, everyone would be completely equal and most single-gender organizations would be unnecessarily exclusionary, we do not live in that world and it makes sense for women to work together for their professional/political/social advancement. Besides, it makes sense to have separate organizations for things like choirs and sports, although extra care needs to be taken not to be transphobic in those cases. (No discourse on that last point PLEASE) I guess I'm just wondering where the research question here is coming from. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, that's what I was thinking of, thanks! If you don't mind could you do one for LGBT identities too? Don't worry about it if it's too much of a bother, I'm just curious.

Ok, I just tried looking it up to get more clarification and saw someone saying that it was essentially a probability which didn't seem to track with the -5 to 5 score.

I mean like, the average man will have a negative score for diagnosticity and the average woman will have a positive one, so for example looking at gender role fit vs. diagnosticity the correlation is positive for women and negative for men, but it essentially means the same thing for both, which took me a couple of seconds. Like I said I don't know if there's really a better way to do it though.

Thanks for your time! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for sharing! It's always great to see results. For the last section (on critical-ness of gender) would you be willing to share the raw results and/or a breakdown by demographics?

Also, I'm not quite sure I get the diagnosticity score - I get that it's a measure of how well your responses predict your gender, but does the number itself mean anything? I think it's a little confusing that the signs are different for I guess you would call it a masculine or feminine diagnosticity score when looking at the later measures, I don't know what a better method would be because the original 0-1 rating is even worse imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'd guess it's because there's no consensus on what the term 'toxic femininity' means exactly, but I'd argue that what I understand it to be (essentially the ideal that women should conform to feminine standards of behavior and presentation, and punish one another if they do not, essentially the opposite of toxic masculinity) is a CLASSIC feminist subject and was thoroughly discussed far before toxic masculinity. Like, the image many people have of feminists is women who don't wear makeup, bras, or uncomfortable clothes, which could be considered a pushback against toxic femininity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel like it's the exact same thing as dude. "Guys" "my guy" "dude!" "hey man" I wouldn't blink at saying to a woman, but like, I wouldn't say "So I just met this guy" or "dude was nuts" about a woman. Weirdly, I would call myself a guy in certain contexts ("I'm not the right kinda guy for this"), but I think it definitely is interpreted as masculine in that context. </TEXT>

you’re probably not living on campus next year, the old cards won’t work since they’re replacing all the dorm swipe access points with RFID ones. which is ridiculous in the first place because anyone can still get into the dorms by just following the person in front of them in, sure it cost them a fat wad of cash that could have been spent on a hundred more important things too </TEXT>

I kept saying "damn I could make a better design in 10 minutes in MS Paint" so decided to test it out. TBF this took more like 20 minutes, but still.

Featuring:

* The actual Rutgers red instead of the literal default MS Paint red
* Putting the seal back in so it's not just all white. So. Ugly.
* Why the hell did they put the picture in the lower right corner? No one does that!!!
* Added back school + campus pride
* Extreme pixelation because after all, paint is a garbage program

I'm still so mad that they made us get rid of the old ones. They're just going to chuck them, right? And they have to print the new ones anyway, so why not just give them to us for free? What do they think I'm gonna do, commit identity fraud with *my own identity*? Christ. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i can't believe this is even controversial. i can see i'm not going to change your mind but i do ask that if you use slurs that don't apply to you to please consider that many people in your life will not take it as a joke at all, even if they don't tell you so to your face. or if you only have people who don't flinch at blase usage of slurs in your life, that you probably know more actual racists than you think.

will also say that in pewdiepie's case, he didn't tell a joke in the slightest, just yelled the word as far as i'm aware. also, how exactly does one parse the difference between saying a slur ironically or seriously? if someone can throw around extremely racist language without becoming an "actual racist," what would they have to say to become one in your eyes? is ["death to all Jews"](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/youtubes-biggest-star-pewdiepie-causes-controversy-death-all-jews-video-1600569) bad enough? literally where is the humor in either of these things? ironic racism is usually just racism. like, show me one person who truly respects poc and still calls them horrible things, or says they should all die, even if they put "lol JK" at the end. you cannot find this person because these things are mutually exclusive, because the bare minimum of respecting people is like. not insulting their whole race. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just wanted to clarify my answer to "Do you believe Jewish people have more economic or political power than other ethnic, racial, or religious groups?"

I said maybe, I completely do not believe Jewish people, like. Control the government or whatever other canards people with their brains rotted out from 4chan are claiming these days. But I'd also hedge that they're not *the* poorest or most disenfranchised group in the US, so technically yes? Although the political climate is, uh, not very encouraging on this front.

I'd also say the question about is antisemitism increasing is a bit ambiguous because you could say no and either mean it's not a problem or that it's always been a huge problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT> See, that second part would have been fine if he had showed back up on the platform :/

As for the first, I could have sworn they showed a photo of the husband in CATWS but I tried looking it up and I guess not! That could very well be the intent, but it still doesn't make sense. Everyone's just so adamant that changing the past cannot have an effect on the future, which to me indicates that there isn't a way to create a closed time loop with this method of time travel, otherwise Cap *could have* changed things in the past of the current timeline even if he chose not to. God sorry, what a horrible sentence. Mmmaybe the idea is if you're very careful not to change anything you'll end up at the same future??? That's just not how they said it works, though, they should have put in a quick line if that was the case.

Also, if true it means he kissed his niece, ghhghhghrh. And Sharon somehow didn't know her uncle even though she knew Peggy? Like there's just a lot of problems here.

TBF Marvel movies often don't make a ton of sense, in the end the main point is they're action movies with big fucking budgets. But like this is on the tier of Tony inventing a new element that looked like a weird sphere in Iron Man 2, which me and my high-school level chemistry education are still mad about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're completely right. Maybe I missed it, but in order for this to not be a massive plothole there needed to be something about being able to specify which timeline you travel to. I haven't seen Dr. Strange but to me his lines in IW about there being millions (!!) of timelines is... even worse lol.

I also really cannot understand how old Cap ends up in the original timeline because it was stated VERY CLEARLY that changing the past doesn't affect the future. Which would seem to mean that travelling back always creates a new timeline, separate from the present you came from - so Peggy in our main TL should have still ended up married to Daniel, and Steve *really* should have been in an alternate TL!!! There's legit no explanation aside from Marvel going "and why would it need to make sense? we know you're still giving us your money idiots ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯" and you know what, I did, so, </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’d say it depends on his tone. As other commenters have pointed out a good number of LGBT people like to point out when something gives off gay vibes, is there any possibility he’s bi and doing it like, “hey, cool! gay!”? If he’s straight this is definitely obnoxious at best.

At any rate I’ve unfortunately never had any success with getting people close to me to stop making offensive jokes, so I’ll just say that if he ever makes an off-color comment around your sister you need to make it clear that you don’t agree. IDC how many lgbt+ people are in this thread saying it’s fine, as a lesbian and also just a person with an actually good sense of humor, it annoys me and I actively avoid people who do it. She’d be well within her rights to not want to deal with him - and possibly you by association.

In general, please always feel free to take offense to stuff like this. It’s never a bad thing to ask others to reconsider how their words and actions come off, and to try to be kinder - and it can definitely be a bad thing to stand by when someone is being cruel or inconsiderate. </TEXT>

You know what really helped me with my sad times? 😞 DoTerra oils❤️

>**Blue**: You're seriously trying to sell me your shitty fucking oils?

**Grey**: Oh wow! 😯 sorry you feel that way sweetie, your grandma and I are good friends and she buys my oils all the time! I just thought I'd be nice and reach out for you and try to sell you some calming oils... Guess I was wrong 🤔 Maybe listing some that can help with suicide will interest you?

>**Blue**: No. What helps when I'm suicidal is coping skills that I learned from my therapist. Not essential fucking oils. Thanks anyway.

**Grey**: Hmmmmm... Okay then. No need to swear at me, sweetheart. Guess you shouldn't have held on with the attitude you got! ☺️ Goodnight, [name censored]

<TEXT> LTL/FTP, etc. (Actually my first post on Reddit! Hi!) Apologies for the length, I have a habit of stewing in my thoughts for ages until I need a text wall to get everything out.

It just confuses me to no end why people seem to lose their absolute minds at the barest insinuation that not everyone on Earth wants kids. I'm talking totally neutral stuff, like 'not everybody has kids' or 'it's possible that [person] might decide not to have kids' are guaranteed to draw rebuttals like they aren't literally facts. Like, please take this energy to real problems.

Another recent post mentioned how especially weird and sad it is that even people who were once CF sometimes turn into the people who bingo you at every opportunity. It reminded me of a conversation I had at Thanksgiving with my cousin and our aunt. My cousin is a senior in high school and I'm a few years older, aka both way too young to reasonably have children. At some point, the aunt said something to the cousin involving, "one day when you're married and have kids of your own," blah blah blah.

Cousin basically mm-hmm'ed in response, and I asked her if she wanted to get married and/or have kids, because I was genuinely curious and wasn't sure if the aunt was assuming or if they had had a conversation about it at some point or what. Cousin doesn't get to respond because aunt decides to rehash a lecture I swear she's given me verbatim on several occasions despite the fact that I see her like a few times a year:

Aunt: So do YOU want kids?

Me: No.

Her: *scoff, smirk* I thought that when I was your age, too. :) And you wanna know a secret?

Me: ...um...

Her: Your mother never wanted kids either, but eventually you get to a point in your life and you just decide, hey, I wanna have children.

Me: ...We'll see!

Side note, it's true my mom didn't want kids when she was younger (this is not in any way a secret because everyone in this family loves to use it as a gotcha); luckily, she herself is pretty supportive, and it's so annoying how people use her as this rhetorical tool when she's said I should do what makes me happy. My dad, for example, has this whole shtick that he still thinks is clever after only, I don't know, the twentieth time, where I mention I'm not having kids and he goes, "You know I once knew a beautiful, talented, amazing, independent young woman who said the same thing, very adamantly, for many years, and if it wasn't for her changing her mind, you wouldn't be here :)" Retch.

Also I don't understand how the fact that other people changed their minds is in any way relevant to whether **I** will. At this point every time I get this spiel I zone out to a happier plane of existence where nobody is an idiot and I say, "Isn't it nice how we all know that anecdotes can't be used to prove a trend, and that even proven trends don't guarantee individual outcomes?" and everyone nods and politely doesn't continue to tell me about how I may not know it yet but someday I'm gonna have babiessssssssss.

TL;DR the whole "as a parent I am extremely wise and you are a poor naive bastard for imagining you're not gonna have kids" bit is so very old and I wish it would stop, and I especially wish people would stop doing it when I didn't even SAY anything about not wanting kids </TEXT>

**Black**

I've been so sad lately. My anxiety has been so bad and I've fallen into kind of a deep hole. I just go through the motions of the day with crippling anxiety. I even had to quit my job from all of the panic attacks. I finally got the courage to call my doctor, get my meds adjusted, and ask for a referral for a therapist.

I was so excited when someone I went to college with asked me to go out to dinner. When she asked me, I scanned her profile for signs of her shilling MLM. There were none so I agreed to dinner. I was SO over the moon someone wanted to be my friend!!

I put on nice clothes, did my make up and hair, and went to dinner. The first 15 minutes were great! We laughed about the old days, and I was really happy. Something I haven't felt for a while.

She asked me about my cheek highlighter. I saved up and bought myself an Anastasia Beverly Hills pallet. I told her I loved it and it was a nice treat to myself.

Boom. There was her in. She sells Mary Kay. She wanted to 'borrow my face' and 'pamper' me to build my self esteem. Because, it'd help with my horrible anxiety if I put on her 'high quality' makeup every morning. Karen quote: 'if you look good you feel good.'

I told her that I wasn't interested and I'd like to not talk about MK and just keep the conversation light hearted. She went to the bathroom to 'fix her lipstick' about 10 minutes after that. She never came back. I cried in the Applebee's bathroom.

<TEXT> It seems like no one in my family actually wanted kids. Every time I say I don't I get hit with the "I thought that way when I was your age too :) ;) :) ;) :)" bullshit. Even if I do someday change my mind, it's not helpful to hear right now (and honestly it makes me even more determined to stay CF in the name of spite. Like can you fucking imagine, I'd never hear the end of it). It makes me vaguely sad that they would pass on the disrespect they surely got when they were younger. Like OP says, they should know exactly how bad it feels to be told everyone else knows better about your own life plans. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally, I'm finding college harder than high school not necessarily because of the work but because I first of all did practically no extracurriculars in high school and now am juggling a few plus work, and also I'm responsible for all the chores unlike at home where my parents did some of the laundry/cleaning.

I also have trouble with keeping a normal sleep schedule, always have, and now there's no one to drag my ass out of bed if I'm going to miss class. I know it's sad that I'm still having issues as a sophomore... I haven't been doing poorly in my classes to the extent you describe, but I'm probably not retaining as much from my classes as I should be, and my health does not love the sleep deprivation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would pronounce both Aybria and Abria as ay-bree-uh, with accent on the first syllable. Putting the y in makes it a bit clearer.

As for initial thoughts, it's unusual and I don't think there's a single most-intuitive spelling, which might cause some logistical issues, but it's not completely off-the-wall. It sounds very similar to a lot of other more common girls' names, too. I won't lie, I don't absolutely love it, but it's not terrible either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> >Giving an example of an online petition is not the same thing.

? I'm referring to the movement for a $15 minimum wage, especially in the fast-food industry. They have organized a lot of huge walk-outs, strikes, and picket lines over the last few years. They're the reason why Seattle raised their minimum wage.

I didn't say that everyone can afford the risk. In your original comment, you said, "this doesn't do anything except potentially get you fired." I'm saying it's not a guarantee you'd be fired - and if you were, you'd have a solid legal case on your hands, although I'm sure most people don't want to deal with all that - and it's possible that wages would increase. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think that's true!! The Fight for $15 says on their website that they've won raises for over 22 million workers. Not exactly the same, but they're an example of a modern mass protest in the service industry having some level of success. Of course there's a lot of risk involved in any direct action, but it's not accurate to say there's no possible positive outcome.

Also, not that it doesn't happen, but it's not technically legal in the US to be fired for striking/protesting the employer in most industries under the NLRA. </TEXT>

Mast cells ARE blood cells... and even if they weren't, the extracellular matrix in between other cell types is mostly water too. I mean, like I said, there are people who get urticaria from contact with water, and you could write about that 100% realistically, because it's real. You could also write someone with debilitating aquaphobia who behaves in the way your character does, who doesn't realize that her drinks and body fluids are water-based. But someone who's allergic to water, there is NOTHING they could drink, and it sounds like she can't take IV fluids either, which is a pretty insurmountable challenge to survival. Not to mention she'd be constantly in anaphylaxis reacting to if not her own blood, her saliva, sweat, tears, and mucous. You just couldn't possibly live without water. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It sounds like you could make it interesting, but the premise is totally impossible, like 0/10 realistic imo. Your blood (as well as milk and orange juice) are suspensions composed mostly of water. There are some people who have a skin reaction to contact with water, so something like that would be realistic, but you just have to be able to consume or otherwise intake liquids or you'd die, and everything we drink is either water-based or dehydrating. The other thing is I guess you could write about a nonhuman. </TEXT>

Mongoloid is especially jarring to see because it's been used as an insult against people with Down syndrome.

<TEXT> I think the context definitely matters a lot. You can call a friend a motherfucker playfully but it can definitely also be used offensively, similarly to how racial insults become a LOT less offensive if used by someone of the impacted race, especially if not used in an insulting manner. It helps to have the quotes in context like this but for a couple of the terms I feel like there's a wide range of offensiveness they take on. Bitch for example changes depending on the gender of both the speaker and the person referred to as well as other cultural context. It can be used super casually and in most contexts barely registers as offensive to me but still carries some serious weight if used by a man against a woman as an insult. Cool survey, please post results when you have them! </TEXT>

How close are they? It's not always clear, for instance the one where the woman is talking to you about her crashed car, whether or not I would care to listen depends on if she's a stranger. I also agree that by making one choice feel morally superior it may skew the results. Also I got the "distracted by noise" result, there's a typo ("nois").

[*blurred*] recently named the fastest growing [*blurred*] in the world, is looking for a very special person, with very specific skills. A great deal of what [*blurred*] does is create fundraising events of all kinds but the Director of Galas, as the name suggests will be creating very upscale events almost exclusively. For that reason, [*here to the end of the sentence is highlighted*] only people who travel in those circles should apply for this position. In fact, although the [*another highlighted section begins*] compensation for this position could easily top $350,000 [*highlight ends*] annually, this could actually be a perfect position for an [*highlight begins*] independently wealthy individual [*highlight ends*] and/or a person who is very philanthropically minded.

I've never heard of Anheli, it looks nice but will get misspelled very frequently, and the connection to the flower is not clear - it looks like an alternate spelling of Annalee. </TEXT>

**Black**

I am looking for an MLM, network/digital marketing opportunity that will allow me to bring in enough income to be able to be a working stay at home mother to my 6 month old daughter. I've learned a great deal about one opportunity, but am still a little skeptical because of the substantial amount of money wanted to really get started. Ladies I need help finding something legit. I'm willing to work hard and put in whatever time and dedication is required!

**lt is going to take me awhile to sift through the comments and see what I may be interested in so it may take me a little while to get back to some of you. I appreciate all the comments though, I had no idea there were this many opportunities out there!

<TEXT> - Jack: Perfectly acceptable! John / Jonathan / Jacob are possible long forms, as well as Jackson although personally I am not a fan of that one. Has a similar feel to James / Jamie, somewhat jaunty but works for any age.

- Wells: Don't recommend this as a first name, although I find it charming as a last name. Guessing it's short for Wellington, which doesn't really strike me as a people name due to the dish and the city. Also, it would grab his attention any time someone started a sentence "Well, ..." Maxwell, Nelson, Ellis, and Elliot all have a similar feel.

- Harrison: Alright! Brings to mind Harrison Ford. Personally, I prefer Harris or just Harry.

- Lawson: Eh, I could take it or leave it. Both Laurence / Lawrence and Dawson look and sound nicer to me. Also reminiscient of Larson.

- Rhys: Well, it looks and sounds cool, but I literally thought it was pronounced "rise" for over a decade after I first saw it in the Two Princesses of Bamarre, so just expect mispronunciation and spelling. Very similar to Reed, kind of reminds me of Pierce. Probably the most viable name with that kickass of a spelling, though. Schuyler I also think looks really cool, but again, both pronunciation and spelling issues...

- Vaughn: haven't heard this one in a hot second. It's cool though. If you don't live in Germany it might not be a problem. Reminds me of Vincent, Vance, Shaun, John / Jean.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think anything that ends in a consonant sound would work fine! Do you have any other input, like do you have a style you like, any names you like but don't match the middle name? It might help us tailor the suggestions a little more. These are more or less random non -a names with 1 or 3 syllables - since both the middle and last have 2 it might be good to have a different length first.

<TEXT> Yeah, I could really write a full-length response to most of those to clarify what I mean! For instance, on the shaving question, most feminists support a woman's choice to groom as she wishes but oppose the cultural notion that expects women but not men to remove body hair, and I'd guess are a bit less likely to shave than the average woman, though most still do. Is that agreement or disagreement with "Feminists don’t shave and are against the act"? Overall this was lots of fun though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This has been done a few times, so if you need/would like instant results you can just search "pick a number" in this sub. Also, you'll most likely get more results if you throw this in a Google form, plus that avoids the possibility that seeing others' answers will affect results (I'm guessing people are less likely to pick a number if they see others already have. If this is the purpose of the study, I still suggest using some other response form - you can't really tell who actually looked at the other responses first, and if so which ones they saw.)

<TEXT> 1. Well, unless my own given name comes out of the top spot I guess I'm forced to go with an invented name... I think I could come up with something usable, probably a slight variant like Charlina.

2. End!!! Matching first letters is a little tacky. If I was going to have kids, I wouldn't want them to feel "matched," each is their own person.

3. ...virtue names are kind of a guilty favorite so those haha. I really like Clemency and Verity.

4. 3 letters for sure, especially for girls there are a lot of great options - Eve, Ada, Ivy, Zoe. Boys are harder, but Ash and Jay are both fine, I think. I literally can't think of any names that are 11 letters long.

5. Mom names TBH

6. Honestly I don't care about matching sibsets, but hate ones that are basically the same, so too different

7. No middle names, two middle names is a little excessive for my tastes. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lilia - Nice enough, but as others have said I prefer Lily

Allura - Sounds nice, but... Voltron, man.

Tess - I've always thought this was cool, but it sounds like a nickname - I would strongly suggest giving the full name Theresa, Therese, or Tessa.

Kepler - odd as a first name. Cool for a character (Kep is hip), a bit heavy for a real person to wear.

Newt - ehhh. Objectively, not the worst, especially as a nickname for Newton, but Newt Gingrich... also too short (and weird, honestly) as a full name.

Elio - uncommon, not bad but definitely comes off Italian.

That being said, I think the subtle theming you've got is kind of cool and understated enough not to be tacky :] Are the girls' names themed as well? I was thinking tess(eract) but can't for the life of me tell how Lilia or Allura are related. If you're taking suggestions, maybe Katherine after Johnson, Ada after Lovelace, or Valentina after Tereshkova. Isaac and Johan(nes) are also totally viable options. </TEXT>

So today is lesbian day of visibility and as both a trans and bi woman going on twitter has been literally hellish, apparently i am a confused straight male who wears dresses to exert my straight white male privlage, apparently blatant transphobia is just being a reasonable lesbian, and that the state in which I was born in is innate and indicitive of how I will remain for the rest of my life.

This kind of bullshit is even worse than what I faced for being bi as a kid, where people would openly through around F!g in reference to me.

But now, homophobia isn't as public a thing anymore, though I know first hand that it still exists in large capacity, and these people who only 10 years ago were rallying in the streets to destigmatise who they were are now activly attacking people who are trying to do the same.

I just wanted to vent sorry if this isn't as funny as the typical content posted here, I don't really have any other places to vent about this terf stuff.

Yall are valid as shit and I care about you <3

McCleary - very Irish, not bad, don't particularly like the two c's next to each other like that. MacLeary looks a little nicer IMO.

Banks - seems a bit snobbish, perhaps because of the banking association even though I'm sure that's not where it actually comes from. Reminds me a bit of the Mary Poppins books. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are only two sexes but gender is the social understanding of roles for men and women. Gender is more nebulous and is used to discuss a few different concepts. First, as a class: essentially, the sum of cultural ideas surrounding what is appropriate for a person, assigned to them based on their sex at birth, and later perhaps by their presentation. For instance, 'men shouldn't wear dresses' and 'women are better elementary school teachers' are ideas related to gender; both are purely cultural concepts which have nothing to do with sex.

In Western society there are traditionally only two genders. But in many other cultures there have been distinctive genders which are neither male nor female, a 'third gender' which varies by culture.

When Western trans people talk about there being more than two genders, they are referring to gender *identity* - how you see yourself with respect to gender roles. If you don't understand yourself as fitting into the idea of 'female' or 'male' as it exists in our culture, to the extent where you feel dysphoria when perceived as either, this is where you get concepts such as agender, genderfluid, etc. While nonbinary as a *class* does not really exist in the West, it exists as an *identity,* and if enough people come to accept this, over time it will become a class with its own set of assumptions that come with it.

Essentially, when people say this, they are indicating that they want to work to make people outside our current gender schemas become more accepted into society. To me, it's a sign that their heart is in the right place and that they're LGBT-friendly. </TEXT>

[*A closeup of a smiling, blonde, Caucasian woman. Two pictures have been edited together so the halves of her face are from separate images.

On the right, her complexion looks much paler, freckles can be seen, her hair is down, and it seems like she is only wearing blush in terms of makeup. Along the left side of the left half of the image, some partially cut-off teal text, seemingly a product list, reads:*

> If capitalism was just everyone having a private means of production and inequality was limited to how hard and how well individuals worked then it probably wouldn't be so horrendous and antithetical to anarchism (in fact, that's basically what mutualists advocate, and they generally call themselves anarchists). The problem is that's not how capitalism has worked in the real world, nor is there a reset button for us to press. Even if we could start over, the market system produces inequality to a way that generates more and more inequality. The goal of anarchism is a society without rulers. I'm sorry, but the only way to accomplish that is to prevent individuals from having authority over others. That means equality. Capitalism relies on relationships of dominance and submission. Anarchists are opposed to those relationships. They don't have a reputation for disobedience for nothing!

>> **\/u/End-Da-Fed**, poeng gjemt

>>> Capitalism relies on relationships of dominance and submission.

>> Capitalism relies on two consenting parties engaging in a consensual, win-win transaction only. Statism is unique in relying on relationships of dominance and submission between State actors and Non-State actors.

>> Statism is present in Capitalism. I oppose that.

>> Statism is very pronounced in Socialism/Communism/Fascism. I also oppose that.

>> That's why I'm AnCap.

<TEXT> Eleanor Francis sounds great! Would you consider spelling it Frances? Pronounced the same, a little more conventional for a girl. Both Eleanor and Emilia / Amelia / Emily / Emma are pretty trendy right now, if that matters to you, all perfectly wearable IMO. Effy really doesn't sound professional, in my opinion.

Some more E name suggestions: Eden, Elle / Ella, Elise, Eloise, and the always-classic Elizabeth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ?????

- How is what I said anything like that? There's no evidence to support bias against people with red shirts. The evidence is abundant and easy to find which supports bias against POC. [Here](http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/Whitening%20MS%20R2%20Accepted.pdf) is a recent version of the resume study. [Here](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/Publications/pdf/HUD-514_HDS2012_execsumm.pdf) is a study about how minority individuals seeking housing are impacted by implicit bias.

- Internalized racism is a thing and a problem that people do in fact have the right to complain about... just because racial bias is so ingrained in society that everyone's views, including minorities, are impacted by it, doesn't make it right.

- I still haven't seen a source on how implicit bias isn't real. I'm ending this conversation if you don't either have any concrete evidence for this or engage with my actual points. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not responding to any of my arguments. Neither of us brought up IQ. I looked into it a bit more and the IAT measure doesn't seem to be useful on an individual level (which wasn't really what I said), but I still think that the average score is significant, and even if it's completely thrown out that doesn't disprove the evidence of implicit bias at work in all other settings, such as hiring, as I mentioned. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Proven? I mean, it's depending on reaction times of fractions of a second, so of course it's going to change between tests. But if you go through one of the Harvard IATs it shows you the average of everyone's results. If there was no such thing as implicit bias, shouldn't the average of hundreds of thousands of test-takers be perfectly neutral? But instead, you see a skew towards more positive feelings for the majority group, indicating that there is subconscious bias. I can't see anything wrong with their methodology and can't think of another convincing explanation for those results.

Again, I cannot find sources to back up your argument and would genuinely like to see them. I've just seen so many studies supporting the existence and impact of implicit bias that I find it hard to be convinced without evidence. Please feel free to DM if you'd like. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, what's due to group aggression? The differentiated arrest rates or whites getting more prison for meth? I'm having trouble finding sources for drug rates differentiated by both race and drug type, I'd be interested in that source, I didn't know that.

Who's disproved implicit bias??? It's still an accepted concept across the board in research everywhere I know of, and I think it comes across pretty clearly when you look at job advancement data and such forth. I honestly can't think of another explanation for the results of that study showing that employers view the same resume less favorably when it has a more African-American sounding name, for instance. If it really has been disproved so conclusively I'd be intrigued to see the evidence against it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup. I mean, if you just look at the Wikipedia page for institutional racism you've got a staggering amount of evidence, I think the most damning and commonly cited stat is that black and white people use and sell drugs at nearly the same rates but [black people are 2.7x more likely to get arrested for it.](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/rates_of_drug_use_and_sales_by_race_rates_of_drug_related_criminal_justice)

There are endless examples one could point to, but purely logically speaking, nearly everyone has some level of unconscious bias, white people don't experience racism and are therefore less likely than minorities to spend the time needed to fully understand and try to avoid acting on that bias in every way it manifests, and white people are still disproportionately represented at the highest echelons of society, ergo institutional racism should pretty much be expected.

I honestly don't think there's a real, good-faith argument that it doesn't exist at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey OP! I hope you'll forgive me for this big ass novel, I feel really strongly about this topic. I just changed what I introduce myself as this year (still have the old name legally, it's a hassle to change), I'm 18 and it was convenient to do it as I entered college. I wholeheartedly agree that people should change their name for any reason they like; your statement that everyone should love the name they live with is spot-on. I spent a long time agonizing as there are a lot of nay-sayers, but I think if you genuinely dislike your name and have no emotional connection you probably won't regret it. Give it a test run on the Internet and with your SO for a few weeks, see how it feels.

I'd wanted to do it for years and have no regrets, although maybe it's a little too soon to tell. My parents surprisingly said literally nothing negative to me, and I have kept it rather on the down-low so no one except my close friends have really had a chance to react at all - I figure I'm going to see most people from high school again only a few times in my life, not worth explaining. I was so close to chickening out because the thought of telling my parents scared the shit out of me, but then one night I just realized that the idea of having a name I hated on everything I ever achieved freaked me out more.

Cons:

* Awkward situations are bound to come up if you are still using both in any contexts, legal or like I'm doing, if you let old acquaintances use the old one. Might also not go over great in conservative families and workplaces. Just based on the Internet, seems like certain people really get into a tizzy about how you're disrespecting your parents or whatever, and you may have one or more of these people in your life. Probably the most serious thing to consider - is it safe, physically and financially, for you to do this right now?

* The kind of jolt you typically get hearing your name has not fully switched over yet at seven months in, which can be a bit inconvenient.

* I kind of feel guilty for having done this around closeted trans people I know... awkward as fuck to explain the change when they haven't gotten to a place where it's safe to change their own names for much more substantial reasons.

Pros:

* Don't have to hear the old name anymore! It really grated on my ears and has been in the top 10 consistently since the year I was born. I felt it was boring, starts with a sound I don't like, is too feminine, and lends itself to dumb af nicknames. (Objectively it's not bad, it's popular for a reason, but I just cringed every time people said it.) And you get to force people to say a name you think sounds cool whenever they want your attention!!!

* You can do whatever the hell you want! You couldn't ethically name a kid anything like Seven Evergreen Wilson, but you can do that to yourself, theoretically. I'm considering doing something really fun for my middle when I change it legally. You can pick something with a lot of meaning, or something you just think sounds kickass or beautiful or anything else you want to prioritize.

* All of a sudden it kind of feels like a superpower to introduce yourself as something and then that's what people call you. Weird. Cause and effect. It seriously feels like you've been given a lot more agency in life.

If you decide to go for it, let us know what you pick!!! </TEXT>

So, it's time for me to come clean....

Literally💩! Y'all, recently I have been bloated and feeling sluggish. I'm also NOT going to the 💩
bathroom 2-3 times a day. So, BioCleanse to the rescue!

🍑 BioCleanse oxygenates and energizes the body.

🍑 BioCleanse neutralizes the acidic conditions that may promote pathogens.

🍑 BioCleanse helps detox and cleanse the body; not only GI but also arteries.

🍑 BioCleanse oxygenates the blood.

PLUS, Plexus BioCleanse is rich in magnesium and has the added benefit of a slight amount of sodium. The magnesium and sodium together create a chemical reaction that flood tissues with oxygen creating an alkaline environment in the bowel!

What's cool about that? Certain disease causing cells cannot survive in an alkaline and oxygenated body! Who doesn't love that?

<TEXT> I have legit no idea what you're talking about. The first Nora I think of is Nora Rowley from minor YA book "The Report Card." I think Nora is coming back into style (top 50 last year) just because old-fashioned names in general are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, Thiago is... really cool, actually, and doesn't sound made-up. It's like Iago but without the negative association. I've never heard it ever, but nameberry says it was #267 last year. Siena's also great. Kallen really makes me think the parents are Code Geass fans...

Thanks for sharing! I always wonder a bit if anyone's ever recognized that it's a list of their classmates, there's always a few standouts that make them a distinctive cohort. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm, well I approached it the same way as getting a username on a website, I want something as short as possible with no numbers and which is or sounds like a real name or word, which I usually do by scouring through wiktionary, but everyone has different priorities. What style are you aiming for?

Maybe too obvious, but is baileybluetoo (or other users you use on other sites) taken? I think that's cute and probably uncommon enough to be available. It's also easy to riff off if taken (baileyblue / baileyblues / bluebailey / bluebaileytoo for starters) </TEXT>

Fact: Women are more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's in their lifetime than breast cancer.

Fact: 65% of Alzheimer's patients are women.

Fact: Alzheimer's Is Now Being Called Type 3 Diabetes.

I don't want "normal" glucose levels. I'm aiming for optimal!

I'm so thankful for all the tools in my toolbelt to help keep me healthy and set me up for a healthy future as I age. One of my favorite things is my amazing blood sugar balancing pink drink! If I live to be 100 you'll still see me drinking this! 😀

<TEXT> Hey, OP! I was practically the exact same situation last year. It'll get better when you move out - honestly, radically differing political opinions put a HUGE pressure on any relationship and things will become less tense when you don't see him in person very often, on your visits home (if you visit) hopefully he will want to spend some time catching up and you'll have a lot more power to end conversations.

For now, don't engage. Try your damndest to change the topic or shut down the conversation; what I did was carry around some schoolwork wherever I went and you can typically end the discussion with, "Dad not now, I gotta work on this. Please let me focus." (If you're done everything just grab a book or write whatever you'd like in a notebook.) Don't open his emails, ignore what you can. If you can avoid dinner by going out with friends or otherwise being out of the house when the family eats, that will help. There's very little point in trying to change his mind when he refuses to argue in good faith. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I kind of like The Uppercut! It seems like it's been used before; I don't think I personally have seen a salon called that, but if that's what you go with you may want to add your name or the town for maximum google-ability. I agree that anything even remotely crass (ahh snip, love of hair, and damn salon) will probably lose more potential customers than draw them in. A lot of people have delicate sensibilities...

<TEXT> So, modernized classic, or cheeky and a reference to a good role model? Hmm, that's seriously tough. Do you have anyone else in particular you would like to honor? The first thing that comes to mind and which has a similar feel - maybe too much? is Wolf after Virginia Woolf. Or maybe Dante?

From various monarchs whom I know nothing about, hopefully not notoriously bad: Edmond?; William -> Wil, Wilson, Liam, Willem; Rudolph -> Rudy; Alexander is always cool; Valentinian -> Valentin(e), Valery; Leo is still in style.

I found the name Cassander while googling monarchs which is enormously cool but pretty much unusable, like Constantin and Tiberius. :(

Wiktionary says 'kanagutsuwa' (金轡) is Japanese for both a bit for a horse and has the kanji for gold in it for something a bit weeby although not a real name, and I think Gin is used as a name (which can be spelled as silver). Aurelius is not a bad option either. Some minerals with gold:

Calaverite nn Cal or Calla: AuTe₂

Sylvanite nn Sylvie or Sylv: (Ag,Au)Te₂

<TEXT> Orville = gold town

Electrum? = alloy of gold and silver

Rhodite = alloy of gold and rhodium

I mean, horses have really freaking weird names sometimes, I think the phrase 'native silver' is pretty cool, if you've ever watched a horse race I'm sure you know some of the owners must have named them while on crack. It depends a lot on the setting, though, could you tell us a bit more about it? Does it take place in the past, in the present, in the future, in a real country or place based on a real country? Is the person who named him in the story, and if so, where are they from and what are they like? A lot of fantasy takes place in fictionalized Medieval-ish times, which really puts the kibosh on your range of options - a lot less international travel and communication, so people (and their pets!) will almost certainly have names originating from their culture.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it's unusual to pick out glamorous names to stand out more and if that's what OP wants to do I don't see why not. The rest is great advice! The British equivalent of SAG is Equity. SAG's website says you should have three alternate names in mind when signing up, so try not to get super attached to anything.

Maybe try Quint or Quentin if Quinn is taken, do check if anyone else famous has anything too similar to the names you decide on first. I don't like Diana Quinn, the sound and spelling together is a little reminiscient of 'mannequin' or something. I think Cleo really doesn't sound like a last name, maybe Cleto? </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have this in NJ. It was an absolute joke class, honestly, and requiring anything reduces the number of electives you can take, so I was a little annoyed. You'd have to make sure the curriculum standards were well-designed and provide a budget to hire actual econ teachers if the school doesn't have them - my class was taught by, like, the geometry teacher, who barely knew more than us. I kind of wish they had split it up into A and honors levels, I'm sure some people literally do not know how credit works and it helped them a great deal but I feel like it just wasted my time.

It's kind of like health class - it's an amazing idea in theory, but I can name like 2 things I learned in 4 years because it's mostly common knowledge, and meanwhile my guy friends still don't seem to know what the hell ovulation is because half the class is asleep all the time. Maybe they should just let you test out of these things; I really wanted to take an art class or something in high school. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Man, this is difficult. Would your husband be ok with just using your last name? Or maybe you could find some way to combine them, I have a friend whose parents did this and their names just so happened to be ones that made it sound really good, and I never found it odd that they didn't all share a name as it was still obviously a combination. I guess otherwise I'd go with 3. I think having a double-barrel is unusual for a child and then they're kind of in a bind if they ever get married (triple barrel time?) and it's important for you to pass down this name so I don't think you should do 2.

I think 3 may come off a bit odd to anyone who knows the full names, although it's definitely better to have it as a second rather than only mn. Most people probably won't know the middle name - but that may also kind of mitigate the purpose of giving them your ln in the first place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm, is it named by the native inhabitants, by humans, or by alien colonists? If it's named by the original inhabitants, you could just basically combine any characters you want, I think, it's not constrained by the sounds that are in English or anything, go wild with diacritics. In many languages, the name for our earth comes from the name of the goddess representing the world. In East Asian languages, it's pretty much "dirt sphere." If it's alien colonists, in our example we named the other nearby planets based on other gods. If you're into conlangs or you're planning on coming up with some major religions you could take all of that into account. It might help if you gave some more guidance on the climate and culture, if there is one.

If it's named by humans, we currently use the IAU convention, which if the story takes place in the near-ish future and the planet isn't inhabited by sentient beings we might just keep using the IAU name, or else pick something more distinctive from mythology. The spelling will also depend on if there's a dominant country in space travel. If it is inhabited probably we would try to romanize the alien name, or if it's totally unpronounceable maybe give it some kind of name from Greek or Roman mythology, I would guess.

I'm guessing you're asking about the "named by aliens" case, I really think you can just keysmash a little bit. Put some click or trill markers in there for added fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT> What criteria did you use picking names to represent both cultures? Looking at just the nameberry pages, it seems like only Leah is either Hebrew or Japanese, I went just by origin listing so it might help if we could cast the net wider as I found almost exclusively -a names that I think would work :'(

Hebrew names: Adina, Bina, Danya, Dara, Etana, Maya, Micah, Talia

Matter of taste, but most Japanese names without the r sound *can* be pronounced acceptably by English native speakers. Some that probably *will* be pronounced pretty accurately on the first try: Hina, Mina, Mika, Emi, Shina. Some tips might be to avoid a final e and think about how you might pronounce a name if you've never seen an Asian persion in your life. For this reason you may want to pass on an otherwise lovely name like Yumi or Kumiko to forestall embarassment, and anything else where the syllable breaks are unclear like Hinata just because imagining "hin-att-uh" grinds my gears.

Names from both cultures: Hana, Asa, Aya (or maybe Ayami or another elongated version?), Sada(ko), Reina (Japanese and Yiddish), Sara.

I like Mila and Serena! I actually prefer Audrey over Aubrey, but both are pretty cool. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Where'd you get Tiggy from, if you don't mind sharing? I've never heard the nickname before, are you trying to figure out the full name of an acquaintance? The only thing I can thing of is Tiger and variants although those are used pretty exclusively for guys, or maybe from the initials T.G. Or maybe Martica or Nautica? The two Tiggies on Wikipedia are Alexandra and Charlotte, no idea how that follows. Seems like it could be anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is this for a baby or a character? I think Valdawna would be a super cool name for a protagonist in a fantasy novel, but would recommend against naming an actual child that, or probably any of these.

Melloria - this is nice, it sounds like 'melodious' and has cute nn's in Mel and Lori

Azlayna - I'm not a fan, I think because it's almost an anagram of 'lasagna.'

Erindee - don't like it, how about Eris or Iridian?

Marynda - not bad, but reminds me of 'marimba'

Wendilyn - Wendolyn is a real (underrated imo) name and I prefer that spelling.

Ellabeth is a little too close to Elsabeth. How about Elowyn?

Trisabell - sounds too close to Tinkerbell, or Isabell with a tr slapped on... Tristanna or Tristine? I like u/notyourcure's suggestion of Christabel, too. I think something like Trinabel or Tristadel sounds a little less made-up.

Annadella is too close to Annabella, I think. </TEXT>

Zack is nice; I think it's a good idea to use Zachary/Zachariah unless you *really* don't like it to give the kid additional options, plus with most combos I think that would improve the flow of the full name. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In East Asia it's pretty much required to use last names with anyone except close friends and family, maybe it's like that in British boarding school culture too, but I wouldn't have made the connection between the two, it just seems normal in Asian media but comes off a bit posh in British media? I don't really know.

I don't think it's strange in books even though I usually don't do it with friends either, maybe because I read HP when I was pretty young? I do call teachers just their last name when talking about them, and some kids with interesting last names do get called that, it's less of a respect thing more of a nickname thing here though. </TEXT>

It's hard to describe the feeling, but like you said it's a bit unpleasant and jarring. It tends to make me dislike the character a little, even if there's nothing objectively dislikable about them.

<TEXT> Kate is a fine name! I mean, I think Kaitlin pairs better with most of these middle names and would give her additional options later in life, but Kate works perfectly well standalone IMO and she can still go by Kat, Kit, or Katie if she'd like. There's also Katrina (maybe still too soon after the hurricane? :( My cousin has this name, I've always loved it) and Kathleen if you think it's too short. I like Elizabeth best, I agree a longer middle is best with a one-syllable name, actually I'd suggest 3-4 syllables unless your last name is mega long. Ideas:

Kate Alexandra

Kate Marianna

Kate Isabella

Kate Valentina

Kate Juliana

What about Irwin, Kevin, Quentin / Quint, and Felix as more conventional variants of your list? Or Harris, Marley, Harley, Arlo, Hendrik, Hadley, or Harvey as less common variants on his?

<TEXT> OP I am about to write an essay, I apologize in advance.

Mythological: Cassandra, Thalia, Persephone, Calliope, Selena. I really think Andromeda is usable, honestly; depending on where you live a good percentage of the kids may have far stranger/youniquer names. I also think Athena, Sabriel, and Odessa would all stand out much more, especially as Andromeda has a familiar nn (Andie/Andy) while the others do not.

Literary: Man, so many female characters are either bad people, sexistly written, or have a horrible life, I personally like these but opinions will definitely vary on if they're good namesakes or not: Alice, Margaret (from Wrinkle in Time, I've always thought the nn Meg is sweet), Scout (too edgy?), and then Juliet and Ophelia obviously tragic but they're nice names. If you go this route you should probably pick a book and character you personally like.

Games: Well, I'm not sure how I feel about this, even if you avoid anyone who dies or is oversexualized, but some usable ones IMO are Lara, Maya, Kay, Lana, Juniper (...what can I say, I like Ace Attorney), and Clementine.

Old fashioned favs: Rose, Claudia, Irene (or maybe Ida since you like Ada?), Sylvia, Wilhelmina.

Comments on your list: I think Lyra is a lovely name, I would assume it's a reference to His Dark Materials, it's a good series but something to think about. If you're in the US most people will assume Johanna is pronounced like Joanna. I like Lyra, Ada, and Andromeda; Georgia is a liiittle out-of-style still, and that's a lot of G's written out with your last name, but I've always thought Georgie is a cool nn. </TEXT>

I don't think Ash really follows from either Alicia or Anastasia unless you're pronouncing the latter like Anas-tasha?

<TEXT> I'd hit up [babynamewizard](http://www.babynamewizard.com/voyager) to check the trends, you can see for instance Donna and Holly are definitely tied to certain time periods. For Jeanne, which I think is a lovely name, the trend is so long ago that I think you could get away with it again, and of course trends from the late 80s-1990s would be acceptable for you. (Can you not change your first and middle to Jeanne Lee if that's your top pick?) I also worry that I drop this link too much lmao but [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-are-922-unisex-names-in-america-is-yours-one-of-them/) is a list of unisex names sortable by commonness and gender breakdown.

As to the rest:

- Lita - it sounds a bit Hispanic as it's short for Carmelita or Rosalita, but it does sound nice.

- Yvette - 1960's trend and yes I do think it sounds a little bit uptight, although it's a shame because it's pretty stylish.

- Jesse - I see this as a bit more masculine for some reason. Not a bad name, pretty cool. Is a bit of a 1970s-80s trend.

- Roselle - Huh, I have never heard this name. Honestly, it seems very similar to Isabel and even more feminine bc of the flower, what makes you like this better? Also, what do you think of Giselle? That's trendy, but for the 1990s, and IMO a little more mainstream and neutral-sounding.

- Lea - It's a nice name! Not very flashy or anything and will get frequently misspelled to Leah. I would pick this over Lita.

- Serene - ...did you watch Sailor Moon? haha, just Lita and Serena are pretty uncommon and both in the show. I've never heard this variant, it's a bit too unique for my tastes. I think it would get misheard frequently as Serena or Selene, and tbph I like those better.

- Anya - this is pretty feminine imo. It's a fine name, but it's definitely a trend from around 2008 so it may end up sounding young.

- Donna - definitely feminine IMO, it means 'lady'! Also definitely a middle aged lady name, what do you think of Diana? I was going to suggest Dawn or Diane, but apparently they're both also passe :(

- River - indeed hipster, extreme trend right now - actually it looks like more girls are currently getting named that than guys but almost no one had that name at all until this decade.

It seems like you like the on sound from Anya, Donna, and Jeanne - hard to search for, but maybe keep in mind? As well as li'a from Lea and Lita. Some other names based on that: Alana, Sonia, Monica, Veronica, Marguerite, Elise, Cecelia.

Goddammit, I wrote a book lmao, but I hope this helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm, it might help if you added some more criteria - most long names have a nickname! Or even if not, you can usually come up with something viable. For instance Julia doesn't really lend itself to nn's but every one I know gets called Jul/Juls, or you could do Lia. I took it you were looking for pretty common names given your examples, and defined "long" as 3+ syllables. Some of my favorites are:

Girls:

- Valentina or Valerie -> Val

- Olivia -> Liv

- Alexandra -> Lex

- Sophia -> Soph

Guys:

- Zachary -> Zach

- Alexander -> Al, Alex, Xander

- Theodore -> Ted, Theo

And you can't go wrong with classics like William (Will, Bill, Liam), Samuel (Sam), Jonathan (John), or Nicholas (Nick). </TEXT>

I think Lily is also a perfectly respectable name and pairs well with all of your middle name picks except Jolie. (Lilith is SUPER edgy imo, although I'm seeing it surprisingly often. I mean, she's a demon, it's like Abaddon or Jezebel.)

To make sense of the data it would probably help to ask respondents' political affiliation, and you definitely need some kind of control group or at least basis of comparison by asking the same thing about other groups. Also, how old are the people you're talking about? My guesses would be wildly different for a 21-year old Republican and a 50-year-old, unless you're also trying to gauge at the same time how old people think the average Republican is...? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's a super cool name, but I would agree it's not the best for a real person. It looks first of all very fantasy and second of all super masculine, both names seem decidedly male. I don't think anyone's suggested these: Sabine/Sabina, Serena, Seraphina, Gabrielle/Gabriella?


There's also the consideration about how she would feel about the name - I think I'd find it a little weird if I knew my parents named me for a character in an old YA novel, which she would the second she googled her name.


IMO initials don't even matter, if hubs is super bothered by it then it's worth compromising on, but realistically although I'm sure some would notice it spells a word I doubt anyone would bother her about it after, like, first grade. If he's a good dad there is no way in a million years she would think her initials were some weird passive-aggressive message. </TEXT>

<TEXT> TBH I think there are a ton of Korean names that are manageable for English speakers, but very few that actually sound like an English name... I know a Minhee that tolerates "Minnie," not sure if that counts. If you pick the first syllable Jun for girls it can be nicknamed to June, and Jae- -> Jay for guys. (Come to think of it, I know a ton of people that just go by the first syllable of their Korean name.) If you're just looking for pronounceable, Hana and Mina come to mind. Ultimately if you avoid the phonemes that don't exist in English IMO the way most names get pronounced is tolerable, but ig that's a matter of opinion.


There's always the option of picking two names, or picking an English name that's pronounceable in Korean like Sarah.


sorry for the novel, but good luck OP!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Augggh sorry!! On another read I think that came off really rudely. Yeah, it's a pretty word, but in the US you would have to deal with people saying it with the last syllable rhyming with oil and like wah, which I can imagine just being horrible on the ears especially long-term.

<TEXT> If you can't use Quinn, there's a lot of names that rhyme - Brinn, Lin, Flynn, Corinne?

What's wrong with Kara or Gwen? I think those are good picks! Tons of rhymes with Kara if you're looking for similar, Tara and Lara are both cool as well.

The only thing I can think of that sounds remotely like Sage is Paige... but in my humble opinion, ehh Sage is way better.

Rowan: I know a woman named Owen, and then there's Rory and Rose.

Instead of Pandora, maybe something that shortens to Andie? Andrea, Miranda...or Theodora (I love this name and think both Teddy and Theo are super cute nicknames...)

I'm giving you one of my secret favorite names Arin/Aarin as an alternative to Erin. (It'll probably get misspelled but...it's SO cool...) Also sounds a bit like Jenn, Cameron, Kieran. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, no one will be able to pronounce it. (I mean. Apologies if you already know this and were simplifying, but... I gotta point out that the L is in fact pronounced so, ...) Danica/Danique and Estelle are better-established French names also meaning 'star'.

Matching 'et' sound: every name that ends in ette (I love Juliette!), with Etty/Etta as a possible nn

Matching 'oi' sound: hard, but Antoine(tte), Francoise, Loire (pronunciation again but this is in vogue so maybe not for long?) - all also very French

Matching 'ale' sound: Alena, Alexis, Natalia, Valerie </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tiberius Ash is not horrible, especially if you're just writing fanfic? based on the Harry Potter comment, but it kind of has a very "this is a fake name, also I exclusively write YA" feel.

Some of these are good with just two of the names but they all feel super flowery with all three to me. (Of course, with how infrequently it comes up you might not need to worry too much.) For instance, Philipe Rousseau is good (although I like the spelling Phillippe better), but I'd go with a 1-2 syllable middle. I would switch the first and middle for Adrian Hawthorne Talcott, I like that, and also Nathaniel Brett - for surnames, definitely need a nationality. Asher Cohen is fine too. Not a fan of any of the rest, plenty of individual names are great but the combos...eh. </TEXT>

Remi is cute but I'm not sure how well it'd work on an adult; I prefer the spelling Remy. Same for Lumi, I know it's Finnish but in the US it would sound like a nickname, I think. Leonie as well - I prefer Leona or Leonore.

Juno and Petra I love. Rory and Cecily are nice too.

Seems like you really like two-syllable names ending in a long E sound, -ny/-my in particular, maybe you could search by that if you're still looking for options?

<TEXT> Similar to Socorro: Sorrel(l)? That was the first thing that came to mind... I did a search and it looks like Socorro is one of the only names that starts with Soc- or ends with -orro / -oro, which are mostly very very Spanish (Navarro, Teodoro). The sound is very unique! Ezra and Ophelia also mean "help;" Cody means "helpful;" Zahir(a) means "helper".

Nameberry says Lourdes is from the Basque for "craggy slope," which is pretty unique as well. (Very pretty name!) There are a lot of names that sound very similar, like Laurie/Lora, Laurel, Loire, Lorelei, Loren(s/z), maybe Lois or Jordan. And if you would like to connect with Saint Mary there's Mary itself and its many derivatives (I like Miriam, Marisol and Marielle!), and then [here](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Given_names_derived_from_epithets_of_the_Virgin_Mary) is a list of other names derived from Saint Mary.... most of them would sound pretty unusual in English-speaking countries, but I like Vega and Carmen.

<TEXT> Honestly, anyone who balks at a perceived difference between gender and name is being ridiculous IMO. Especially since for names like Elliot there are a TON of famous male Elliots, that's not going to go away just because people are naming their daughters that, so you should just go for it if that's the name you love. It's nothing like naming a son Sue. But even if you did I genuinely, seriously would not even think that was weird, for that particular name.

Same goes for any name that was or could have conceivably have been majority-masculine or gender-neutral at any point in the past; anyone who blinks at a male Leslie or Kelly is being ignorant. I won't say you should just ignore them as you do have to consider your child's well-being, but it's frustrating that you have to accommodate idiots when picking out a name.

Anyway, all this to say that it is obnoxious how misogyny slips into everything! Male names are cool for girls, but strictly female names are bad ideas for boys, socially speaking. Although, I really have to disagree that names like Ryan, Evan, James will ever be majority-female. Gender-neutral maybe, but they're all so established as guy names that I can't imagine it. It would be like John or Peter flipping, it's just too hard to fathom. Like, Ryan has been in the top 50 boy names since the 70s, and people have been naming their daughters that for just as long, and at even higher rates than 2016, but it's still extremely masculine. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Zephryrine I don't think I personally would use just because it's *so* unusual, but it's pretty cool! I like the nickname Zeph far better, though.

Riley is definitely trendy, but I still like it. I think it's cute and don't foresee issues with aging, it sounds young now but that's only because it only became popular as a girl's name recently, so it should 'age' with the cohort. Probably my favorite off this list, given the middle name.

Cirilla is pretty but I don't like it with the middle name and also I would agree that Ciri is at least a little weird now.

I like the name Alice a lot, but you're spot-on that Alice Anya sounds exactly like 'a lasagna'.

It sounds like you're really not sold on any of these, though. These are all so different that I'm not sure what names to suggest, but maybe y'all could spend a few hours with that babyname app or just good old-fashioned going through name books/websites again. </TEXT>

- Dorian - this is associated too much with Picture of Dorian Gray for my tastes. Not a bad name in and of itself though

- Gregor - I like this one too, but pretty likely it'll get constantly mistaken for Gregory.

- Elwood - ehh. I've never heard this before, but it sounds very dated to me.

- Luther - Very cool. Reminds me a bit of Martin Luther/MLK but that's not a bad thing I don't think.

- Grover - Not horrible, but I vote no. The two famous Grovers are the one from Sesame Street and Grover Cleveland, which I'd say are not especially good namesakes. I also don't love the sound.

- Geo - I've never heard this one. I think it is a little too out-there for me. I think this would also get misspelled an awful lot (I'd guess Gio, Jiho, or Jiyo before Geo, personally.)

- Izador - new to me, but I actually like this spelling! Would 100% get spelled as Isidore, though.

- Natal - would not recommend this, it's spelled like a word and a weird word to use as a name. Would you consider a form of Nathaniel instead?

- Benedict - this isn't my style, and forever associated with Benedict Cumberbatch for me, although most likely your kid will never have any idea who that is lmao. Other things to consider: it WILL get shortened to Ben and also most likely kids will, uh. Make fun of the last syllable.

<TEXT> I've always thought that virtue names were kind of kickass, although they're both a bit much and not entirely unheard of, like Courage, Clemency, Justice...

Then just off the top of my head, Sonder, Agate, Beryl, Maroon, Ravine, Chicory, Flame, Hail, Ridge, Heron, Rill, Ember...and then these might ^slightly ^be ^from ^Pokemon but Blue, Red, Fire, Leaf, Silver. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry if this is weird, but I have a character named Valentina Kim, so I'm kind of partial to that. It's a pretty long name, so something simple would balance it out, maybe Joy or May. I like the suggestions of Leigh and Faith also.

As other users have said, it's totally acceptable to skip giving a middle name if you can't find something you like! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took a look but the only name I could find with two separate r's is Karter, which I'm not the biggest fan of. If you're not in love with any of the names suggested, how about doing a first name that starts with a K and a middle name with a double R or something? I think my favorite would be Kerry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's definitely a guy's name, but I don't think I would question it if a woman introduced herself as such! If you like the sound you could also consider Mo(e) or Jo(e) or names that can be shortened to them - Morissa or Josephine, for instance. 538 has an article [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/there-are-922-unisex-names-in-america-is-yours-one-of-them/) where you can look at unisex names and sort them by gender ratio and commonness to get some more ideas, too. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to brush after (or both before and after), but at college I usually eat at the dining halls and then go straight to class, so I have to do it before, and I've gotten in the habit of doing it at home as well. Gum works just as well to get rid of the food taste. As u/PeacefulCamisado said, it's better for your teeth anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the US here. It is recognizable and I know what it looks like. It's definitely not unique, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it shares elements like the union jack, color scheme, and stars with other flags. I might get it confused with NZ's but otherwise yes, I think I would be able to spot it. I like it a lot better than most country flags, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a bit of a hard time answering this one, as I'm half-white, didn't really have a strong cultural upbringing, and plan to adopt older kids if I do decide I want them, so we wouldn't necessarily have the same ethnic background... if they did, I might try to teach them what little I could, otherwise I think I would probably be more concerned with learning about their culture. I imagined the latter scenario, since it seems way more likely given the racial makeup of the foster care system. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friend and I once saw a guy shuffle down the street with his pants literally sagged all the way down to the GROUND, and he was wearing two pairs of boxers that were like, way too big for him, which were green and purple or something equally garish.

Once he passed out of sight, we just looked at each other and absolutely *lost* it to the point of tears for like, 15 minutes, my abs started getting sore by the end of it...I still can't believe anyone would leave the house looking like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> for anyone who's confused, a monolid/single lid is when you have skin over your tearduct and upper eyelid, like so: https://beginnersmakeup.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/monolid_hooded_double.jpg
If you can see your entire upper eyelid, you have double lids. I'm interested to know why OP didn't include questions about nationality, ethnicity, or syndromic disorders :0 I'm not sure what you could do with the data since you don't know what percentage are Asian or where the respondents are from. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The wording of this is extremely loaded; if you get enough results to be statistically significant you're almost definitely going to end up skewed towards "freedom of speech" because it's a much more positive wording. As a person who would argue that freedom of speech is not the most important freedom and there needs to be restrictions on hate speech - I don't say that because I love "political correctness" but because I care more about the people hurt by hateful opinions than the abstract idea of absolute freedom of speech. I've never once in my life seen anyone arguing for "more political correctness" with that phrasing, whereas people arguing for more freedom of speech are a dime a dozen.

You would probably get better results asking if there are any circumstances in which freedom of speech could ethically be curtailed. Or replace "political correctness" with something more neutral like "ensuring civil public discourse," "preventing hate speech," etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Posting photos of you, especially photos that are JUST of you, without even asking first. There are a lot of pics of me on facebook which I find hyper ugly, and people take so much offense when I ask them to delete them!! I always discuss with anyone else before putting them on social media and I feel like that's the way it should be - posts on the internet are forever and it takes 10 seconds to shoot a text like "yo can I post this pic from tonight". </TEXT>
