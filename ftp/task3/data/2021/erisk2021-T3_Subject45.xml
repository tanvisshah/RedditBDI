Did Fallout 76 lose a bit of player base because of a leak? Maybe. But it wasn't because it got leaked, but  because it was a multiplayer game of fallout that nobody asked for.

<TEXT> jezz, the games is not even out yet and you're talking about monopolizing the whole genre lol.

Western games are niche. RPG games are not, even if cyberpunk genre itself is kind of niche.

Also the only reason Skyrim is so popular is because of the mods and very simplified game to the point of being boring repetitive open world RPG that anybody can like (People like simple things and are boring)

Anyways, in my opinion this kind of hype will hurt the game itself. Witcher 3 was underdog, Cyberpunk is not and we can't know how it will do, until the launch itself. It can be a masterpiece like Blade Runner 2049 and become **THE** game of decade because it had fuck tons of hype unlike the movie.  Or it can be disappointment like No man's sky and fall off the cliff real quick. Or something in between </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like it, **but** Villarreal are doing pretty badly so really can't judge full performance yet. Going to have to wait until both away games and see how they play against better opposition.

My main doubt is the integrity of the defence, we were opened quite a bit in the half but VIllareal couldn't capitalize on it due their bad passing.

Roberto and Griezmann are the only weak links currently </TEXT>

<TEXT> How many people have actually read the article?

Anyways, I would actually agree that the game was **too** long, because it was just unnecessary to big. In my personal opinion, the fact that they made game this big open world wise, cluttered with my opinion unimportant loot meant that they couldn't focus on main story more. Hence pretty rushed ACT 3 with things not making sense, and quests being shorter than they should be.

EDIT: IT also suffered from pacing, which was also another obvious downside of the game </TEXT>

<TEXT> Valve's MMR system is very good imo.

Your first mistake was counting the win ratio, instead of round win ratio. Also you've no idea of knowing what kind of elo opponents you're facing.

System would be broken if they start ranking you up after winning 200 games in same rank consistently, and then ranking you up after few wins in a row </TEXT>

Kingdoms of Amalur I also didn't enjoy, because it felt like a basically offline mmorpg.

Added  Tacoma, Eastshade and Gone Home  to list of games I should check out, thanks.

Indigo Prophecy was awesome game... Until the ending. Never bothered to finish with how awful it was in the last act. Beyond:Two Souls looks interesting though.

Neverwinter nights were pretty good games, I agree. Forgot to add them to the list.

Thank you very much for all of those suggestions :P Added few games to the 'to play' list

EDIT: I can't believe I forgot to add Far Cry 3 to the list that I enjoyed it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Off we go then, 5 in the morning and then 5 in the evening before Champions League.

# 1 Case:  Dust II

**Verdict**: Cheater. Bhop script and wallhacks. Quite obvious from the first round as suspect didn't try to hide it. Some signs of aim assistance but not enough for conviction.

# 2 Case: Mirage

**Verdict:** Cheater. BHOP script, wallhacks and aimlock+triggerbot. Whole package this guy has.

# 3 Case: Dust II

**Verdict:** Cheater. Overslept first round where I think suspect got double kill through mid doors so I was worried I'll have to restart the demo. But good guy suspect showed off his nice walls next round, with an extra spice of aimlock.

# 4 Case: Nuke

**Verdict**: Cheater. Wallhack and most likely had aim assistance with low fov. It wasn't 100% clear, but in my personal opinion it was beyond reasonable doubt, with the shots he hit and also him clearly having walls.

# 5 Case: Mirage

**Verdict:** Blatant cheater. Suspect was as blatant as you could be without spinbot, also most likely was premade with another cheater. Or enemies got unlucky and got queued up against two separate soloq cheaters </TEXT>

I was informed few times by people I've played with that my trust factor is yellow. I've 1500 hours, a tiny bit of commendations and couple years old steam account. I never do anything flashy enough to warrant reports, but people still report me because that's how MM works. (WTF does 'flashy' even stand for in this context)

AS these things are taken into consideration when measuring someone's trust(Also WTF do you get this from) I would say that my trust factor is very, very average. I've never met blatant spinbot in my \~250 games that I've played in high ranks (I'm LEM, but often I queue up against Supreme's/Global's when queueing solo which is always)  Also beforing selling my years old main account was Global, also never met any spinbots or blatant cheaters in Prime.  And that was account with over 1k games!

I accept that there might be big cheating problem at high ranks, there have always been. What I don't accept is you knowing that you've high trust factor, while you obviously don't. </TEXT>

My trust factor must be not high enough for cheaters :<

Also people with Walls can't hide shit. And no legit cheater worth their salt would use walls, instead of for example radar cheat. You don't "fool" overwatch because you check couple corners.

I agree that high FOV aimbots are harder to detect on overwatch, especially if skilled player is using it. Aimlocks/Triggers are pretty easy to detect though. </TEXT>

Play scrimmage, you don't want to? Well good job, you're a hypocrite who only cares about your own experience. Nobody wants to play against smurfs, and I don't think they would care if the excuse was "Chill, I'm just playing with friends"

Yeah, I admit scrimmage might be lacking but don't  act defensively when people criticise  you.

It's more likely that your teammates have even worse trust factor than you, doesn't make your trust a good one.

<TEXT> I know that results will be better with 8 gb, but I don't want to spend money on any kind of PC upgrades because I'm playing less and less.

I kind of have the basic grasp how ram works, it stores the game map memory and uses when it needs to, and HDD is being used as a replacement if PC doesn't have enough RAM.

So what I'm looking, is for advice on what kind of games should I avoid that are either poorly optimized, or load maps in such a way that it won't run on even low settings </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yoo, I wanted to ask how plausible this is.

My current setup is: GTX 1060 3GB / Ryzen 5 1600.  Also sadly using HDD.

I wonder what kind of modern games I'm able to play on native resolution ( 1440\*900) , which basically how stronger my gpu and cpu need to me compared to minimum requirements so as lack of ram wouldn't be noticeable.

For example Fallout 4 is playable on high with stable FPS, meanwhile Greedfall isn't very stable on lowest settings on native res , and andromeda 'surprisingly' doesn't run at all. </TEXT>

Edit: It seems like that post agrees more with me, it was lack of support from other players and tactics  that made Semedo look terrible.

<TEXT> tbf, I've stopped watching after 6-2 so I didn't see those two, but I wouldn't hold it on him anyways. The game was over by then.

Don't see how you can blame him for 2-6 goal. Everybody was awful there.

Yeah I'll give you 1-4 one.

1-0 isn't his sole blame also.

What was abysmal was lack of the support he got on that right flank.  It's beyond idiotic to single out his perfomance, because both Sergi and Busquets should've done better in helping him out.

1 goal that was solely on him out of 8, and him being scapegoated is something else tbh. It's stupid </TEXT>

<TEXT> What game were you watching? How many times did he gave away ball which lead to dangerous counter attack? I think it was like 5 at the first half alone.

Even if you think Ter Stegen deserves praise, it was midfield who fucked up even more, not our back line.  However it was also Ter Stegens responsibility to distribute ball safely, or just kick it out.

Compare his distribution to Neuer's last game. It was night and day difference. He was out of it mentally last game. I'm putting him into the same category as Lenglet, Suarez, Sergi and Busquets for that game. </TEXT>

Our defence is sleeping, what's the point of 3 holding mid's if nobody supports Pique and Lenglet who are getting destroyed. Semedo and Alba are terrible. Sergi Roberto is even more so.

Setien can go,he fucked up  but the problem are also the players. I hope they'll be ashamed after this.

Possession football my ass. Can't even control ball more than couple touches because our midfield is getting overloaded.

You get your rank removed if cheater gets banned quite quickly after the game, due to the fact that you didn't gain/lose as much elo compared to if he gets banned way later.

That would make sense, and my anecdotal evidence helps with that hypothesis. Because after losing quite a few matches in a row, I waited for couple months until people get banned, and then I ranked up quite swiftly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course it's possible to get Global solo, yeah. I've never managed to do that though, and had to get some people to play with(Best decision I've ever made, because those people were awesome) because the sheer amount of wins you need to get from supreme to global is insane, if you've played a lot of games on that account.

As for the cheater topic, that depends on your trust factor tbh. And funnily enough, I've got more cheaters caught in lower ranks than in higher ranks(playing with same account, got from dmg to lem, and like 90% cheaters were in mge-dmg ranks)

Whether that's because those guys are bad at hiding it, or my trust factor improved, I wouldn't know. I'm naively hoping it's the latter :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> True. The main reason I like to soloq, because I meet so many different people in terms of personalities, it's kind of incredible.

There's also a fact that some people might not want to bother to look for other people and just want to get games quickly.

But yeah, this guide can be summarised as:  Don't soloq, but if you do for some reason decide to, here are some tips to potentially improve your experience </TEXT>

<TEXT> Atalanta individually are obviously the weakest team remaining, so I don't see them going further than semi-finals.  Great effort from them anyways though.

This PSG team is just sad though. There's no creativity besides Neymar, who has to do everything by himself while getting fouled every time.  Without Mbappe, they won't win this but PSG **should** win even without him imo </TEXT>

<TITLE> A few tips on how to improve your chances if you soloq. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-08-12 18:52:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Right, let’s get straight to it and let’s start from basics.

* I’ll start by a sincere recommendation for your mental sake - Don’t solo queue. SoloQ is very similar to gambling in a way, and one of the biggest similarities is that probabilities are against you. If you decide to soloq after all, the most important tip I could give you is… Be prepared to lose. Shit will happen, you will get teammates who will be toxic, you will get teammates who will throw. But it’s very important for that not to affect you, because if it does - It’s game over. And if it does affect you, you’re better off finding people in places like /r/recruitcs. Soloq won’t improve, internet anonymity makes people assholes and there’s nothing anybody can do about it.
* When talking about people, a lot of people recommend adding people that you’ve played with in the game and more importantly - enjoyed playing with. I want to add something to that tip, in particular who you actually add. I find teammates who you’ve added after winning very easily the most risky ones, because there’s such a freaking huge contrast between people while they are winning and losing, it’s kind of incredible. So I would doublethink about adding people after very easy victories. Closest games where you either win/tie/lose are the best choice for adding people. Also due to the nature of MM, I would avoid adding people who destroy your enemies. You’ll never know whether they’re cheating or not.
* People, people, people. They suck, don’t they? Anyways, you should start the pistol round by being the first one to say hello in English. It’s important to be the first one, because then foreign people might be less inclined to ask whether anybody is speaking their language, and it might make the game easier to deal with. Also on T side, it’s best to call a simple pistol round strat, but don’t get too over-complicated.
* When it comes to language, it’s important not to get too defensive if your teammates start speaking in foreign language you don’t understand. My advice if they do? Let them. As long as they don’t forget to say info out loud (CS is a universal game after all, even for example info given out in Russian or Portuguese will still be easily understood.)  You’re free to ask them to speak in English, but I wouldn’t risk it because you don’t know what kind of person you’re playing with. Just don’t bother, passivity is very important while you’re in soloq, and you don’t want to pick fights over silly things like language. You’re not here to socialize after all, so does it really matter what language they speak?
* Be passive, passive, passive. Do not pick fights, no matter what - Even if you’re right. If somebody criticizes you - say you’re sorry. That’s it.  There’s no need to defend yourself, and if people are angry - It’s better off to just let them let off steam. I find that to work way better than trying to prove somebody you’re right. Those guys are just randoms, you don’t know them, don’t pretend to understand how their mind works. It’s better off to just kind of manipulate them, and be the one who loses arguments.  I also find it better to stay out of any arguments that take place, and if you do decide for some reason to join the argument (i.e It didn’t stop after a few rounds) be sure to take one side. It’s better to let one person get angry at you, than two. 4vs5 in the worst case scenario is winnable. 3vs5 is a lot harder.
* Best way to make friends is to drop AWP. I'm not kidding, people will like you more if you drop them awp when they ask, and might legit get mad if you don't. Doesn't matter if the person sucks, just drop it to him.
* Now that I’ve finished talking about other people - It’s now time to talk about you, and what you can do, to improve your chances to win the soloq game - Learn how to use radar. Simple as that, and there’s nothing more that you need to do. Radar is such an amazing and super useful tool, even with good teammates, it’s necessary to learn how to use it properly. It will save you, trust me on this. And learning how to use radar will mix-in well with my language tip.

Those tips just came to top of my head, and there are probably a lot more. Hopefully those will help you as much as they did to me, in my a lot of years of soloq experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really depends on what you're looking for tbh.

If you want a good story, but don't care about gameplay **that** much start from Witcher 1.

If you want a good story,  and also care about gameplay, start from Witcher 2. That game has imo best story out of all games, but keep in mind that story decisions won't matter much in Witcher 3. And one major path of the storyline was entirely cut off from Witcher 3 which freaking sucked. But that game deserves it's own playthrough even if that's the case.

Witcher 3 has the best gameplay, and graphics. And even then Combat is very clunky, and open world is basically a modern open world of quantity > quality. Where it's shines though, is  in it's characters and side quests. Main plot is very underwhelming though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I already mentioned, just because one specific race was chosen for extermination, doesn't make it worse thaneverything that happened in history. Not to mention, that Nazi Germans hated everything that wasn't Arian, and jews were just a political scapegoat due to social views of that decade Europe.

Romans also looked down upon "Barbarians" aka each and every European cultures that weren't Roman.Difference is, that we don't have other side view on it.

French revolution was caused by such a huge economical equality, it might as well have been Nobles abusing poor until death, because thats what Absolutism was. Not genocide, but not way better thing.

My point of all this is, Nazi genocide isn't THE worst thing done in our history,  and we shouldn't shy away from making stuff about it just because it was the most recent. As long as the game doesn't deny holocaust or reduce its importance, I see nothing wrong. We don't learn by just forgetting about it </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, that this kind of post doesn't bring discussion, and also way too detailed. A review of plot and basic gameplay ideas would've been both shorter and better, with potential for more discussions. This is just too much.

But let's not kid ourselves that what we write or our ideas matter in Reddit. We're very small demographic in everything, starting from politics ending with... games. </TEXT>

Unity: How is French Revolution not a sign of 'really bad to live'? it happened precisely because on how fucked up absolutism was.

Origins: Romans conquests and oppression of conquered nations.

Odyssey: Slaves, war, femine...

Yes, all of those might pale in comparison to WW2 in terms of mere numbers, but besides technology and the casualties it caused nothing new happened in WW2. </TEXT>

The thing is, the idea of microchips and current anti-Bill Gates vaccine conspiracy theories go hand by hand, which is why I think this post was very close to still being anti-vax, due to how he was defending his choice of sharing the video. Now I haven't watched the video itself, and I saw people commenting that person might not be entirely anti-vaxers so who knows tbh at this day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heey, got miband 4 ages ago, first week everything was fine, but then I got skin rash around whole area I was wearing my watch.

Stopped wearing it and couple days ago I decided to wear it and after a while skin rash appeared again. Interestingly I think rash appeared after enabling heart sensors all the time. Though I'm not sure, and I don't really test it because rash lasts quite a while even after stopping wearing the watch.

Is it just my skin being sensitive, or is actually possible that specific settings cause rash? </TEXT>

Both Ferrari's and Red Bulls dominance were ended by changing rules based on their weak points.

What is the weak point of current Mercedes? Next year might be closer because DAS is getting banned, and it seems like this gives a lot of  advantage for Mercedes. Tyre temperature is real problem in current F1 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I disagree. Only small part of the flame has stayed in Clarke's neural mesh, and I don't think that part had any of Cadogans daughter's memories. That's why Clarke had to bluff her way out.

She didn't have mind drive before taking the flame or the chip, so that one is irrelevant.

She knew how to get Madi because she remembered how love is important, and she knew both Madi and Lexa loved her and wouldn't have let her come to harm. Also irrelevant to being a key.

Madi, is so far the only possible key. Because of the reasons you mentioned, but not Clarke. </TEXT>

B) Because of the Season 3. They saw from Octavias eyes how Claire was connected to the Flame. This is where all assumptions came from. They didn't get to Madi time period, so they've no idea. </TEXT>

Echo... Maybe? She has the nightblood, some grounders might listen to her. I don't think we've a lot, if any Azgeda left though.

<TEXT> I am sorry, are you trying to look for ways to redeem Sheidheda after this episode? What even.

All he wants is power, doesn't matter what stands in a way. He'll manipulate, he'll kill innocents, he'll do everything to gain power. How can a person like that be anything but villain?

As for your points... What a mess, no offense.

1) Indra had an amazing character growth, we shouldn't judge her character on what she said in S2. Especially as this was straight after Skaikru massacred her people, mind you they **were at war**, so Skaikru(100) actions were excusable.

2) He manipulated a child, it doesn't matter for what reason, in no way that sort of a thing should fly. (He wanted her to kill everybody, so he can take control, and when she refused he took over and Madi had no self-freedom at that point)

3) It all comes down whether a culture like the grounder one is worth saving. I'd say no, it's a culture based on war and fighting. Lexa tried to revolutionize Grounders so they would know peace is also an option and she was close to being successful, but  was killed by stray bullet.

You like character - that's great, Sheidheda is very interesting personality. But he's nowhere close to being good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lack of coherent plot, shoe-horned prequel stuff, boring side characters.

I enjoyed the early season which focused on side characters and fleshed them out more, but cmon it's 2nd half of the season now, and we're still focusing on them?

Also I'm disappointed with the way they're going in regards 'Last War' plot, I was really hoping it's not going to be a literal war, and they'll think of something more interesting but it looks like they're heading to straight forward battles.

I just don't enjoy season anymore, first few episodes were amazing but it seems... very stale now. I want to say that it's going to improve, but I learned my lesson from GOT and I don't expect much. </TEXT>

After him, no other ruler converted to Christianity besides Vytautas, and so didn't get crowned by pope to become a king. (Vytautas did, but he died before the crown could arrive to him. Interesting theories about that)

<TEXT> Heeeeeeey, I'm looking for games where major characters are not just black and white good/evil and have inner conflicts in them and their actions are not only good, or only evil  / motivations only good or evil, you get it. Or I hope you get it.  Basically where one side isn't 100% good and other 100% bad.

Don't suggest obsidian / bethesda / bioware games, i've already play through probably all of the games made by those studios. Not looking for Witcher 3 suggestion either, or any of the popular ones made in here.

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just wanted to get my feelings out, this was the first episode of the season that I didn't enjoy.

Lore felt like it was there, just because it needed to be. All the explanations seemed shoehorned in. Maybe it was because I just didn't enjoy the characters of the potential prequel. I really was waiting to get to know more about the in-universe world of the 100, but all we got cliche brother vs sister rivalry.

Can't wait until we return to the current timeline, with the way prequel was set-up, It doesn't look like something I'll enjoy it and I hope they didn't focus too much on me (for me - sadly, it looks like it will because this episode wasn't here for a reason, and we'll return to those characters) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cadogan didn't like being called Shepherd.

It makes me think that he didn't like being hailed as the somewhat a Jesus figure, but by the time he wake up from Cryo by Anders, it was too late. Or maybe it was just a method to prepare for the last war.

I've a feeling we will find out that Cadogan is not nearly as bad as some theorised. </TEXT>

Question  - We see Becca saying "I've to shut it down"... But wasn't she at the Polaris when the nukes fell? I don't think shutting down Allie would matter at that point... Though I guess there was possibility of Allie launching nuke to Ark, depending on the technological capabilities of them.

Cadogan doesn't look like the bad guy too me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's what he did at the beginning, that's true. But nowadays it's very rare of him to actually contribute to team play because there's too much pressure on his shoulders.  I feel like he also was better overall with the ball and passing at the early stint, but a couple mistakes and fans pressure ruined him.

It's not his fault, it's our board. For buying players to play them in wrong positions instead of natural ones.  Happened with Coutinho (Bought as a replacement for Iniesta, then moved to the left after his morale dropped) too.

There's also the fact that neither Messi, nor Suarez or anyone else are looking to play combo with him. Messi prefers to look for either Alba or Suarez. There's a bit of bias there, and he might also trust them more </TEXT>

<TEXT> Of course, if I didn't know why Bob isn't on the show as much as before, I would've asked a question, but I do so that's irrelevant.

**ALL** main characters are not as prominent this season, and frankly with how good side characters are this season, I didn't notice nor Bellamy's nor Clarke's absence that much.

Anything more than that, it's not possible to talk about any kind of progression. So far I'm very satisfied with the way show is going and the only quirks that I've, weren't going to be part of Bellamy's story in the first place anyways.  Whether the ending is going to be satisfying and how progression towards that ending will accelerate is another question, and one I can't answer until I see how it actually happens.

FYI: The fans were alarmed and were going nuts before the explanation, and because of his absence on poster. Not due to his lack of screen time. Fanatics who only care about a character or ships will still be not happy with it, but any reasonable person should understand why it happened and enjoy the show if the story is good, and don't let one person's absence ruin it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a plot hole with this theory though. Majority of the storyline happened before Praimfaya, and I can't think of anything that happened to Clarke in S5 that could've made her important. Unless it's a mix of flame + city of light + nightblood.

If Clarke was the key and they were observing her on Earth - Why wait? My guess would be that nuclear bombs were the ones responsible for loss of anomaly stone, not Preimfaya </TEXT>

No, they don't. The only knowledge we've of where the planets are located is them saying that Sky Ring is the only planet that is so far away from black hole, time dilation affects it a lot more noticeably.

Yeah, I keep confusing slower/faster time due to proximity to black hole, but that's not even the point.

> Yes, both planetary system could be in the Milky way

What do you mean, could be? There's no way that they reached different galaxy. That sounds something like would require explanation by S06.  Earth and Sanctum both don't need necessarily have the same distance to black hole, time dilation is just not that noticeable. Otherwise Prime timeline doesn't really make sense. </TEXT>

Anyways, Echo was still way weaker fighter than Roan/Lexa/Luna, though better than average soldier of Grounders. Current Octavia would beat Echo imo, with the way show went with her arc. Also don't forget that Hope was taught by L7 and she still managed to beat Echo, whether that's natural talent or showcase on how good Anomaly people actually are, I don't know.

Counter-arguments about what I wrote is that intentionally losing would be quite smart from Echo and we might not know how good she's actually at fighting melee, but we know she can manipulate people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> tbf for Jason, before starting this he wrote the story for 5 seasons only. Also being a good writer and having amazing ideas isn't the same thing, it's entirely possible that the person you mention enabled Jason and those things both improved the show.

I'd also that finale of S6 was pretty weak, but it was basically used as a set up for S7 - Basically a weaker, but similiar version of S1.

Don't forget that the writers also have to work around the actors availability: Lexa, Lincoln(A bit different) Kane, Shaw were all killed because the actors themselves wanted different job and they were forced to re-write around that.  And there's Bellamy with unfortunate leg injury in S6 and other real life stuff in S7 getting in a way </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see some parallels with Finn when in regards to Echo. Do anything to find somebody and fuck the consequences. Hopefully she won't go down the same route.

What she said was truth though, Orlando did care about the anomaly people more than Echo and Gabriel. And he was also pretty committed at the whole discipline thing. Heck the reason he got to Skyring was because he worked **too** hard for the Shepherd. I think he would've betrayed them quite quickly himself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> > but became a much better character in late season one, and all of season two. Now he seems to be going back to being a tool.

Sorry, what? The guy spent whole second season as a "tool" and caring only about saving his people. That's what his character is about, protecting the people, no matter the cost. He didn't have a lot of good experience with grounders, and the only good one betrayed him and killed his girlfriend and 20 different people.

>  They didn’t expect to survive a fight against one clan before

Why do you expect rationality, from a character who doesn't have one? His own people were massacred by the grounders, his whole experience was survival and now he gets access to guns and people. Of course he will use that. Also the one only major interaction Camp Jaha people had with grounders was watching them trying to burn their own citizen. They didn't trust them and were easily swayed by words. That's real world in a nutshell </TEXT>

<TEXT> Second Dawn was anti-tech, but it's entirely possible that Cadogan himself wasn't anti-tech necessarily.

I don't know why, but my guess would that the last war they're talking about is going to be against an AI.

Would be polar opposites, don't you think? Becca being worshipped by grounders who worship AI technology but are anti-tech, and Cadogan being worshipped by sky people who worship the man himself, and are pro-tech.

That would be quite a turn around </TEXT>

<TEXT> Anyways, not sure how I feel about the episode. Feels like they're fast-forwarding everything in Sanctum so both storylines could merge faster. I like anomaly stuff way more anyways, but it's a little bit weird how different pace is while comparing the storylines.

I did enjoy the episode itself though.

Bardo people think that Shepherd has saved them all, but it was very ambiguous whether that guy is still alive. And I wonder if those guys in Bardo are actual colonists or the people part of the main ship that was supposed to get back to earth after dropping them off. Maybe they combined their forces? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Those are some serious mental gymnastics you did there. I've no idea where did you get the idea that I meant what you quoted.

Core game mechanics were balanced towards SP first and foremost ever since the game launched, which makes sense. But in the past updates they used their dev clashes to balance the game, which I don't think either group should be happy with because the quality decreased quite significantly since the new lead developer took the place for both SP and "Serious" MP

I seriously have no idea why you're mad that I mentioned that majority of people play SP EU4 </TEXT>

On one hand, Bellamy spent way less time with Clarke than Echo, so logically it would make more sense if he cares about Echo more.

On the other hand, the time he spent with Clarke was way more um... Intimate? Not necessary in erotic way, but they suffered and dealt with a lot more things together than Bellamy and Echo.

I am sorry, could you show which part of my quote means that only 2 relationships are rushed?

The thing is, Clarke and Lexa had a lot of interactions, each were important part of their relationship forming.  If this isn't proper development of relationship, then I don't think there's any relationship in a show that could satisfy you (oh wait...) Their romance couldn't continue because of plot and real life reasons.

> I'm all in for arguing with you about how rushed or not some couples, but if for some reason you don't want to talk about Bellarke and Becho when my comment was about these two couples in the first place, then why did you bother to comment at all?

Because that wasn't the part of your comment that I disagreed. Jesus. How can we have any proper discussion when you misunderstood my first overall response?   You can't just take random excerpts from my comments and use your arguments against them. </TEXT>

2. Does every text reply have consequences, or just specific key messages matter?

<TEXT> F)  Those guys are brainwashed since their childhood that Primes are Gods. What's so strange about them continuing following that same mindset? It's not easy to change your perceptions of the world you grew up with, when you're adult. And don't forget that a lot of non-believers were killed during the purifying due to toxin.

H) The guy doesn't have real world experience at all, and has been taught to do better. It makes perfect sense why he's being so naive, and why is he trying to do things the way he does. His character is annoying but makes perfect sense

I) I'm a bit annoyed by a lot of people complaining about this tbh. It's almost like it's hard for some people to comprehend that only 2 days has passed since EP1, and nobody even knows that anomaly is down, let alone that everybody is missing from that group. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But why do we need variety for the sake of it? We know she's pretty smart, also very knowledgeable due to all training she received by Octavia and Diyoza + Somebody from anomaly, she also survived for god knows how long as a kid alone, I seriously don't see how that's in any way a happy childhood.

She also showed affection for somebody that she spent a lot of time, which shows that even if she looks hardened, she can be soft.

So from one episode we know she's intelligent, is good at fighting and survival,  has emotions and doesn't necessary try to hide them, is determined.  I'd say that's good enough depth for one episode </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what the creator of ECL(European Community League) a.k.a houngougagne announced in Discord:

 Hey  u/everyone   Here we are again. Faceit is limiting our services by restricting APi's accesses. It has been a constant battle in the past year with our devs actively trying to find ways to work around but this time, this is the endgame.  Earlier today, they took down the  **Oauth2** feature which only affects logins.

>This means, the LOGIN on ecl.gg is down. **We can't login, you can't submit reports, we can't access the report history, it's all down.**

This is coming out of nowhere, we haven't been warned. But most importantly, that's not all.  They've mentionned that **within a week**, they intend to disabled the entire api:  api.faceit.com.  & reroute to open.faceit.com. Now the problem with this is the new one:  open.faceit.com does NOT have the features necessary. here's a list of features that will go down without this:

>if faceit blocks the api stuff for developers, they have to use the open API, those features won't be possible: -  Support site -  Reports - Auto bans & unbans - ban upgrader  - chatbot - autovoip (switch me) - matches history

And there's more. Basically, out of the blue, we lose all of our tech. Once again. I'm upset. I'm very upset indeed and I really wish they would work with with US and not against us.  It's been like this for quite some time, building up to today's events. It's been a lot of stress for everyone as we never know what they'll change the next day and fuck us up in the meantime.  Our hands are tied. I've reached out to them already and hope for a resolution but as it is today, if they don't revert those changes it might just be the end of Faceit leagues. Not just us. Anyone using any kind of tech based on the API will be left out with an extremely limited API.  So what to do?  Well, besides tweeting at them, trying to shake things up, I really don't know.  I'm sorry for the disturbance in the services in the upcoming days, we really do try our best but that's not even in our hands at this point. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the first post where I disagreed with everything that has been said.

I seriously have no idea what the age gap has to do with the relationship that Clarke and Madi formed while being alone in the world for years and Clarke helping Madi grow up and mature. It couldn't matter more how they view each other, because the only thing that's important is that they love each other more than anybody else.

Murphy a good guy? It's debatable that he's currently on the way to becoming one, but he's still pretty far away from being called a good guy. Charisma and good don't have to come together.

Humans have been fighting for all their history,  alliances you're talking about we're because of mutual gains against common foe. Fuck our very  first ancestors destroyed a race of humans with interelationships **AND** fighting.

I'm also surprised that you can already make a point on what the season message is within 2 episodes. It's kind of terrific </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, because after every commander's death his memories are being copied into flame, and AI uses it to help next commander - It's entirely possible that Sheidheda tried to overtake next commander, hence the ritual or flamekeepers decided to find a way to remove his memories all together as a pre-emptive strike. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mind drives that Eligius are using are a way to store their memories inside them, and can only store one mind at the time.

The flame that's being used by commanders not only holds A.I and Becca. It can also hold multiple minds at the same time, something that no Eligius mind drives can do </TEXT>

<TEXT> What a great episode! I think I enjoyed it a little bit more than first episode. Love the sci-fi storyline more than Sanctum civil war, but I enjoy Sanctum characters more than this storyline characters(Though Gabriel is amazing, and Hope with Echo doesn't fall much behind) I guess the good thing with that is that I'll be able to enjoy each episode if they decide to continue splitting it up until they meet together.  What I like about this season so far is that what were side characters before are getting fleshed out more (Miller / Gaia / Echo) </TEXT>

Season 2: Nothing really

Season 3: Pike. Nuff said

Season 4 : Peace talks, but it's impossible to achieve so sky people are playing with both sides unsuccesfully.

Season 5: hm, I guess Diyozas's peace talk counts...? Murphy ruined it, cant blame him tho.

Season 6: Yeaah all the peace talks were kind of ruined after killing Clarke

So basically only in S4 and S3 that peace negotiations were ruined by small or not so small group in case of Pike </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi, thanks for all the 128 people who spent their time doing the survey! Was pleasure to read through all the answers, and here are the results for the surveys. Some questions I asked were too difficult to categorize into graphs(Something to keep in my for myself) , but I'll leave the link at the end if you want to check out the answers! So without further ado, here's the final survey data which majority of it were made into pies for some reason...(I suppose I consciously  like pies... I think) Hopefully you enjoyed completing the survey just as much as I enjoyed thinking of random unrelated questions! And now hopefully you will continue your enjoyment in checking out how different or similiar your opinion is compared to 128 people of the subreddit (uhhh out of **64 000**)

# [https://imgur.com/a/iAu3LW9](https://imgur.com/a/iAu3LW9)

Couple notes, out of the things that I've noticed is that I formulated some questions wrong or with kind of broken english. For example the anomaly question would've been better and more understandable if I change self-independent to autonomous, and the conclave question wasn't very clear on my part, sooo sorry!

Also not all of the answers are in the pictures, I decided to exclude those who had 3 or less than 3 votes but I compiled a list so I can provide all the candidates:

**Others (Best Villain):**

<TITLE> A theory regarding Cadogan and the anomaly. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-05-17 12:57:04 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The one question we don't have answer yet regarding grounders, is why Becca the one who's being worshipped instead of Cadogan - After all, he was the one who was the leader of the cult that grounders themselves originated from. Yes, Becca was the one responsible for nightblood, but I don't think a cult leader would've wanted her to become a god-like figure for all the cult so there was either in-fighting in the cult that resulted in Cadogan and his non-nightblood faction being destroyed and forgotten about and Becca becoming martyr of the grounders **OR** Cadogan not being there anymore in the first place.

For this theory to work, I'll assume that 6th anomaly planet is the Earth and Cadogan was the one who took nightblood first. What if after nukes fell, Cadogan found an anomaly and got sucked into it? The question would be, why isn't anomaly there anymore, and my answer would be that Cadogan somehow managed to get control of the anomaly and removed the gateway from Earth.  Heck, it's entirely possible that he brought the most loyal followers together with him, which would why he's not in the history **at all,** and where did anomaly people came from.


I know this theory is based on a lot of assumptions, but I'm super curious as to why Cadogan isn't talked at all by the grounders, but Becca is. </TEXT>

I'd like to add that you should vote for character which is better plotwise, not necessary which actor you like more.  Let's begin and I hope there's going to be a lot of activity!

<TITLE> What The 100 lacked in Season 3 and 5 were the flashbacks. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-05-14 22:35:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The major criticism of both of these seasons seem to be the characters, and the way some characters acted during both of the seasons.
What I mean by the title is that not only it lacked more flashbacks, they were also too late for some of the characters ( Pike and Octavia)

**Season 3** Pike was hated because of his straight up evil acts against grounders, and it was hard for viewers to understand why he did and where did his distrust came from.  Couple flashbacks of what actually happened, and what they had to endure against Ice Nation would've been helpful to give Pike some more depth instead of him being crazy guy that created uneccessary conflict with Grounders. Also in my opinion his ark flashback came way too late, and people had already made up the mind about him and that minimal attempt of redemption failed very much so.

**Season 5**  Also suffered from the lack of flashbacks, and the ones that came were also too late when the character(Octavia)  already became non-redeemable in my opinion villain of the season. It's hard for viewers to remember the fact that 6 years have passed, and so some of the motivation for actions didn't make sense for them and it made them think characters were acting OOC. Major Example of flashbacks that would've helped would be between Clarke and Madi and from those who were on space, to at least show how much they changed.  The Dark Year episode should've been an earlier episode, so viewers can understand why Octavia changed, instead of already focused dislike for the actions she made. </TEXT>

<TITLE> First impressions after the first played game. EU </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-04-08 11:11:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a long time CS player who has reached Global but is nowhere near that good. Here are my impressions so far:

Sound is very good, guns sound sexy and I could hear footsteps very clearly. Didn't miss those a bit annoying ambient sounds of CS.

Artstyle is amazing, I thought I didn't like it but it has a good mix of realistic and cartoon feeling.

A lot of the kills were with guns, and most of the abilities were used only for support, which I liked.

One thing that is dissapointing is a lack of communications. I expected a bit better because the only guy who had mic ended up on the other team due to 2 dodges in a row.

Also it's not CS. Noteable lack of shoulder peeking will hurt to play against strong awp.  Slowing down while shot is nice, but I wouldn't want that in CS. Also no counter strafing which sucks a bit but liveable.


To conclude this, it has great potential. I'll play a lot of Beta, but I don't think this is the game that'll move me away from CS </TEXT>

If an answer is no, then which countries are included in Russia region? If it's CIS only, does that also include Baltics for some reason, or are they counted in Europe region?

Because if Baltics will be together with Russians, my hype will a bit diminish. Also that would mean we can't get whitelisted </TEXT>

Would like some mature people, I don't really care about skill level, but I'd like to rank up so you should be able at least hold their own in DMG rank, n stuff.

Shortly about me: 19 years old, been playing GO for years now and accumulated over 6k hours. Reached Global couple years ago, but over time my skills got rusty and since I failed to get level 10 on faceit, decided to chill and get back to MM for another road to Global.  I can be bit of an ass sometimes, with my jokes but overall I think I'm pretty chill person outside :^ </TEXT>
