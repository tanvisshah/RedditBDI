<TEXT> This is the reason I hate trileptal. I had an IUD but my body wasn’t responding well so I had to switch to the pill. Luckily my psychiatrist told me about the interaction so I’ve been extra careful but I wish trileptal was different!! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel the same. Quite honestly I’m in the same boat as you with not really knowing how to cope. I find that taking my dogs on a walk or getting my favorite carryout food has helped a little. When I start to hate work I usually just take a break and go for a walk or a drive and listen to some music. Other than that, I’m looking for more coping mechanisms so I will certainly be in the comments with you. As always I’m here to chat if you ever need <3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> First, I just want to tell you that we see you and hear you. Even though I don’t know you my messages are open and I’m here if you need it. Second, I’m not sure how old you are, if you’re over 18 you can see a psychiatrist by yourself. If not, I would suggest finding the phone number of a psychiatrist/other professional help and bringing that directly to your parents. That way they don’t have to do much other than just call and show up to the appointment. I’m so sorry that they aren’t helping you much and if I could go to the appointment with you I would. <3 </TEXT>

<TITLE> Spotting on IUD? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-07-21 00:21:23 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi friends! So about 10 months ago I got the Kyleena IUD. All was fine and good for the first few months, then about 5 months in I randomly started getting periods and spotting. This has continued and has been a daily occurrence for 5 months now. I wouldn’t be concerned if this were occurring in the first few months but it seems strange, so I went to see my gyno. She tried putting me on a low dose of the pill with the IUD to cut some bleeding, which made no difference. She checked to make sure it’s in place and it is, and I have no STIs/STDs. Basically I’m not sure why this spotting started. Has anyone experienced this same side effect? If so, what did you do?

Side note: I’m going to get a sonogram in a couple days to see if there could be an exterior issue. Your help is greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m in the same situation. My boyfriend sleeps until early afternoon and then plays video games basically until I fall asleep... It really sucks because we barely text or call!! I can’t tell if it’s the distance or lack of communication or stress or depression that’s making me second guess everything. But just know you are not alone in your situation. I hope everything works out okay for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Female here and I’ve been in this situation... was dating a guy for 2 years and fell in love with my best friend during the relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend to date my best friend. We’ve been dating for nearly 2 years and it is definitely a different relationship but an awesome relationship. I would warn you though- if your friendship with her is more important than a relationship I wouldn’t act upon it. Your entire relationship with her will change if/when you tell her how you feel and it will never be the same. I would just say to really think about it for a while! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Super low libido...why? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-04-20 21:23:56 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So for context, I am 19F. About 2 years ago I started taking birth control and an SSRI and my sex drive tanked. The SSRI ended up not working for me so I switched to a mood stabilizer, but my libido was still completely gone. Then I realized I didn’t want to my with my boyfriend at the time, and figured that was the problem. However when I got a NEW boyfriend the problem still wasn’t fixed!! Finally I got an IUD thinking that was the only problem and alas here I am 2 years later with barely any sex drive. I know there is a multitude of potential problems, so... does anyone have experience with mood stabilizers or IUDs ruining their libido? I also have an anxiety disorder... Ugh it’s so annoying I just want to have sex again! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I usually don’t try to get shitty with suicidal people but you seem like the type that needs it. Listen here and listen closely. Don’t fucking do it. You are 19. Reread this post 100 times. Rant as much as you need. Cry all night if you need to. You’re being irrational and you need to take a step back and realize that. Listen to yourself. Stop being a hopeless romantic for tonight. You don’t know if you’ll love somebody tomorrow if you’re dead. May I remind you that you are 19? You’re in the most hormonal and bumpy years in your life and they will end soon. You will be fine. Do not kill yourself. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Any tips for me (19F) living away from my boyfriend (20M) during quarantine? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-03-24 02:54:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Obligatory apology for formatting because I’m on mobile.

So my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years; we go to the same college and see each other daily. However, because of COVID, we had to move home. I went on a cruise over spring break (yeah I shouldn’t have, but to be fair, things didn’t blow up in the US until we were already out of the country) so I have been under self isolation for the past 2 weeks. Now my state is under a shelter in place order, which goes on for the next 30 days. I’ve never gone this long without seeing my boyfriend, so I’m asking you beautiful reddit users to give us some tips! How do we stay connected and make the best out of this situation?

I’d also like to add that I understand it’s not the end of the world and people have obviously been through worse situations. Just bored and lonely during quarantine and looking for some guidance! </TEXT>
