<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I wrote 500 words of my story today despite having had the idea months ago and  I just need to be reminded that it doesn’t need to be perfect, I doesn’t even need to be good. First drafts always suck but that’s the point of them, so you have something to build off of. I’m so stuck in the mindset that every word needs to be perfect that it’s been holding me back for so long. I don’t really know the point of this post, I guess I just needed to get it out, sorry </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for your response. I am medicated and I’m on a waiting list for counselling but who knows how long that’s going to take, especially now. It’s reassuring to hear that we aren’t alone in getting so much financial help. Sometimes I feel like if people know that, they’ll think bad of me or something. Anyway, I suppose you’re right, since I first realised I had my problems, it is a lot easier to deal with. My partner is great and actually helped me come to terms with needing proper help. I’m really glad you got out of a toxic situation, I can’t imagine what that must have been like. I really appreciate your reply, I know how nervous I was to post this in the first place so I get it and I’m really grateful. I hope you’re doing well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Me(20F) and my partner(21M) have been living together for a while and we both have anxiety and depression. The corona virus has been hard but it’s given us some time to really focus on ourselves and start feeling a bit better. But I just found out we’ve been charged an extra £700 for our electricity. We’re on universal credit and are unable to work so we can’t pay but we’re lucky that my partners mum has offered to pay it for us. I guess what I’m saying is that I feel really guilty because she’s always helping us out with money but I also feel like I can’t keep doing this anymore. If being an adult is this constantly stressful, I don’t know if I want to live anymore. Maybe it’s just a bump in the road but I’m so exhausted of dealing with this stuff, I’m so scared that I’m never going to get a chance to heal because the whole world is totally against anyone who is struggling. I want to have a decent and happy life but it feels impossible right now and I don’t know if it’s worth sticking it out. Does anyone else feel like this? With the current situation it isn’t easy to seek help and I’ve felt like this so many times before that I just don’t believe it will get better anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Can we just talk about the fact that Burt Hummel is the best character that Glee came up with? He’s the most supporting parent and is shown not to be completely perfect (e.g with not being completely happy about Kurt’s sexuality in season one) but learns and grows so much throughout the seasons. Burt is my favourite character by far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I guess she wouldn’t have been around as much but even still, Tracy is the one who convinces Robin to be at their wedding while Victoria wouldn’t marry Ted if he was friends with Robin and Stella refused to have Robin at their wedding because of their history. I think part of the reason they’re so perfect for each other is because Tracy never tried to stop Ted from being friends with Robin because she truly understood how important she is to him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don’t think we know exactly how often Robin and Tracy would have interacted but I dont think it matters because we know that Ted tells Tracy all of his stories and despite knowing their complex history, she completely understands how much Robin means to him in a way Victoria and Stella never did. She trusts him and loves him enough to ensure that one of his best friends is at their wedding because that is what would make him happy. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The real reason why Tracy is perfect for Ted... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-06-30 22:05:16 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It’s not that she plays bass, has a flail, and knows about Florian van Otterloop. It’s not that she’s just as quirky as Ted and gets on so well with his friends. It goes much deeper than that... and it is the same reason why his relationships with his other partners never worked.

Let’s be real, the two other women who could have become Mrs Mosby were Stella and Victoria. They weren’t inherently bad matches for him (in fact I think Victoria is nearly perfect for him) but the biggest difference between them and Tracy is their attitude towards Robin.

Something neither of them understood is just how important Robin is to Ted and actively tried to prevent them from being friends. No matter how many times Ted told them that she is just a friend and explained how she’s like family to him, they never accepted their friendship.

Tracy, on the other hand, not only accepted their friendship but was pivotal in keeping the whole gang together. On her wedding day, instead of banning Robin from their wedding, she is the one who actively convinced her to attend because she understands how important she is to Ted in a way no one else ever did. There’s no jealousy and no resentment, she doesn’t stand in the way of their friendship and that is ultimately the biggest factor in why Ted and Tracy are perfect for each other, because she loves him enough to deeply understand his friendship with Robin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> One that always gets me is in “When your Mother Met Me” when Tracy goes outside to talk to Max after Louis has proposed. It’s my favourite episode and I don’t know how they got us to love her so much in just 20 minutes but that scene is so heartbreaking. Even more so after we find out that she dies and Ted loses his winning lottery ticket just like Tracy lost hers. I don’t know if that made any sense </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely did in my first year, I think because when I was reading for fun, I always felt like I should be doing something more important (even though if I wasn’t reading I’d probably be watching Netflix or something). It was a guilt thing. But I’m just finishing up my second year and I’ve already read 25 books since January. It really helped with my mental health and also it’s a good stress reliever. You just have to remember that you’re allowed to do the things you enjoy as well as things for university. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just finished reading Illuminae and I absolutely adored it, one of my favourite books of the year. But I’m quite content with the ending. It wrapped things up enough that I’m not desperate to read the next one right now but left enough open for me to continue. I guess what I’m asking is, is it worth reading Gemina and Obsidio? Are they good enough for me to keep loving the series or should I just stick with Illuminae and leave it at that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, I’ve been feeling really rather great as of late, more productive and relaxed. But today it’s like someone flipped the switch. Within minutes my mood completely deteriorated. At first, I thought I was hangry (I tend to get grouchy when I’m really hungry) but even after eating I felt awful - and I’m back to feeling like everything is pointless and nothing matters. I’m exhausted but every time I close my eyes I picture myself doing bad things and I can’t make it stop. I’m really scared and I don’t know what to do. Has anyone else experience this sudden and complete fall from grace? Please help </TEXT>

<TITLE> Derealisation/Depersonalisation Help? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-01-28 20:00:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi there. For a couple of days now I’ve been feeling really disconnected from myself. I am familiar with derealisation and feeling like the world around isn’t quite real or right but something feels different about this. I’ve had a mild headache for about a week now and I feel sick even though I’m not ill or hungry. I just want to sleep, mainly because I don’t feel like myself. I’ve tried watching YouTube and engaging in stuff like that but I just feel like I’m floating above myself, watching myself do those things. I don’t really know how to explain it well, so I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense. I’ve been under a lot of stress with finishing assignments from my first semester so maybe this is my mind just nopeing out because it’s bad enough? I don’t know but does anyone have any tips on how to...ground myself, I guess. I feel completely out of whack.
Thanks, much love  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Only Ever Yours by Louise O Neil is similar. It’s about a society where women are only genetically created, not born naturally, and are brought up in schools until the age of 16. They only learn to be beautiful and skinny and aren’t allowed to read etc. When their 16 they can either become companions to males, concubines (prostitutes) or chastities (teachers). It follows a girl called frieda (uncapitalised for a reason) in her final year. All of Louise O Neil’s books are really dark and hard hitting if that’s what you’re looking for.  </TEXT>
