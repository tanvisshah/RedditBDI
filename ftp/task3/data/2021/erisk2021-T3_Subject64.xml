<TEXT> On new year's eve 2020, everyone stands around with their social bubble, eagerly watching the clock, party poppers and drinks in hand. A digital clock on the television ticks down the seconds, against an aerial view of London. 23:59, it reads. Everyone is silent in anticipation. In a few seconds, this awful year will be over, and they can all celebrate. 10 seconds left, and everyone begins to count down. 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

And then...

24:00

The world is filled with a confused and horrified silence. There is no escape. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's very paradoxical, what they show and believe is very different to what's going on underneath. Narccists NEED to feel important, respected and in control of others, because that's what all of their self worth is based on. That's why they'll tell fake stories to make themselves look better, even if they know they aren't true. They need reassurance and praise from other people. They tend to be incredibly self destructive and usually won't try to genuinely better themselves, and won't actually try to be successful unless they can achieve it through other people. </TEXT>

<TITLE> In light of the recent "mental health day" </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-10-14 19:31:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm getting so tired of constantly seeing how every week seems to be "mental health week" or every day is "mental health day" and all these post about how you should look for help if you're struggling with your mental health and how everyone cares about you, blah blah blah.

But once it all blows over and its not some token mental health themed social media holiday or whatever, the reality of it all is still with the people who are actually struggling.

THERE ISN'T ANY FUCKING HELP.

For all of the people who get dragged off of a bridge and sat in a little room at A&E for 8 hours, waiting for someone to walk in, tell you to exercise more and get more sleep, and hand you a leaflet if numbers to call if (when) you feel like that again.

For the people who hide how deep their problems really go, to avoid the threat of being dragged off and stuck in a glorified prison where you're not even allowed to use a pen, and every morning and night you have medication shoved down your face, and the only real so-called improvement is the option to sit around in a circle every day and do some meaningless activity based on the idea that if you do "happy" things, you'll suddenly be "happy".

For all the people who actually call those numbers, only to sit on hold for over an hour, and end up either hanging up or being answered by an untrained volunteer who responds only with a handful of phrases from a script like "I'm sorry you feel like that." or "That must be difficult for you." read in a blank voice, devoid of emotion, that only makes you feel more alone than ever.

For the people who desperately go to their GP when they realise that they have no other options, and either get sent away because their general practice doctor has no idea what to do, or handed a box of pills with no warning of the massive list of potential side effects. And maybe, if they're really lucky, put on the two year waiting list for therapy.

And of course, the few who got that chance, and wait the two years only to find themselves given five sessions sat in front of a narccist who's only motivation for taking this job was a self serving desire to be a "hero", to have the responsibity to fix the broken by telling them that if they don't listen to their every word, they'll be responsible for failing to recover by not trying hard enough. And, of course, if they follow every instruction and it still doesn't help, that's their fault too.

In the eyes of the healthcare system, almost everyone struggling with their mental health seems to fall into one of two categories: Not sick enough to need help, or too sick to be helped.

People with mental illnesses are reminded time and time again that nobody who claims to be trained to help knows what the fuck they are doing, or actually cares. That we're not even patients, all we are seen as is a fucking problem to society. So if you stay locked in your house, terrified of the outside world, until you eventually die one way or another, that's not their problem. You're not being disruptive, so they'll leave you as you are. Your suffering doesn't matter, only the impact it has on others.

But no, we'll go on with our mental health days and weeks, share our Facebook posts about depression, whatever makes us feel good about ourselves. But when our friend or family member is breaking down at 5 in the morning because it is physically impossible for them to keep living like this, we'll say a few words, just like the ones those call operators read from their scripts, and hope they calm down. We'll forget about them when they withdraw from their friends and family, maybe drop the occasional "how are you doing?" and hope they just respond with "I'm good, you?" because any conversation beyond that is too hard. Untrained, every day people can't be expected to be the ones responsible for caring for those suffering with mental illnesses, there should be REAL HELP.

But on this just gone mental health day, and no doubt on every mental health day or week to come, nobody, absolutely nobody, wants to talk about how completely and enormously fucked up this all is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I logged on to my island this morning to find that my brother had set up on my island when he had last used the Switch. I was annoyed at first, but with a little research I quickly found that this was how extra users were intended to play, all on the same island.

For a little background info, I have PTSD, and Animal Crossing is one of the main ways that I cope. It's supposed to be my own little space where I can just chill out and have a little control over the environment, and forget about everything else for a while. Having another player able to change things and complete all of the goals completely ruins that.

If I ask my brother to just not play the game at all, that will cause arguments that I honestly cannot deal with. PLEASE tell me there's a way for him to have his own, separate island? </TEXT>

Not all seizures are losing consciousness and shaking all over. You could have at least done some research before deciding that everyone but you is lying, and definitely before humiliating her in front of your whole family. I would suggest taking in some of the information from these comments and doing some research before you next see her.

<TEXT> I recently had to start living with family again, because I lost my flat due to my ex and thanks to my health, I can't really look after myself. It looked alright at first, it seemed like they actually cared and were making an effort to treat me with respect now that I'm an adult. Oh, how wrong I was.

I recently found out that my stepdad has been stealing money and other things from me because he knows I won't remember and won't want to argue with him, as well as blaming me for not remembering things, etc.

My mum acts like she cares and will yell at him for it (last night I had the lovely experience of hearing her scream at him something along the lines of "His brain is fucked! He doesn't know what's going on!") but if I stand up for myself in any way, I become the target instead.

Last night, he stood in my doorway yelling at me for not knowing where my card is after he borrowed it. When I panicked and told him to go away, he yelled at me for that too.

Not to mention that I'm constantly reminded of what a burden I am, and how difficult it is for them to have to deal with me being like this.

I'm so fucking miserable. I thought I'd escaped all of this, but now I'm back, and I don't have a choice or any chance of escape. I can't afford a place to live, and there's no way I could survive living on my own now. I'd completely forget to drink water or look after myself, I'd either forget to eat or not have the energy to make food. I can't even handle going outside at all thanks to a mix of my mental and physical health, and if my new medication doesn't work, I'll probably keep having seizures.

All of my family either has their own health problems and lives to deal with, or live in another country. I've lost almost all of my friends, and there's no way I could expect or trust anyone who is left to deal with me like this. I don't want to put myself in the hands of the healthcare system, they're the reason I'm like this in the first place. If I can't even see a neurologist until next year despite the fact that I'm getting worse by the day, there isn't a shred of hope that I'd have anything even vaguely resembling quality of life, and I didn't even get treated like a human being in hospital.

I remember feeling trapped like this when I was younger, and I really thought I'd never have to feel this way again. Except this time, there's no hope for the future.

Sorry for the long post, I just don't have anyone I can talk to about anything anymore. Needed to get it out somewhere, I guess. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Persistent double vision on Lacosamide/Keppra? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-10-10 15:48:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (Messed up the title, sorry, got distracted)

I was recently started on Lacosamide and Lamotrigine, to gradually replace my original medication (Keppra). Starting yesterday afternoon I began having double vision. It fluctuates in severity, but it has been there the entire time, even after sleeping. Double vision is listed as a side effect on both medications.

Is anyone else taking one or both of these medications, and experienced these side effects? Is it something that will eventually go away, or do I need to speak to my doctor? </TEXT>

Probably wasn't the safest idea, but nothing bad happened.

I've also done a ton of MDMA in the past, but it stopped working at some point. Nothing out of the ordinary with that except for the time I overdosed and literally couldn't make sense of reality. I'm pretty sure that's the kind of thing that happens when most people overdose though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, definitely don't do this. You'll probably either make them choke, or lose some fingers. The proper way is to roll them onto their side in the recovery position if possible, and wait until they stop seizing. (Or the other way around, if the seizure is particularly violent.)

Did you know that people with damage to the right side of their brain will often be completely oblivious to and even in denial of a lot of the effects? I didn't.

I actually did a small AMA about it where I described some of the more obscure effects, it didn't really take off though, and I messed up the side in the title. I'll edit with the link in a second because I'm on mobile.

It can be a lot of different things, some neurological and some mental health related. Most of the neurological causes are easily treated and non-life threatening, but it's always worth checking as soon as you can just to be sure, and so you can get the right treatment either way. I do know what it's like to have these worries though, dementia was definitely one of the top suspects for me and it was a pretty scary thought. </TEXT>

I appreciate having free healthcare because, like millions of other people, I'd probably be dead if I didn't.

I've been turned down for a lot of treatments for other things that would improve my quality of life a lot, because the NHS won't fund it.

<DATE> 2020-10-09 16:05:07 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> (Sorry, pretty long post and a bit of ranting ahead)

I'm of course aware that 10 years ago, I suffered a very severe illness, which makes up a pretty big portion of my trauma. I had to learn to do pretty much everything all over again, including walking.

However, society's response to that seemed to be to get me walking again, throw me headfirst back into the education system, and expect me to just be a normal human being. There were no other investigations into other side effects, no real support, I got maybe 3 or 4 counselling sessions, and that's it. I just about scraped through passing school. I tried and dropped out of a few courses. I tried volunteering, and ended up having to stop. I found myself totally unable to get a job.

My parents said that after my illness, I totally changed as a person, but any complaints of after effects to doctors, neurologists, anyone, just got brushed off as imaginary or a temporary part of my recovery. I was essentially labelled as lazy and unwilling to work on my recovery. Eventually, I believed it. I just believed that I needed to try harder, that I just wasn't putting enough effort into being a normal, healthy person and there wasn't anything actually wrong.

Then comes the past few months. After I, by pure chance, ended up having a CT scan after a head injury (long story in itself) I got told that I'd need an emergency MRI to look at something unrelated they found on the scan. I spent 2 months absolutely terrified while I waited for an appointment for this scan (I later found out that this got totally messed up  and there was never even an actual request made) until I ended up having a seizure (I've had epilepsy since my illness but I'm medicated for it) and didn't properly recover.

After about a week in hospital, I finally got my MRI scan. And, just like that, I got sent home with a letter with my diagnosis on it. I'm thankful it's not a brain tumour or anything really horrible like that, but now.. part of me wishes I didn't know.

I've spent 10 YEARS of my life like this. 10 YEARS expecting myself to be normal. 10. FUCKING. YEARS. Being told that I'm just lazy or making it up.

The reality is, I've been left with a large amount of scar tissue (gliosis) and loss of mass in the right side of my brain. Of course, I had to look up what all of this means, because nobody fucking told me that either.

Apparently it's normal for people with this kind of damage to live in denial that anything is wrong with them, mostly because the right side of your brain is responsible for your self awareness. I've basically adapted to living with about 3/5 of a functioning brain, because nobody fucking told me.

Of course, now that I know in total certainty what is going on, the illusion is gone. I now notice that because I can't process a lot of information from my left eye, I've learned to turn my head sightly to the side to look at things. I notice that I don't really make facial expressions aside from the ones I've learned to consciously recreate because people think I'm weird if I don't. I've learned that it's not just my hearing or not paying attention, my brain genuinely cannot process human speech sometimes. I've learned to recognise so many faults in myself that my brain just glossed over before, and I've learned that I'm not and can never be normal.

And the healthcare response? My epilepsy medication of the past 9 years got changed, and I have an appointment with a neurologist in 8 months' time.

Part of me doesn't want to know any of this and just go back to being oblivious that things are wrong. But... I guess I'm also kind of relieved that I'm not just useless at being a functioning human being, that all of the people who told me I'm just lazy and stupid and not trying are wrong, but I don't know what to do with that information now. It's kind of too late, and nobody is going to actually help me anyway. And how am I meant to trust a neurologist or any medical professional again after having them mess everything up this badly?

I don't know. I guess since I found out, I just feel like I've been living in limbo, not sure what to do next.

Edit: I should probably mention that my symptoms have been getting worse over the past couple of years, because that's what happens when you leave this kind of damage totally untreated for nearly a decade. Unless the NHS gets its act together (which probably isn't going to happen because I'm never going to be able to rejoin the workforce either way), my mostly likely outlook on life is gradually getting worse, and probably developing dementia at a young age. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The whole ordeal that lead to this is pretty long and convoluted, so I'll try to paraphrase.

Basically, I got the shit beaten out of me and ended up in A&E, where they wanted to do a CT scan on my head. They basically ended up telling me that there was no serious injury from the attack, but there was something else they needed an urgent MRI scan to look at.

The appointment managed to disappear somehow, probably because of the whole coronavirus thing, but about a week ago I had a seizure and didn't recover from it properly, so I ended up in hospital, and finally got my MRI scan. They were kind of expecting a massive brain tumour or something, so this is actually pretty good news. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just realised I messed up the side of my brain, it's on the right side, but causes problems with the left side of my body. Brains are weird.

It was caused by an infection in my brain that I had as a teenager, what I've also only just found out is that my battle with that illness involved having multiple strokes.

The main issues I have are a weakness on my left side, epilepsy, issues with my memory and attention span, spacial awareness, and some occasional problems with understanding language, and my own speech to a lesser degree.

Ones I either didn't notice until I've had them explained to me or didn't know were due to brain damage that I find pretty interesting are;

*Left side neglect- basically, I struggle to process visual information on my left side. I didn't know about this at all, and obviously I've managed to adapt to this, and I unknowingly turn my head slightly to the left when looking directly at something. I also have a habit of forgetting to move my left side at all, unless I make a conscious effort to do something. It sometimes feels like my left limbs are somewhere else, don't exist, or aren't a part of me, but I thought that was just to do with the weakness.

*Facial recognition- I learned that I have Prosopagnosia (inability to recognise people by their face) a while ago, but only just found out that its due to brain damage. I also have problems reading facial expressions, but not quite as much. I also don't really express my own emotions through facial expressions.

*Problems with creativity- I was actually an artist before my illness, but struggled with it afterwards. It turns out this is because I struggle to create completely new ideas or imagine things that don't exist. It's also in part because I tend to hyper-focus on details and struggle with the full image.

The reason I didn't recognise a lot of these issues is because my awareness of self is also impaired. I've had points where I don't notice I've been seriously injured, I've gone through periods of time where I don't get hungry at all, and I haven't felt thirsty since I was ill and have to be reminded to drink fluids.

Sorry for the long reply, I just find all of this really interesting and hope others will too. </TEXT>

Fortunately, it's not a tumour or anything really horrible like that, but I do have a lot of scar tissue and volume loss in the right side of my brain. Not sure what happens next yet, but I'm not gonna die or anything, so that's good news in my books. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is what this sub is now. If you post anything, 9/10 comments will be along the lines of "But it's GOOD! I'd buy it!" or "STOP complaining about people charging $50 for low quality beginner sketches! It's mean and they DESERVE that money!"

It's now frowned upon to use this sub for its purpose. Posting and all of that is fine, but commenting on anything with any sentiment besides claiming that the art isn't delusional is pretty much a 50/50 chance on losing 50+ karma over it and people getting really mad at you. Sometimes even threatening you. It's ridiculous. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get what you mean, and it would be awesome if everyone could sell their art for those kind of prices, but times are tough for a lot of people when it comes to money right now, including artists. A lot of us can't afford to continue practicing unless we're earning at least some money back on materials, and if we all refused to sell anything for less than $100, only the most famous and popular artists would ever sell anything.

The art world doesn't need to be elitist and built upon classism anymore, art just needs to be priced appropriately based on its skill level and actual worth to the customer. Yeah, some art isn't good enough to be sold. This included. But you don't have to be a master painter to sell your work, just good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But you wouldn't pay $200 for a coffee that someone spent 3 hours making and used $100 of ingredients for, if that coffee tastes like absolute shit. That's my point. You're going to buy a normal priced coffee that tastes better.

Making money off of art is hard. You have to find the balance between paying yourself a worthwhile wage, and pricing in a way that people are actually going to buy it. If you immediately start trying to sell your practice pieces for premium art prices, nobody is going to buy them. Every artist goes through a phase where their art sells for very little or not at all, while they build up skill and a customer base. </TEXT>

Also, lockdown itself isn't the problem here, it's how it was put in place. If they had enacted a full, vital processes only lockdown as soon as this had happened, like so many other countries, this would have been over in a few weeks and millions of lives would have been saved. But no, the government couldn't handle a small hit to their precious economy in exchange for actual human lives.

But yeah, we're pretty much fucked.

PS: It's been nearly 3 months since I got told I have an abnormality in my brain and need an MRI scan to make sure it's not something that's going to kill me. I've just been told that my scan will be later today. Wish me luck :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hospitals are a complete joke right now. The results of my Coronavirus test got back about 2 days after I was admitted, at which point I'd come into contact with countless staff (luckily it was negative), and the PPE they're provided with definitely isn't good enough.

Not to mention that they're understaffed to the point of being basically non-functional. Myself and several others on the ward have been waiting days to be seen by specialists or have tests, and for outpatients,  important tests (including screening for potential cancer) have waiting lists MONTHS long.

Best of luck to staff and other patients alike, and all of my respect to the NHS staff who continue to work through all of this, as well as the staff who can't because it simply isn't safe. I wish I could say that this will all be better soon, but I honestly don't believe it will.

<TEXT> Exactly this. Artists who overprice aren't going to sell anything. When you're starting off, sure, ask £5 for your efforts and you might get some interest and make a bit of cash while you practice. But if you ask well established, popular artist prices for beginner art, it isn't going to sell. That's not being mean, that's fact. Art is a product. Price is relative to the quality of the product you're receiving. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had pretty much the exact same thing before my surgery a couple of years ago. I think it was mostly fear of the fact that I was about to go through something irreversible, more than anything, regardless of how much I'd wanted and looked forward to it up to that point. It's completely normal for a major surgery to make you nervous.

I guess the best way to deal with it would be to remind yourself how long you've wanted this, and picture what things will be like when you can be comfortable with your chest and don't have to bind or anything. Surgery and the recovery will seem pretty scary, of course, but trust me, it all passes in what seems like no time at all, and afterwards it seems pretty insignificant compared to the big, permanent improvement in quality of life :)

I wish you the best of luck, and I hope everything goes well for you. </TEXT>

Plus, I'm kind of inclined to agree with him on that one, since none of the medications I've tried have improved my mental state significantly, and every single one has had horrible side effects. One made me totally numb and ultimately ended in me trying to kill myself, another made me extremely suicidal within a few days of starting it, and the most recent one caused paranoia and hallucinations.

Life's just shitty.

I just kind of survive and keep myself distracted for as much of the time as possible so that I don't get stuck thinking about the pain or any of the other horrible shit.

I learned earlier in the year, that even if people aren't really around a whole lot, and even though it's not really their responsibility to deal with my problems or really care all that much, losing me would cause them a lot of damage. So I guess I've just got to keep being here.

I had my first seizure in nearly a year last night, so I'm going to be out of action for a few days. I hate making my family have to look after me like this, they've got their own problems to deal with, but my whole body hurts so much that even sitting up is something I dread. Days like this are the days that make me glad I can hardly remember anything that happens. Still waiting on that "urgent" MRI I was meant to have about a month ago. I kind of find myself hoping that whatever they wanted a closer look at is something really bad and they don't catch it until its too late. Mental/physical health needs team was meant to call me back a week after my assessment too, and didn't. It just feels like I'm being brushed aside in the hopes that I'll die and stop being a drain on resources. An animal in this position would have been peacefully put to sleep 10 years ago when this all started, but because I'm a human being, they're not allowed to do that.

I gave it a good run, I really did. I entered this with the thought that I was going to exceed all expectations and do well for myself. Now I'm just tired and I want it to stop. 10 years is plenty, please don't make me do another. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I mean, I'm not necessarily "formerly" suicidal, but I'm still alive through a mix of how difficult it actually is to reliably kill yourself, the consequences of fucking it up, and the fact that there's friends and family who would be very upset. I've seen what the suicide of a close friend or family member does to people, and I don't really want to cause that.

This world is a fucking cruel and horrible place, but I'd rather take on some of that suffering myself than hand it out tenfold to the people around me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I (23M) have noticed that recently, instead of seeing lights as having a kind of glow around them, as I would think is normal, I now instead see them more as lots of sharp lines coming out of the source of light, with the lines being more distinct the brighter the light is. It's not a single, roughly vertical line like I'd see in pictures made to represent astigmatism. I've had problems with light sensitivity following a brain infection about 10 years ago, but this is fairly new.

All you need is the ability to constantly bombard your patient with toxic positivity, invalidate your patient's emotions calmly and with a smile so they can't argue, and of course, make sure that they know that if they EVER disagree with you, they're a horrible person who relies on you to fix them, and they'll never get better unless they listen to and agree with every word you say.

So, basically, if you're mentally and emotionally abusive, you'd already make a "great" therapist. </TEXT>

I noticed that phrases like these were used a lot in school, too, and the purpose of them seemed pretty much the same. Is there actually a healthy use for phrases like these, or are they inherently unhealthy? Were any of you told things like this that you found particularly harmful?

Even if you're used to gore, the specific nature of it can have an effect on you mentally, and the suicide part seems to be a pretty big deal with this. Luckily for most people, the effects of trauma are pretty short term.

Even if the cause might seem relatively small, at the very least try to talk to family or friends about it, or a helpline or support webchat if that isn't possible/you don't feel comfortable doing that. If that doesn't help, definitely contact your doctor, and if you're worried that you might actually attempt suicide or you find yourself making plans to harm yourself, call emergency services. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Statistically, detransioners make up less than 1% of people who medically transition, and the vast majority of them choose to do so because of pressure from society and family, and the threat of not being able to live a normal life because of the way society treats trans people.

A 17 year old who has been certain of the presence of a medical condition they have for years, and have had this confirmed by several psychologists is not even remotely the same as them having sex with a 50 year old.

Trust me, the transition process is not even nearly as easy as walking into a room, telling them you're trans, and getting handed some hormones and booked in for a surgery next week. There's lots of waiting, lots of talking to psychologists, and in most places you have to live at least 2 years as the gender you're transitioning to before you're even allowed hormones, and then, see positive results from those for quite a while to be considered for surgery.

Yes, they get it wrong occasionally, but doctors get a lot of other things wrong sometimes. If we didn't allow any minors to get any medical procedure that had a 1% chance of going wrong, nobody under the age of 18/21 would ever have anything done medically. Plus, detransitioners VERY rarely make it to the surgery stage before detransitioning, most don't even start taking hormones.

Not to mention that minors are only ever really considered for gender reassignment surgery under VERY extreme circumstances even in the places where it's legal. These are people who are in such extreme distress that they probably wouldn't be alive when they turn 18 or 21 otherwise. Would you rather them not receive their treatment than have the tiniest fraction of a fraction of a fraction get it wrong? </TEXT>

<TEXT> And is "adult" defined as over 18 or over 21 in those laws?

Okay, so, you've got a 17 year old who has known that they're trans for the past 5+ years of their life. She's lived as a woman for almost all of this, had hormones, never changed her mind on any of this even once. But her genitals are a massive issue for her, and have been this whole time, but as is common with gender dysphoria, once other things that bothered her have been fixed, the things that haven't been fixed seem even worse.

But, due to a law that was worded in an unintended way, and could have been changed without having any effect on its intended purpose, she can't have the surgery to fix that for another 4 years. In that time she is incredibly likely to commit suicide over the discomfort.

Is that what you want? Or is it better to make those minor changes so they're not a problem for anyone? Wouldn't it make more sense for the laws on gender reassignment surgery to be made separately, where they can be handled specifically in a way that won't cause harm? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe justified isn't the right word, but you clearly hold her "lizard brain reaction" above the "lizard brain reactions" of people who are being told that their entire existence is wrong.

The difference here is that she's a celebrity with a platform that reaches millions of people, and the people responding to her are one of those millions, and even if they try to explain to her why she's wrong, their response probably won't even be seen by her.

To a celebrity, the best and often only way to show them that their behaviour isn't acceptable is through backlash. Thousands of angry tweets is going to catch their attention far more than a couple of hundred explanations. I wouldn't agree with it under less extreme circumstances, and I don't agree with the threatening nature of some of them, but she's clearly not backing down on this one, and her use of her fame like this is massively damaging to lots of people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You seriously took "sit them down and explain" THAT literally?

There's a difference between "screaming and hating" and pointing out when someone is being outright harmful to other human beings and expecting them to see the consequences of it.

Also, I'm a little confused over how you think that she's justified in becoming more angry and hateful when people are getting angry at her, but what you DON'T see as justified is people getting angry at her loudly and aggressively spreading the idea that their very existence is wrong and harmful?

Ultimately, there is no best effect here. Teaching her where she went wrong will make no difference in her opinions, it never has. Making it known that being hateful towards a group of human beings for no reason isn't considered acceptable in modern society might have some positive effects in the long run, but currently it's not making a whole lot of difference either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, but that's what's relevant to the thread right now, and I think all of this is more than enough to prove a point.

No, they shouldn't, but the thing is, nobody but a few outliers said that they should. Yet she regularly sits down and creates tweets claiming that these are huge problems and are reasons why women should be scared of trans women, or that men are going to pretend to be women to cause harm to "real women", or whatever bollocks she feels like on that given day.

We do share the same goals- not being treated like shit by society for the way we were born. I say that as part of the B as well as the T. The problem is that some people can't handle it when someone they like is caught out being shitty to a group that they don't belong to. If it isn't directly harmful to you, you just want to pretend it didn't happen and everyone to shut up about it so that you can do that. That's a problem with you, not anyone else </TEXT>

<TEXT> If sitting down and explaining to people worked, that's what people would be doing. In fact, that's what the very first responses to JK Rowling's transphobia were for the most part. But, as human beings have a tendency to do, instead of admitting she was wrong and choosing to learn, she lashed out.

See, the thing is, it's a very well known fact in psychology that when presented with evidence or reasoning that goes against their existing opinion, human beings are far more likely to lash out and become MORE confident in their opinion than to change their minds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, we're just going to ignore her constant focus on this strawman argument she's obsessed with that trans people don't think biological sex is real, which she constantly uses to justify claiming that trans people asking for a shred of respect is a direct attack on women's rights.

We're going to ignore the fact that she threw a HUGE hissy fit over someone not using the word "women" when talking about menstruation, regardless of whether it was an important word in that context or not.

We're going to ignore that she constantly retweets shit about trans women being "dangerous" to cis women and lesbians feeling "obligated to be attracted to trans women" in the LGBT community (weirdly, despite having fuck all to do with the LGBT community herself)

Oh, let's not forget that she consistently uses trans women or characters resembling trans women (feminine men or men who cross dress) as villains in her writing, which, in the context of the rest of her views, we can definitely read into. In one of her books, she had one of her characters tell a trans woman character something along the lines of "you won't like it in prison when you're pre-op." Not only implying rape and that they deserved it, but also that they'd ENJOY being raped after surgery.


Just because a writer you like being an awful person is inconvenient to you, doesn't mean its untrue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hamsters don't do well in domestic environments full stop. Even if you give them as much space, nutritious food and enrichment as possible, chances are that they're going to find it incredibly stressful anyway, especially when nursing babies. Generally, they hate being handled since they are still essentially wild animals and have very poor eyesight, and human schedules are completely mismatched to their natural sleep patterns, so unless you're planning on only feeding and cleaning their cages out at night, you're keeping an animal in a state of constant disruption. Not to mention that it's hard to find reputable breeders, any that you get from a pet store are going to be overbred and usually inbred too.

If you want to keep rodents, go for rats, or at the very least mice. And kids should especially not be given hamsters as pets. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I've heard that a lot of people don't get along well with behavioural therapy, I didn't do very well with it either. If it was affordable to you I'd definitely suggest looking at online talking therapies, but I know the problem with cost all too well :(

Medications are an option, but they're not really supposed to be long term, and they're usually supposed to be paired with therapy. Most doctors will prescribe them on their own though (usually out of laziness, unfortunately), and in your situation, they might be the best option. Just be prepared to have to try a few different ones before you find the right fit, and make sure to do your research first, because most of them have some form of side effects. Hopefully things will improve with mental health care soon and more options will be available, but until then most peoples best option is to just make do with what there is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think OP ever said that people shouldn't be able to present their gender however they want. Just that people who have dysphoria and need to medically transition to be comfortable, and people who don't and their relationship with gender is based around gender roles or politics or something else, don't belong under the same label. We have totally different needs and experiences.

Putting two entirely different groups of people under the exact same label, and discouraging any kind of separation between those two groups as "gatekeeping" just doesn't work, and it's unhealthy for everyone involved. People aren't getting access to the correct information for what they're going through, the correct kind of support is incredibly difficult to find, and a lot of people are ending up alienated in the spaces where they're meant to feel the most safe and at home. Plus, it's confusing for anyone who doesn't have any experience with trans people and is looking to learn, and leads to a lot of trans people, and even trans rights in general, getting treated in the wrong way. </TEXT>

Also having unrealistically high expectations set for me academically from pretty much the moment I started school, being screamed at for hours over any tiny mistake I made, and being treated like absolute shit by other kids. As a teenager, getting kicked out a bunch of times and having to wander the streets or stay on people's sofas kind of added to the reality check.

But at the same time, I don't think I actually "grew up fast". I think I just learned what a horrible place the world is way too early, before I even got the chance to enjoy it obliviously.

<TEXT> I'm just about done trying with this country's mental health care system. They basically just do everything in their power to avoid spending too much time and money on you, and hope that you'll either keep on living miserably, or it won't disrupt the workforce too much when you finally kill yourself.

If you don't reach out for help, nobody notices. If you reach out for help, you're trying too hard and there's obviously nothing *really* wrong with you. Suicide attempts are totally unrecorded. If you fail, they assume you weren't really trying, and if you reach out for help after failing, as far as they're concerned, you're just faking it for attention. If you kick up enough fuss, they might shove some medication down your throat and hope you'll shut up.

In the EXTREMELY unlikely event that you ever actually get therapy, every therapist I've been in contact with is either like talking to a brick wall, or borderline emotionally abusive. They talk over you, invalidate your feelings, and get angry at you if you dare to stray even the tiniest bit from the narrative they're trying to build about you. You talk about what they want you to talk about, you are who they tell you that you are, you feel how they tell you that you feel, and if you disagree, no matter how politely and submissively, you're one of those dreaded "uncooperative patients" that they constantly tell you about who never get better.

I'm genuinely starting to wonder if anyone in this country has ever recovered from mental illness, or if they've just been trained well enough to shut up, get back in their box and pretend everything is fine. Or they just found a medication that works, so the government can just keep shovelling pills down their throats for the rest of their lives to keep them productive. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pretty much, when I tried to explain to her the things that are making me feel suicidal, she said that it's all just me being negative and I need to learn to not be negative, in pretty much those exact words. If I tried to mention something that was bothering me, she'd tell me off for being negative again.

Still better than the one who told me that not sleeping early was the cause of all of my problems and if I just go to bed early I'll be fine. She then got angry when I continued to struggle to sleep because I clearly "wasn't trying". Never mind the horrible nightmares and the anxiety whenever I'm not actively doing something, that make it nearly impossible for me to sleep at all. I don't know if I have horrible luck with CBT or it's genuinely just medicalised abuse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lost almost all of my close friends over the past year due to my abusive ex partner. Nobody talks to me anymore. I was neglected and verbally abused by my family through my entire childhood, and even now, despite their insistence that I can turn to them when my mental health gets bad, I'm consistently reminded that they don't give a single shit about me, to the point where they refused to take me to a hospital when my leg was covered in gaping wounds up to half an inch deep because it was too much hassle. Any family that actually seems to care lives either on the other side of the country or in another country entirely. Even the mental health services I've reached out to for help have brushed me off more times than I can count. And now I've just found out that my only remaining close friend might be a domestic abuser. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's not about a "big payday". The issue is that 90% of doctors will write off people who are genuinely struggling and incapable of working, because they totally underestimate levels of pain or difficulty for someone who has to live with their condition every single day, and instead judge just what they're capable .of for a few moments in the doctor's office. Plus, doctors always already assume you're exaggerating, so you end up kind of having to.

<TEXT> I seem to have a bit of a habit of close run-in with death, so this might take a while. Content warning: suicide, domestic abuse

Meningoencephalitis (did actually die a couple of times): Not a whole lot, I was unconscious for most of it and was on a lot of pain meds. The dreams were weird though.

Hypothermia: I worried about how my friends and family would feel for a while, but I'd gone up there to kill myself anyway. Kind of stopped worrying about anything towards the end, I think. Couldn't really think enough to worry.

First time my ex partner tried to kill me: Again, I don't think a whole lot really crossed my mind, just adrenaline. When you've got someone choking you and screaming at you that they're going to kill you, you don't have a lot of time for deep or meaningful thoughts.

Overdose on MDMA: I honestly couldn't make any sense of anything. The world around me, time, nothing made sense. All I knew was that something was horribly wrong and I was scared. Lots of confusion over why my ex partner, who was right next to me, wasn't listening when I said that something was wrong. I could see marks on the walls standing out and moving around. I guess I must have eventually passed out.

Suffocation: I guess I was thinking a lot about what would happen after I'm gone, how my family would cope, things like that. Also a lot about the horrible person that my ex partner had painted me to be and how all of my friends now hated me. Then total fear and panic when there actually stopped being air to breathe. No matter how much you actually don't want to be here anymore, everything in your body will always tell you to fight for air.

Second time my ex partner tried to kill me: At first, trying to get myself as far away as quickly as possible, and then eventually realisation kind of set in and I realised that I was probably going to die alone in the street. Also thought a lot about how I could finally see my ex for the terrible person they were. Again, concussion and adrenaline doesn't give a whole lot of room for deep thought. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dude, why are you so obsessed with crawling up the Devs' asses? I've seen so much more progress in less time by teams of the same size.

For example, Subnautica was fully released in barely more time than this game has been in development, by a development team of roughly the same size, and it has at least as much content as we were promised with Saurian, if not more.

The updates are painfully slow, but that's not even the point. It's the amount of content in those updates. Retexturing a plant takes a couple of hours at most, and if it takes them several months to release a couple of plant retextures and a minor tweak to AI, they're clearly not spending very much of that time actually working on the game.

We all wanted this awesome, realistic dinosaur game that we were promised, that's why we're disappointed. But we're clearly not getting it, and people are annoyed, because this isn't a cheap game. </TEXT>

And if you call someone out in a public place like on social media, you're probably going to be on the receiving end of harassment and overall just labelled as a horrible person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really depends where you are, unfortunately some places laws and policies give you less of a time frame than others.

The best way around this is to get in contact with an organisation that exists to help victims. They offer the answers to these kinds of questions, personal support, and most will actually help you through the whole process if you do choose to go through with it, or at least get you in contact with someone who can.

I've had one of those organisations helping me out with getting a restraining order against an ex partner, and it's made everything so much easier than it would have been otherwise. Personally I chose not to press charges because I know it wouldn't be safe for me, but thanks to them, everything is on his record for the future. </TEXT>

If you do feel like you should report it, it's perfectly fine to give yourself time to recover until you feel more capable of going through with it.

<TEXT> I found that the best way I got through something similar is to stop blaming myself. It takes time and it isn't easy, but it can be done.

Someone else's choice to exploit you wasn't your fault. They made that choice, and you couldn't have known what to do in that situation. What happened to you was horrible, but no part of the blame is on you. It doesn't make you any lesser. The only one who is lesser is the person who made the decision to harm you.

If you can find someone who you trust enough, talk to them about it, they should understand and tell you the same. Find a professional if you feel like you can't talk to anyone close to you and that feels like a safer option. Don't rush to do that though, you only need to do it when you feel ready. </TEXT>

<TEXT> (on Huawei Y7)

I keep receiving notifications that I have a new voicemail message, but with no notification of a missed call. I also don't seem to be receiving any voicemail messages that I can access when this happens. (I can't access Huawei's own voicemail service for some reason, but I've tested this and voicemail messages usually go to my Giffgaff voicemail inbox just fine.) I've had people call me and let it go to voicemail, and I've been unable to replicate this on purpose. I do have a few numbers blocked, if that is relevant.

I've already been through my settings and made sure that all of the appropriate permissions are enabled like the website and similar threads suggested, but everything was already enabled, and as said previously, this doesn't happen if I get someone to call me and leave a voicemail. </TEXT>

Lots of people I used to trust have totally broken that trust recently, so I don't want anything to do with them. Others I just feel like are getting tired of hearing about how I feel and just brush me off, so I don't want to keep bothering them with it. After all, I'm not their problem to worry about I guess. It just seems like the few people still in my life want me to be there to listen to their problems and help them, but if I try to reach out to them, they're just condescending to me and don't care at all.

I'm not sure if I could explain what's going on anyway, I don't know how and when I've tried, people either don't care or don't seem to believe me. I just want to be away from all of the drama and away from being used, but at the same time, being completely alone is becoming horrible. I don't really interact with anyone anymore, not even through messages. I'm really not sure what to do or where to go from here. </TEXT>

For one, back in the late 2000s/early 2010s, when I was a young artist just getting started with commissions and everything, the furry art community was overwhelmingly toxic. Back then I did a lot of art of fantasy creatures, so naturally, there was some crossover in audience with furry artists. The amount of art theft (tracing of other people's art, colouring over other people's art, very obviously copying it line for line, even just reposting it- all without permission or credit, and often making money off of it), drama, harassment, and tantrums over perfectly reasonable commission prices coming from the furry community was absolutely unreal. I ended up quitting pretty much all of the art sites I used because of it.

Then there's the amount of time that I spent with a small group that investigated online shit in our free time (if anyone has seen Don't Fuck With Cats, that kind of thing) and the shit I have seen from the furry community is unbelievable. Anyone remember "Wolfie Blackheart", the kid that beheaded their neighbour's dog? What about the whole thing with the Tumblr furry community and all of the animal rape/sexual abuse blogs, particularly involving dogs? Not to mention the pedophilia, rampant sexual harassment and the sheer amount of bullying to the point of suicide, especially over art.

Not all furries are bad, and there are a lot who stay well away from all of this crap, but nobody can possibly deny that furries have been one of the most toxic, damaging fandoms in the history of the Internet. There is a reason that the whole thing of people disliking furries started. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The nurse who told me that my leg was hurting because I wasn't walking on it enough.

I had septicemia, nearly lost my leg from the knee down.

I still get the "just get more exercise!" thing, even though about 6 years of my normal level of walking around without aid has left me with a fucked up hip from compensating for my knee, back problems for a similar reason, and I'm looking at needing a knee replacement in the next 5 or so years at most. More exercise isn't going to help.

And don't even get me started on the memory problems. Just writing things down isn't going to work when most of what you just told me didn't even enter my short term memory. I don't write down every single conversation I have. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The problem with sleeping pills is that a lot of them can make you feel pretty unwell if you don't end up falling asleep after taking them, which can be a pretty big issue with anxiety related sleep issues. I'd say try them in combination with something like reading or listening to relaxing music before bed, and definitely only take it about 10 minutes to half an hour before you plan to sleep. Don't be scared to ask your doctor to try a different medication if that one doesn't work out for you. Also, you'll usually have your dose gradually reduced and then stopped once you start developing a healthy sleeping pattern again, so addiction shouldn't be a problem.

It's no trouble at all, I've been in a similar position to this before, and it can get pretty worrying and confusing. I really hope the meds work for you and you can get some decent sleep 🙂 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to keep myself at least somewhat distracted until I'm either tired enough that I know I'll fall straight to sleep, or I actually fall asleep (usually when watching something.) If I'm not distracted I think too much, and I really can't handle silence, especially at night.

As a probably healthier and more effective version of that, perhaps try something like reading before bed? It'll help you keep calm and distracted until you're tired enough to drop off. Calming music might also help.

As for the brain damage thing, noticeable, irreperable damage would only happen after prolonged poor sleep over the course of months or years (depending on how much), or staying completely awake for days on end, which your body usually won't allow you to do. There's no need to worry about that. If it continues to be a problem and you're worried, going to a doctor is always an option. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Telling someone that they should kill themselves is incredibly, intensely abusive. Normal people don't say things like that during arguments. I know it can be hard with kids involved, but you don't deserve to have to go through that. Marriage (and personal counselling too) are a good first option, but I really recommend starting to think about options for getting yourself and the kids away from her if that fails or it gets worse. Abusive people unfortunately don't often change for the better, especially when nothing changes because of their behaviour. Abuse also often gets worse the longer it goes on.

I'm really glad you're still alive, you're incredibly strong for staying with us, but you really don't deserve to be made to feel like suicide is your only option. Nobody has the right to make you feel that way. You deserve to be happy and alive just as much as anyone else does. </TEXT>

Also, talking therapy is a thing. Mental health treatment isn't just medication. This has been the case for decades. Environmental factors are very well recognised as joint or sole causes of certain mental illnesses. It's just recognised that there are genetic and physical factors as well.

Just my two cents. Feels kind of like you guys are fighting a great big strawman here.

<TEXT> I've recognised recently that I often completely fail to recognise that something is dangerous. For instance, as a common example, it's become pretty regular for me to touch things that have just come out of the oven, or even attempt to take something out of the oven with my bare hands.

Usually in cases like this, I fortunately realise very quickly after hurting myself and let go of the object, but there are times when it's taken me a few moments to realise I'm being burned.

This pattern has also run over into other injuries, such as not realising that deep wounds were serious until someone got worried, or even continuing normally with my day with serious burns.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is a very complicated issue, but like I said in my original response, I think it's being made a large portion more complicated by insisting that we all be put under the exact same label. People who experience gender dysphoria and people who don't conform to gender roles do have vastly different experiences and needs, and refusing to allow people to make that distinction limits the effectiveness of support and resources everyone is receiving.

Of course some shared experiences will interact and there will be some people who overlap between the two, but making it a bad thing for people to distinguish what kind of support they're looking for is massively harmful. </TEXT>

Personally, I do agree that my experience helped shape who I am. I dislike my scars sometimes and I'd be lying if I said there weren't times I didn't wish I'd have them, but I don't know if I'd actually get rid of them given the chance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I grew back some of the cartilage in my knee by myself when that isn't supposed to be possible, unfortunately the missing bits of kneecap didn't grow back. I've also definitely gone more than a few days without water. I never get thirsty.

Survived bacterial meningoencaphalitis, which caused at least 3 strokes. I flatlined a couple of times (one for over five minutes), but obviously came back. No doubt I've got pretty significant neurological damage, but I was meant to be either dead, brain dead, or deaf and blind.

That and a few other incidents have me convinced that I just can't die.

Do you have any theories over why these things are happening to you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gender at its core is based on biological sex, everything else (expected behaviour, clothes, names, etc.) is socially constructed. So surely if dysphoria doesn't have anything to do with your body, specifically your primary and secondary sexual traits, wouldnt that mean that it's a result of society and is something that you develop and can be changed, rather than being biological and innate?

Also, nobody said you have to hate your body. Discomfort towards the traits you feel are incorrect and a desire to change them =/= self hatred. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really do wish those kinds of people would understand the harm that they're doing by demanding access to ALL of our spaces, and then taking over said spaces with their specific narratives.

Young and newly aware trans people who are struggling with dysphoria and need to transition to feel comfortable need a kind of support that isn't available in these circles, and is even outright labelled as transphobia by some of these people and can get you kicked out of groups. But we're not allowed our own spaces to share or seek that kind of information and support in because that's "exclusionary". There is a difference in both experiences and needs between people who have dysphoria and people who don't, and pointing that out isn't discrimination, it's fact. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I (23M) can taste everything else just fine, but my ability to taste heat from things like hot peppers is almost completely gone. I've never really had a high tolerance for spicy food, moderate heat is usually a bit much for me.

But the other day, a family member made guacamole with a whole red chilli in it, and even family members who are big fans of hot foods commented on how hot it was, but I got a light tingle from it at best. I've since tried it out on other hot foods, and had the same results. Everything else tastes perfectly normal.

It might be worth noting that I'm due an MRI scan for a brain abnormality spotted on something else, but it doesn't seem to be particularly urgent and I don't have any real details. I don't have any other issues with my senses of smell or taste. </TEXT>

When I do, I do it obsessively. Everything I has to be perfect, disinfected, everything has its place. Probably a result of years of being screamed at for every mark or object out of place, even when it wasn't my fault.

Also, even though I got yelled at constantly for not cleaning or doing other household chores, I was never taught how. Everything I know how to do, I taught myself. I didn't even know you were meant to clean certain things, still not really sure how often normal people clean everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Genetics is a bit more complicated than the simple recessive/dominant model that most people are taught in school. A lot of genes are masked by other genes, don't present because of environmental factors, or have more variants than just on/off.

For instance, SMA, the illness that runs in my family, has 3 variants, all caused by mutations of the SMN1 gene. However, variations on another gene, SMN2, determine the severity of the disease and the age it presents itself. With healthy SMN2 genes, you may not even notice difficulties until into old age, even with both SMN1 genes damaged. However without healthy SMN2 genes, it can be a deadly childhood disease. </TEXT>

The recessive/dominant model that you're shown when you get taught about genetics in school is overly simplified, most inherited diseases are influenced by a combination of different genetic factors. The risk was at its peak with OP, but it's going to take a generation or two to totally return to normal.

Edit: The illness that runs in my family, SMA, is actually a good example of things being more complicated than the simple recessive/dominant, on/off model of genetics taught in schools. It has 3 variants, all caused primarily by mutations of the SMN1 gene. However, variations on another gene, SMN2, determine the severity of the disease and the age it presents itself. </TEXT>

In fact, the more research that is done into mental illness, the more unreliable it looks.

<TEXT> Got this a lot when I was younger over the tiniest things. Hopefully it'll calm down and go back to normal, but my biggest piece of advice is that getting out of there as quickly as possible is definitely in your best interests, because it tends to keep happening. Once you're independent and they don't have this kind of power over you, things tend to ease up a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not exactly relevant to its price, but this definitely didn't take more than 30-45 minutes, even for a beginner. Just saying.

And although effort does factor into reasonable pricing of art, demand is the main factor. I could spend 4 hours creating some art that I might expect to sell for $30-40, but a more experienced and well known artist might sell work they spent the same amount of time on for over $100. When you're selling art, it's a product, and for any product to sell, there has to be people willing to buy it for that price. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a few contenders, but I think it's got to be the time I got my leg locked straight. Doesn't sound serious, but I have septic arthritis, so I have next to no cartilage in that knee, and at the time, the mescle/tendon that runs down the outer side of my knee was too tight to actually allow my leg to straighten naturally. So my knee was literally just bare bone being ground together by my muscles.

I spent 6 hours in hospital in total agony, and they had to give me a ton of morphine before forcing it to bend again. I later had a surgery to release the muscle where it attaches to my knee. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do also have general weakness on that side because of brain issues, but I've had surgeries to fix some of the physical damage. I've been walking without aid for about 2 years now, there's a bit of pain and I can't go too far, but it's manageable. I've been told I'll need a knee replacement eventually, but I'd like to leave that as long as possible.

I don't know if I can pick a favourite, Eragon is obviously going to hold a special place in my heart as the start of it all, and I've read it and Eldest 3 times (reread when both Brisingr and Inheritance came out) but if I had to pick one, I guess it would have to be Brisingr for just how rich in story and character development it is.

What movie? (lol, most people I've spoken to about it like to retend it doesn't exist). Yeah, definitely not a fan of the movie, there's just so much of the story missing from it, and the acting is horrible. Also pretty annoyed by how they tried to make an ending for it because the rest of the books weren't out yet.

I would really love to see a series or something based on the books, I think that's pretty much my dream show. Proper traditional fantasy is really something we need to see more of at the moment, and I just know they could do so much better with the series than that train wreck of a movie. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a bit of lasting damage, but I get by mostly normally. I had septicemia as a complication and nearly lost my left arm and leg, luckily both were saved, with a bit of damage to my knee joint. The neurological problems are a bit more complicated, and even now I'm still learning the actual extent of them. I worked for a while a year or two ago, but ended up struggling too much with it.

I don't actually remember most of the events leading up to it, so what I have to say about it might be a bit inaccurate, since I can oy go by piecing together what I've been told. I was initially taken into hospital because I had a massively high temperature and was vomiting uncontrollably whenever I was given food or liquids, and I was diagnosed with gastroenteritis, a stomach bug. Later I developed head pain and light sensitivity as well as pain in my left leg, which pretty much got ignored by nurses and written off as me overreacting. It wasn't until I became comatose overnight and started having seizures that I was rushed in for an MRI scan and diagnosed correctly.

The recovery process was definitely difficult. When I first properly came around, I was told that I couldn't walk. I remember there being lots of different tests, I think the next few months were just eye tests, hearing tests, blood tests, cognitive tests, just everything to figure out what damage had been done. Physiotherapy was horrible, but completely necessary. Took a while and a few surgeries for it to work, I was in a wheelchair for 2 years. I was a teenager, so I missed a lot of school, but somehow managed to pass everything important.

My favourite colour is definitely red. Has been for as long as I can remember, lol.

Both are good, but pink lemonade is just slightly better. I like raspberry.

Reading and music were actually a pretty big thing for me when I still couldn't go out much, so I can probably think of a few recommendations. Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle are great books, Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams are pretty well known books but definitely underrated. There's a band I like called White Rose Movement that only ever made two albums, only one of which had an official release, but I just think they made a variety of really interesting sounding stuff, and I wish they'd made more. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually dying tends to do it. I've been clinically dead 3 times. Two of those were just nothing, like total darkness without the darkness. All of the pain, noise, stress, chaos, just... gone. The worst part was probably coming back. Reality hits you like a ton of bricks compared to that total peace.

What I think was the longest one (about 5 minutes) I did see something. It wasn't religious in any way, just being taken through the hospital and out onto the street by my mum and a nurse, and wandering off into the snow. At one point, I sat down to watch a TV that was on top of a car (weird, I know, I can't remember what was actually on the TV) and then the nurse telling me it was time to go back. Then I was awake.

What I saw was probably the weird final processes of my brain shutting down, especially since what I died of was a brain infection, but neither option seems particularly bad or scary. Just peaceful.

I'm actually waiting on further scans to investigate an abnormality spotted on a brain scan I had after a head injury (injury wasn't serious). I'm far more scared of all of the medical procedures and potential suffering than the idea of it being something that might be fatal, to be honest. </TEXT>

It's essentially when your brain confuses things a bit and starts dreaming before you actually fall asleep. If it's making it difficult for you to sleep it might be worth mentioning to your doctor, but if going to bed is the only time it happens, it's probably not related to anything serious. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what it is, I just can't stay in one place for too long. No matter where I go, after all a short while I just feel this overwhelming need to be somewhere else. I've moved house several times this year, as well as staying with family and friends a lot, because no matter where I go, it's only a matter of time until I just can't handle being there anymore. Sometimes just staying away for a few days works, but often it needs to be more permanent. I don't know how to stay settled anywhere or why I feel like this everywhere I go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fortunately it wasn't a big overdose because my ex was totally unwilling to seek medical attention for me, but I've overdosed on MDMA. It's absolutely horrible. I couldn't comprehend anything that was going on around me, things on the walls looked like they were moving around or standing out, and I just had this overwhelming feeling of uter dread. I was shaking and twitching uncontrollably the whole time. I legitimately believed that I was going to die, and I think I eventually passed out.

<TEXT> Aside from complete lack of enjoyment of anything, and no desire for anything or to do anything, and most of the time just feel totally emotionally numb, which is a problem that's kind of just developed over the past few months, my family has been pulling me up about a lot of "weird" behaviour. Like sitting really still and just zoning out for really long periods of time, struggling with any level of stress to the point where I start doing things like excessive pacing, rocking back and forth, and a weird tapping thing I do (hard to describe, I have a specific pattern I tap out on my leg and I rarely notice when I start, but it can be very difficult to stop. If I mess it up I end up hitting myself, which is next to impossible to prevent myself from doing, it feels automatic but still feels kind of like I might be doing it on purpose? Or at least maybe I started on purpose and it just became habit). I notice when I'm doing these things, but that doesn't mean I can just stop, if I try, I'll usually just start again.

I've also had a few incidents that I convinced myself were a really big deal at the time, but not I'm starting to feel like I made it seem worse than it was, or I'm just straight up imagining it. It kind of started off as unusually "loud" thoughts that weren't in my internal voice, if that makes sense, but from what I remember of the last few times, they were pretty hard to distinguish from actual sounds. Usually just random words and phrases, sometimes sound effects like whistling or screaming, nothing worrying like commands or anything. I don't really want to start a whole panic if it's just something I'm causing by listening out for it.

I do have a history of self harm, which I will admit is getting pretty severe and I've needed serious medical intervention the last couple of times, but the thing I'll actually agree is concerning is that I usually don't realise its serious until either someone finds out and gets worried, or quite a while after. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Probably having no escape from all of the screaming arguments whenever I did the tiniest thing wrong, or sometimes just out of the blue for burdening them by being ill. If I went to my room, they'd stand outside my door and scream at me and hit/kick the door until I unlocked it. If I asked them to leave me alone, it would only make things worse. If I argued back, it made it much worse. If I tried to leave, they'd get in the car and follow me. For a good portion of this, I was unable to walk or even stand on my own, so leaving wasn't even an option.

The things they said, the threats, and even the instances of physical violence were bad. But it was knowing that I couldn't escape that made it as damaging as it was. </TEXT>

They said it was unusual though that I show traits for multiple types. The things they talked with me about are practically torture coming from my own brain. Food issues, intrusive thoughts, I even have periods of time that I become overly aware of things like my own breathing and swallowing and I spend sometimes spend weeks of my life begging for it to stop, even though it just sounds stupid to everyone else. I didn't know that it had such high comorbitity with PTSD though.

Eventually I just learned that I'm meant to keep them all to myself as much as possible, especially because if I got angry at being literally screamed at and threatened, I was the "bad guy" and I was the one causing all the problems, and crying was pathetic and would only get me mocked and shouted at.

As an adult, I physically cannot cry except for under very specific circumstances. I couldn't even cry when my grandad died. I also went through an abusive relationship feeling that defending myself in any way was the worst thing I could possibly do, so I just didn't, even when getting brutally beaten. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having empathy for healthcare workers doesn't mean excusing them treating their patients badly. Yes, it's a high stress job. No, that doesn't mean they get to take it out on patients who rely on their care and can be very negatively impacted by that kind of treatment. If they can't handle their work without treating the people who rely on them in ways that might actually make their conditions worse, they shouldn't be doing the job. Nobody is forcing them to stay in that line of work if it isn't right for them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That doesn't mean that the low standard of care is okay. If you went back a few hundred years to someone having that same horrible care, would you tell them they should be thankful that they're getting any at all?

It's honestly a disgrace that mental health care is so overlooked and far behind in comparison to all other health care, to the point where being rude and cruel to patients who could be deeply damaged by that kind of behaviour is brushed off as "but they're under stress!"

The attitude that the quality of mental health care doesn't matter as much or "isn't as bad as it used to be" is certainly what is keeping us so far behind. </TEXT>

This has caused my a few health problems through my life, so I kind of suspected it would probably make a difference with this. I was in a relationship at the time when I was set to find out, but we split up a couple of days before the actual appointment where I got told I can't have kids, which means I ended up going on my own. Kind of learned to accept it over time, especially after seeing a few of my friends ruin their lives by getting toxic partners pregnant or trying to fix their fucked up relationships with a kid, but it was difficult for a while. </TEXT>

Playing games or doing pretty much anything I used to enjoy is exhausting. Watching things is exhausting. Fuck, half the time, just existing is exhausting.

I have to keep myself constantly distracted though, or things get weird in some pretty horrible ways. So I spend most my life playing stupid, mindless mobile games that I actually kind of hate, or staring at some random show that's on for background noise and doesn't really hold any interest for me. I genuinely don't find any enjoyment anything anymore, so it just feels pointless to spend the energy doing things.

I've been in some pretty dark places, but I really think that this is getting close to the very end of what a person can handle. I don't even have any motivation to end it, nor could I do that to the people in my life. I just kind of lay around, hoping it's going to be over soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The main point that I really want to make in this whole debate is that removing the platform for bigoted people to communicate with each other doesn't make those people go away. It actually causes them to spread into other communities and spend more time harassing other people. Banning their communities also feeds into their "us" vs "them" complexes, and gives them more ammunition to claim that they are being victimized, which they usually use to help them recruit new people into their viewpoints. In my opinion, the best way to deal with these kinds of subreddits is to keep a close eye on them and make sure that they aren't being used to promote or plan any hate crimes or harassment, minimise their ability to advertise themselves, and otherwise just leave them to it. </TEXT>

(Since nobody ever has any clue what that is, and I didn't at first either, it's essentially meningitis, infection and swelling of your brain lining (meninges), and encephalitis, infection and swelling of your brain tissue, all at the same time.) It got caught really late because for a while because doctors kept insisting that I just had a stomach bug, and eventually my mum found me unconscious when turning up to visit one morning, and it seemed like I'd probably been like that most of the night without being checked on. I spent a few weeks in a natural and then medically induced coma, medically died 3 times (each time from a stroke), and my family were told that I would at the very least lose my left arm and leg from above the elbow and knee, and I would most likely be deaf and blind if I ever regained consciousness or even survived. I survived with some relatively minor brain damage, and kept all of my limbs thanks to an emergency on-ward operation.

I've had a few others since then, but they all involve either suicide attempts or extreme domestic violence, so I don't think they're the best to share in this kind of thread. </TEXT>

And I spend the day digging myself out.

But when I lay exhausted in bed at night,

I wonder.

<TEXT> Me, my two closest friends, and one of those friends' girlfriend were having a bit of a party. Drugs kind of helped me gain the confidence to approach one of my best friends (the single one) when we were alone for a while and tell him that I'd had feelings for him for a while. Turns out he felt the same, and we ended up sleeping together.

Turns out he was having a lot of issues with his ex, who was pregnant at the time, and was trying to stop him from seeing his kid. He ended up living with me for a while, we continued having lots of amazing sex, but didn't want to make it official to avoid causing more shit with her. This went on for about 4 months. Eventually it all kind of settled, we ended up making it official a few days before the new year, at which point she started begging him to come back, and responded with an onslaught of abuse and homophobic slurs through messages when he refused, then tried to get him arrested for responding.

A month or so in, he started becoming verbally abusive, and then finally physically attacked me after a concert after a minor disagreement (wasn't even an argument). Apparently that mental block I have prevents me from hitting someone I'm with back, even when my life is at risk, because our other friend had to drag him off of me. My injuries left me trapped at his place in another city when lockdown happened, during which time his ex lost the baby. He proceeded to become more verbally abusive, until eventually we split a couple of months back. His side of the reasoning was that I wasn't properly seeking help for my mental health and it was affecting him, and the idea was to sort our issues out then try again. Unfortunately I am weak to good ass, and we continued sleeping together up until the point where he invited his ex over to a party, locked himself in his room with her the whole time got pissed off when I raised doubts about his honesty about his intentions, and physically attacked me again. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of moving into the same shared house as him the day before, and ended up kind of stuck there. He attacked me once more since, and is now back with that ex. I now know that their relationship was mutually abusive, and honestly, they kind of deserve each other. I am staying with my parents until I can find somewhere else to live. Oh, and my friends sided with him in the end. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm out of the pit I was in before, learned to hate my ex for how they treated me and that helped me get over it all a bit. But I've still got the biggest issue in my life going on, the one that's making it difficult to want to put the effort in to get "better".

I don't enjoy anything anymore. Not a thing. Don't find enjoyment in doing anything I used to like doing, or anything new I've tried. I don't even enjoy food anymore, there's just food I dislike and food I don't dislike. It goes so far that I don't even feel a sense of achievement when I complete a task, even something really difficult, it's just kind of... "well, at least I don't have to worry about that anymore", I guess.

The world just feels grey, and dull, and pointless. I've taken to spending most days just laying around smoking and staring at whatever random shit is on TV. Nothing really feels worth the energy unless I'm going to suffer if I don't do it. I've been depressed for a long time, but this is a whole new low. Nobody I've tried explaining it to gets it. I just don't feel anything about anything unless it's negative. I honestly don't see the point in continuing to exist like this, but I don't want to put everyone through the whole deal of losing me, and I'd probably just fuck it up again anyway. Guess this is just how things are now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Our brain. The whole thing. It's such a fragile and yet important piece of biology. So much can go wrong, but they control every part of us. Our organs doing what they're meant to, the way we behave, whether or not we seek out food and water or even breathe. The tiniest little bit of damage or the wrong environmental factors, even every last thing about how we develop controls whether it does those things right or not. You don't seem to see many other animals that are capable of having just as much wrong with their brains as we can. Maybe we just evolved to the point that our brains are far too complex and fragile. Maybe that's the great filter that's keeping intelligent life from popping up everywhere. If we get too smart, it becomes too much for biology to reliably sustain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Life doesn't have a meaning. We all exist through a series of massively unlikely events that just happened to come together and result in where we are today. The only reason the massive unlikelihood of that happening seems so weird and impossible is that if it hadn't happened, you wouldn't be here to think that.

Maybe some people will tell you that the meaning of life is the meaning you give it, but I think that's bullshit. If you try to make a meaning for your life, some kind of goal, you're either going to reach that goal, and have to live the rest of your life without meaning, or you're never going to reach that goal, and your life won't have had meaning. In the end, all we can really do is fill our life with whatever makes it seem worth it, and then one day, we're done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm confused, and I'm alone, and I'm scared. I just need to find someone, anyone to talk to who doesn't exist on the other side of this glass wall that I feel like I live my life on the other side of. The mental health teams don't help, because there's always this part of my head that tells me I can't trust them. No matter how many times I rehearse what I need to say to them and how to explain what is going on, something stops me. I lie to them and make them think I'm at least somewhat okay. My friends have already given up on me, gotten mad at me and left. My family are trying, but I don't know if I can ever reform that trust with them after everything, something just tells me that as soon as I put too much trust in them, they'll turn around and the facade will fall and everything will just be the same again. Sometimes I come out of this haze and confusion and start trying to make sense of things, but then it just drags me back down and everything's just confusing and distant. Sometimes I can go for what seems a couple of days only to be told that weeks have passed, and it hits me like a ton of bricks, but then soon enough it doesn't mean anything. I don't even know how long this has been going on, I couldn't even make a guess. Weeks? Months? Everything just all seems so distant and yet so close together at the same time. I don't even know who the fuck I am anymore as a person, or if that even matters right now. All I know is that nobody around me can help me out of this. Nobody can stop everything from spinning out of control again and me suddenly finding myself not knowing what to do or what's going on or how things got like this. I just want it to stop. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on the method. Illness is strange and confusing, if you're unconscious, your brain pieces together random bits you've seen or heard recently. There's a kind of calmness, but also this deep, unshakeable sense of dread when things start to shut down. Being dead is just... blackness, but without the black, and cold, but without the cold. There's just... nothing. I don't think you can explain it to someone who hasn't experienced it.

Hypothermia... its horrible at first. Incredibly painful, you never think that you could possibly feel that cold and your skin hurts and all of your extremities hurt. But then you stop shivering, and you stop feeling cold. It stops hurting, and everything around you just feels unreal, like you're in a dream. It's like you're on the inside and everything outside is just a picture. And all you want, more than anything else, is to just sleep. You're glad that you're not hurting anymore, and it's peaceful. Waking up is horrible and confusing and once you start warming up, you go through the pain all over again.

Suffocation is definitely the worst I've experienced. Once you run out of air, it burns like fuck, every last bit of your being is struggling for oxygen and instinct kicks in, you thrash around and fight, and you're just filled with complete and utter terror. Probably the most scared you'll ever be. Then you just feel everything start fading. Not just your vision. Your thoughts, your energy... everything. Every part of you keeps fighting against it but you know you're not going to win. Didn't reach complete unconsciousness with that one, but I doubt there's any peace in it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It happened pretty naturally. My best friend was going through hard times, we had a wild night with drugs, and things just happened. It was incredible, so it kept happening. We realised we had feelings for each other, but situations didn't really let that be a thing. Situation eventually ended with him living on my sofa, which quickly turned to staying in my bed every night. Eventually when his situation calmed down, it turned into an actual relationship, which was amazing for a while. That is, until his abusive psycho ex (unsurprisingly, the reason he was in a bad place before) came back into the picture looking for sympathy and "friendship". Also, my mental health, issues the uncertainty before had caused me and his own issues started becoming a problem. In the end, we ended up splitting with the intent of fixing our issues and trying again fresh. He ended up fucking his ex, turning against me once she got back into his head, and taking most of our mutual friends with him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I kind of relate. Just came out of a long term friendship-turned-relationship that started off incredible and went pretty bad (including turning to physical abuse on my ex partner's side towards the end.) we left it off on friendly terms agreeing to work on ourselves and try again if that succeeds, agreeing that we both had issues. I began trying to do just that (struggling beyond belief, come to realise that my head is pretty fucked) and they... immediately decided to fuck their previous ex (relationship ended for the same issues, plus physical and mental abuse from her), binge on drugs with her and bring her into the shared accommodation we both live in on a near permanent basis, while rejecting any and all help. You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. Feelings are still there, but I don't really see anything changing any time soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look buddy, as much as you're going to want to believe it and no matter how hard you're going to try, things don't get better from here. They get a whole lot worse, especially now you're basically trapped here. You're going to get away from your parents' house, but the pain of the things they said and how they treated you won't go away. It'll haunt you at night and in every raised voice or threatening movement from even the people you trust most. The outside world isn't much better either, a new place will be exciting at first but you'll quickly learn that shit is expensive, and even though you'll eventually walk again, you'll never be able to hold down a decent job. You'll get bored of art when you realise you're not that good and never will be. You'll find love, but the first couple of times won't work, they're just random people you latch onto to try to feel less empty, and they'll hurt you. A lot. But when you find the real thing, holy fuck, it'll be incredible, far more than you ever could have imagined. But you realise pretty quickly that by then you'll be far too fucked up to have a healthy relationship, and no matter how hard you try, it won't last. Oh, and that horrible, deep hopelessness in the pit of your stomach? It doesn't go away. You can distract yourself from it for a while (drugs help, until they stop helping), but it'll always be there, and you'll fuck everything up for yourself trying to escape it. By the way, get some practice in tying knots behind your back when you're able. Instinct kicks in quicker than you'd think, and the first thing you're going to do is rip that bag off your head. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Whenever I express my depression or how awful and painful everyday life is, and just how much I wish I wasn't here anymore, I'm always met with this same message at least once. "It gets better!"


And now, around a decade on from my first suicide attempt, I'm forced to look back on my life. Did it get better?


The answer is a pretty resounding "no". 6 attempts on (Yeah, I'm pretty terrible at it apparently) I can pretty confidently say that things have not gotten better. They've gotten worse. From the first time I tried to end my own life, there's been a pretty steep downwards slope in pretty much every aspect of my life, especially my mental health. A series of painful relationships that always managed to leave me in a worse place I started off in, debt, declining physical health including increasingly severe chronic pain, friendships that dissolve into nothing and leave me totally alone as everyone moves forward around me and I just keep going backwards.


So, 10 years on, I find myself in a shitty little room in a shared house because it's all I can afford, several grand in debt, living with my recent ex who I have to watch move on back to their previous ex, right in front of me, every day. My mental health is looking worse, I'm on my 3rd attempt at medication, and so far it's only aggravating another mental health condition that I've developed over the past decade, and helping me sleep- with the added bonus of vivid dreams, which means more night terrors. My physical health is in a pretty steep decline too, I'm in pain every single second of every single day, and it looks like I'll never be able to work again. Nothing brings me any enjoyment or even mild comfort anymore, fuck, I'm not even allowed drugs or alcohol on this new medication. It's been two weeks since I fucked up my last suicide attempt, and the mental health team are already losing interest. Again.

I can't even see a point in trying, at this point. Life has made it pretty clear what it has in store for me. I don't have any hobbies or interests to pour myself into because, well, I just don't enjoy anything anymore. Most of my days are spent staring into nothingness, trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong. Or thinking of how to explain this crushing hopelessness to people. Neither really help. I've pretty much learned now that I can't have a healthy relationship, I just drag down anyone who tries to be with me. Learned I can't have kids a few years ago. Getting a good job isn't really an option anymore thanks to my physical health and how bad my mental health has gotten. Can't afford to move anywhere that doesn't have a shared living room that smells of crack thanks to the guy downstairs, and where I can store my food in the freezer or refrigerator without it getting stolen. So what now? Where do you go when up just isn't an option anymore? Do I just keep digging down because if I die in 5-10 years of something inevitable, it'll hurt the few remaining people who give a fuck less, if they're still around?

The idea that things will always get better if you try hard enough is cruel and unrealistic. Sure, for a lot of people, they do. But sometimes they don't. And we just seem to sweep these cases under the rug and try to console them with the same empty, overused phrases. All I want is for this to end before it keeps getting worse. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know how it effects those around me, and that's why I haven't done it yet. But that doesn't make all of this pain and this constant struggle any more bearable. Things AREN'T going to get better. They're guaranteed to get worse. Nobody will help me, I've tried EVERY. SINGLE. POSSIBLE. ROUTE. I'm getting left behind by the only people who can do anything to make it bearable. I'm in constant physical and emotional pain, and the physical pain is guaranteed to only get worse. Give it a few years and I won't be able to look after myself at all, though my mental health seems to be doing that to me by itself. Sometimes I sit for hours, terrified while my brain just gives up on doing things even vaguely normally because it's so fucking broken now. Nobody's here to help me when that happens anymore, I have to go through it alone. It's not unheard of for me to try to kill myself when it happens, next time nobody will be there to stop me anyway.

If my illness was purely physical, this would be the point they'd start thinking about letting me die, for the sake of kindness. So why, when there's still nothing that can be done, is it selfish for me to decide enough is enough just because it's my brain that went wrong? Why do I have to keep going until I get to the point where I slowly starve to death, just because it isn't the RIGHT kind of illness? Suicide isn't someone being selfish, it's someone losing the battle with a terminal illness. Maybe you'll never understand unless you yourself end up hurting so badly that it's the only option you can see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The law isn't always perfect, but the statistics say that it's almost always going to be on your side simply because of how you were born.

You want to play the victim game? My own mother abused me for the first 21 years of my life. When I, as a sick, helpless teenager who had just battled for my life against a disease that kills more people than not, went to professionals for help because this woman who had all control over my life because I literally could not look after myself was beating the shit out of me and making me feel that I didn't deserve to be alive on a daily basis, they didn't fucking care. No, they questioned the truth of everything I said, and all they really cares about was whether or not it was really my stepdad who was harming me. I tried every route I could possibly see to try to find help. Because of this fucked up system I continued to live in that situation for another 8 years, spending half of that on the streets or the sofas of people I barely knew once I was well enough to make any kind of escape, but still having to go back so that I didn't starve to death or freeze in the winter. Anywhere I called for help either hung up when they heard a male voice, told me I had to get my shit together by myself, or directed me to resources on how to avoid escalating the situation or becoming an abuser. I FINALLY escaped when one organisation offered me a place to stay, but I had to wait months for a place, because they had to make sure that they didn't let their housing, for a homeless population that is over 70% male, drop below their quota of 50% female occupants, or they'd lose funding.

You came here to make this all about you, that's pretty clear, but it's not. I'm sure in the same breath you would berate any man who walked into a discussion on a primarily female issue and tried to make it about him and men, so please practice some self awareness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am personally friends with men who have been drugged and raped by women before. Even with evidence there is no legal justice in those situations, so how could you think there might be in mine? I just watched someone very close to me finally escape a relationship with a woman who blackmailed him, physically attacked him, and deliberately pushed him to the brink of suicide several times. She still has the power when it comes to deciding what happens when the child she used to blackmail him is born.

It must be nice being so used to a world that actually cares about your safety and wellbeing that you assume it's the norm for everyone. It's not. </TEXT>

Unless you think anti vaxxers, flat earthers and the rest are right, you can't possibly not be seeing this.

When you go on Facebook or whatever you use and see "vaccinated child dies", do you think "Wow, vaccines clearly kill children!" or do you think "I guess there are other factors to childhood death than preventable diseases"?

Similarly, when you see "Trans person does something bad" do you think, "All trans people bad!!!" or do you think "People of various demographics can be bad, trans people are just as capable of bad things as any other demographic"? </TEXT>

I think my last resort if things get too bad and I've got no help is probably to admit myself to a mental health facility.

<TEXT> Femaledatingstrategy goes through phases of looking pretty normal, but big events that they deem important cause a massive explosion of very aggressive activity. Comments are also usually far worse than the posts. Domestic abuse towards men, raping of men and things like sabotaging condoms and lying about birth control to "trap" men are very heavily supported and encouraged there.

As for thefairersex, the admins are definitely not being "proactive". The sub is exactly what they intend, everything about it encourages the behaviour. From what I've heard though, most of their activity is in their chat rooms.

Either way, I highly doubt any of them will be quarantined. All of them have been around for longer than incel subs tend to last. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And the same kinds of subs for women DON'T fester extremism and result in harassment?

Where do I start...

r/gendercritical is honestly a fucking horrible place. They doxx people on a regular basis with the intention of encouraging violence, are responsible for countless organised assaults and acts of public harassment, people there talk about and encourage violence regularly, and the entire sub revolves around hate for more than one group of people. Genocide is often discussed. Not quarantined.

r/femaledatingstrategy is VERY well known for encouraging women to be violent towards their partners, even encouraging drugging and rape, is pretty much a perfect mirror of typical incel subs in every way, and works pretty much like a cult. Not quarantined.

r/trufemcels almost definitely started off as a joke sub, but there's a growing base of radicalisation, sexism, encouragement of violence, and, well, pretty much general incel behaviour. Not quarantined.

r/thefairersex is just... Wow. The full arsenal. Sexism, hate, radicalisation, incitement of violence, actual history of being responsible for domestic abuse and violence... a lot of the people there genuinely hate any and every man. Genocide, forced sterilisation and such ideas are a common topic. And guess what? Not quarantined.

I'm sure there are other, smaller subs, but this gives you a good taster. </TEXT>

Also, notice how incel subs get quarantined, but subs for women with the exact same attitude towards men and the exact same amount of aggression, incitement of violence, and hate don't? That's probably an issue with a much bigger bias, even enormously popular, violently, aggressively transphobic subs don't get quarantined, as long as they're radical feminist in stance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If Conservative subs get quarantined for something, left subs should get quarantined for doing the same thing. Either that, or we don't quarantine subs at all.

To be honest, I think quarantining has done more harm than good anyway. Removing a space for people to express an opinion doesn't stop them from having that opinion. When those subs are quarantined, their members just feel more like everyone else is against them and censoring them, which makes them more angry, and causes them to look for/create more places to express their opinions. That then spreads angry trolls across the site and causes them to invade and take over previously benign subs. Isn't it better to just let hateful people stay in their own spaces? </TEXT>

As for my only other close friend, his ex girlfriend who he still has to live with, and still has a very strong grip on him through violence and blackmail with his unborn child, won't let him visit me on my own, because she knows things have happened between us since they broke up. Can't even visit my parents, since even though my mum has been on better terms with me since we broke up, my stepdad still makes it very clear that he hates me, and my dad lives in another country.

<TEXT> People who aren't irrationally scared of something they don't understand don't center a large portion of their lives around making sure that everyone knows they disagree the result with years of work, research and trial and error by trained professionals, simply because of a few opinion pieces and other angry, scared individuals on the Internet- despite the fact that the thing they're arguing about has near zero impact on their lives. There is no other motivation besides irrational fear, fed by other people with the same irrational fear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They have that choice in incredibly rare situations under very heavy evaluation from a large team of professionals over a long period of time, who agree that they probably aren't going to even live into adulthood if they aren't provided it. That choice is also completely reversible. I don't see your point. Minors are allowed to be given much more extreme and permanent treatments at a far younger age with far fewer precautions for other conditions, yet I don't see nearly as much outrage about those. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Children can't make those decisions. They legally can't be given the choice to make permanent. That hasn't changed.

And hormone blockers are only used in very extreme cases, and are probably a preferable alternative to that child ending up killing themselves. Also not permanent or overall life changing if they don't end up going through with the entire transition when they're old enough to make the decision, though they usually do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Almost everyone who undergoes that treatment reports improvement on their symptoms of gender dysphoria.

For one, since the majority people who have currently received those treatments so far haven't received the full benefits due to either having started hormones late in life and receiving lesser effects, as well has having received earlier, less advanced forms of the surgeries, we can't actually be certain how those statistics will play out in the future. Secondly, there's definitely a very large societal factor to it. I mean, if you got treated for your medical condition but a large portion of society decided to make it a large priority in their life to make as big a deal as possible about you receiving that treatment and make sure that you know at every second of your life that they disagree with it and think you shouldn't have had it, would that be great for your quality of life? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Labia aren't even vaguely comparable to the foreskin. The foreskin holds the vast majority of the nerve endings in the penis, and is responsible for most of its intended function.

The clitoral hood is the anatomical female equivalent of the foreskin. Except in women, the clitoral hood only really serves to protect the nerves of the clitoris from over stimulation and keratinisation, whereas in men, it protects the head of the penis in the same way, as well as providing the intended mechanical function during sex (circumcised men almost always need additional artifical lubrication for sex to avoid pain for both partners) as well as preventing infections and other damage.

<TEXT> Sorry, but that article is the biggest heap of clickbait bullshit I have ever seen in my life. Its not even vaguely related to its title. The author pulled the concept of 12 year olds suddenly being able to transition without parental consent directly from their ass.

The actual factual content of the article is about absolutely nothing besides access to transitional treatments being mentioned in a law giving people under the age of 26 who are in or aged out of the foster care system access to medical treatment. It didn't suddenly become a thing that 12 year olds can now get free hormones. Sure, they might receive the initial therapy, evaluations and diagnosis for gender dysphoria, and this makes it illegal for them to be denied it if its deemed necessary, but, no, they're still not going to receive hormones and surgery until they're old enough.

Sure, the moderator could have dealt with it by actually explaining what was up, but the fact that you very clearly shared it without even reading it because it sounded like it might potentially back up your world view is totally on you. People like you are destroying the Internet just as much as censorship is- this is the reason that absolutely anyone can write any random, unsourced bullshit and have it accepted as total truth. </TEXT>

It makes you come across as immature and petty, and makes people far less likely to listen to what you have to say, even if you have good points. Some people's minds just can't be changed, but you're more likely to get points across if you actually explain them in a reasonable and understanding way.

Secondly "trigger" and it's variation and context was initially used to describe things that set off symptoms of various mental illnesses, and yeah, it's definitely been very heavily overused and basically stripped of any real meaning. But again, using it in a demeaning way towards people isn't going to make them listen to you, it just makes you seem immature and petty yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Have you ever noticed that type 1 and 2 are always put together in the 85% statistic? That's a form of data manipulation. Type 2 is only slightly more common than type 3. Type 1 in itself is data manipulation in how its presented, because the vast majority of type 1 FGM does not include removal of the actual clitoris at all, it almost entirely consists of partial or total removal of the hood, which is, perhaps, comparable to circumcision. (That said, the foreskin has more actual function and nerve endings than the clitoral hood.)

Trying to decide which one is worse than the other is, in itself, stupid. Complaining about people calling genital mutilation what it literally is because you don't think it's as bad is stupid. We're allowed to dislike more than one horrible thing happening to more than one group of people.

It is absolutely indisputable that circumcision is a procedure that, at best, permanently damages sexual function, and at worst, permanently causes serious, life destroying damage and pain to and even kills countless newborn babies. In ALL non-medical cases it is done either for religious reasons just like FGM, or to uphold some ridiculous, fucked up societal standard that penises are ugly and "unclean" if a large portion of their functional tissue isn't removed. It's also seen as completely acceptable in fully developed countries to perform the procedure without any anaesthesia, and honestly, cutting off part of someone's body for no medical benefit before they're even old enough to understand or make that decision themselves is just wrong. </TEXT>

-Less likelyhood of accidental death at work

-Less likelyhood of being assaulted or murdered

-More help as a victim of abuse

-No chance of being arrested FOR being physically abused thanks to duluth model

In most cases where only one partner is abusive, its the woman, and same sex relationships between two women have the highest rates of violence.

As for child abuse, in households where only one parent is abusive, it's most commonly the mother, and young boys are more likely to be victims. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Actually, if you look into the communities that these attitudes tend to stem from, it's more learned behaviour than actual exposure to people being dicks. If you go on a site like Deviantart, the vast majority of the kids acting like this have never actually received any criticism before they start acting like this. They turn up, get involved in the community, see everyone acting like this, and think it's the right way to go. People tend to imitate their friends, and especially people they look up to, such as other artists they like or take inspiration from. Kids are particularly impressionable with this.

As for the rest, a lot of artists do that. It's not because of other people, it's because you will always see and acknowledge your own mistakes more than other people do. The healthy way to deal with it is to force yourself to look your work over, take note of your mistakes, and either fix them or keep them in mind for next time. That's how you improve. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Encouraging young artists to try is one thing. But there's an incredibly toxic community around young artists of this type that discourages criticism and improvement. If nobody is allowed to point out mistakes or give advice because it's seen as a personal attack, then the artists get stuck in a cycle of repeating those same mistakes over and over. THAT'S why young artists give up. They sooner or later realise that they're not progressing or developing any individuality, and they don't know how. And since they've been conditioned to think that the people who want to help are just assholes, they give up instead.

Sure there's a few people just being assholes to young artists for the sake of it, but the attitude of "If you don't think it's perfect, fuck you!" is exactly the problem here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sounds very similar to a situation I'm in now, except romantic feelings are mutual but circumstances are pretty unforgiving in that respect.

It's really hard feeling like you're not able to be there for someone you care deeply about as much as you want to be. But I'm sure she knows that you've been trying your hardest, and really appreciates that. Getting over the romantic part will be hard too, but you do need to be honest with yourself. Feelings aren't selfish since you can't control them, it's only the actions you take because of them that have the potential to be selfish. Sometimes you need to let feelings out on some level to get over them though, you just need to find a healthy and non-damaging way to do so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know people are going to see this as a horrible thing to say at first glance, but it's true. You can't just tell someone to love themselves and it'll just happen. It doesn't work like that. People's minds work differently.

Someone who sees loving themselves as a realistic and reachable goal to achieve before anything else is never going to understand someone who struggles with it. "Loving yourself" isn't even a term with any kind of deep universal meaning, it's just that- an empty, overused phrase. It could mean many things. Self respect, self worth, self esteem... people who get told to love themselves could be struggling with any or all of those things and more, and they're not things people can just decide to fix one day. It takes time, lots of it, and pretty often some very intensive therapy. Some people never manage it, just learn to cope in other ways. That doesn't mean they can't have a fulfilling life.

So, no, people don't have to "love themselves first". All that says is that people struggling with their mental health don't deserve love or aren't capable of fulfilling relationships. The only necessary thing is to learn how to have and maintain a healthy relationship, something a lot of people who do "love themselves" can't do. </TEXT>

Due to how emotionally dependent I was made and the terms on which it ended, I was very, deeply suicidal afterwards, and made two separate attempts on my life.

My mental health has made another pretty steep relapse recently, but the whole situation had me connect with some of the most important people in my life, who had watched the whole thing unfold. With their support I've gotten myself out of the situation that made me do vulnerable to that form of abuse in the first place, found a lot of interests that are now pretty important to my life, and made huge amounts of self improvement. </TEXT>

The thing with people disliking uncut penises is because circumcision is so normalised. They've been told that uncut penises are weird and gross. In most of the rest of the world, it's normal and nobody cares. In fact, circumcised penises are functionally very different and don't do what they're meant to. That's scientific fact. You're allowed to be comfortable with yourself, I'm not saying that. I'm saying that chopping off a functioning, normal part of someone else's body because society said so, regardless of what they personally want shouldn't be allowed.

<TEXT> The BBC was only allowed to show very vague support for remain, it couldn't run any kind of remain campaign. All of the propaganda and advertisement most people saw was pro brexit. Also, Cameron got what he wanted, he just didn't want to be the one who had to deal with the bullshit, and didn't want his face on it. That's how corrupt politicians work. He pushed for it pretty hard.

>Is Germany heading into recession the fault of b****t as well?

How is that relevant or a point in any way? Our problems are PROVEN to be part of brexit. Companies from the EU don't want to operate in the UK anymore, because it'll be more expensive after brexit. So they're leaving and taking all of the jobs and money with them. Exactly the opposite of what our shitty government promised.

I admire your optimism, but this isn't getting better, it's getting worse. We're losing a lot. There's lots of people on the streets and starving. You're probably fine in your upper-middle class economic sanctuary, but the rest of us fucking aren't. </TEXT>

Also I'm pretty sure trying to tell us about the economic crisis that is already starting to happen wouldn't be lying, even if the campaign to stay got more than a tiny shred of funding. The leave campaign was EVERYWHERE. And backed by the government that's currently in power, which makes a big difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Except brexit was fuelled by lies and propaganda. Originally we were promised that the EU would be ready to give us a great deal straight away, it would be good for the economy and that a no deal was not a possility. We were also promised full control over a bunch of stuff. All of that turned out to be bullshit, nobody wants to give us anything, we won't even have the control we were promised, and we've got a guy in power who actively wants a no deal brexit. We were lied to, none of the so called benefits we were promised will happen, turns out its actually going to throw us into economic chaos, none of the problems used to encourage us to leave will be solved by it or in most cases, even exist.

A vote influenced heavily by lies and propaganda by our own government is democratic. It wasn't even a legally binding vote.

We're also in a situation where an election should have been triggered almost immediately, but things were twisted and essentially, political blackmail was used, so it wasn't.

Brexit is not a good example of a democratic decision at all, it's a great example of corrupt governments manipulating the populace. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It doesn't "cancel" biological sex, it causes gender dysphoria. The only way proven to actually treat gender dysphoria is transition, because you can change someone's body but you can't change their entire brain. It's neurological, and cannot be treated through therapy or other means. Treating the condition and allowing someone to live a comfortable, fulfilling life is way more important than you getting unreasonably uncomfortable that someone might be peeing in peace in a completely closed off stall vaguely close to someone else because you're convinced that anyone who has or has had a penis is a sexual predator. It makes a lot more sense than someone who appears mostly or entirely as a woman peeing in a men's bathroom, especially if that person has fully transitioned. It's also totally free to not be a sweltering asshole and let people live their lives comfortably. </TEXT>

There are people who study just this thing for their jobs, but they're wrong because you have Google and the ability to pick and choose your information from biased sources. I could literally go have an MRI scan right now and prove you wrong. There's also a very strong correlation with hormone levels and a bunch of other stuff, like trans men (FtM) having a disproportionately high rate of PCOS, which is essentially an intersex condition.

<TEXT> I hate writing these things, but sometimes it's the only way to get my feelings out without worrying or hurting those around me. They're already going through a lot.

I'm just starting to feel like there's no point to any of this. Or, not just starting, just having my feelings reinforced once again.

Feels like life has a way of taunting me. It gives me a taste of happiness- a few days, maybe a week or two if I'm lucky. And then it rips it away as hard as it can, causing as much damage as possible. I can't remember ever being happy for long. I try my best to prevent anyone from ever feeling the pain I feel, but it just seems like I'm not allowed anything for myself. I don't even know if I can be happy anymore, my brain has learned to stop me from hoping or looking forward to things, because in the end, it always just goes wrong.

Of course, I'm going to get the usual "can't have light without darkness" or "it gets better". But you don't understand. There is no light, it's always false. I've been waiting for it to get better for a long time, trying everything I possibly can to dig myself out of this forever deepening hole, but somehow I just keep falling, further and further into the pitch black. I just want to give up now, I'm tired. So, so incredibly tired. I don't want to hurt again. If I could find a way to make sure that everyone would be fine without me, and nobody would be hurt by the loss of me, I'd do it in a heart beat.

Don't bother showing me helplines. I've called nearly all of them, and left knowing that the person on the other end doesn't care and/or can't help. Generally, I hang up wanting to die more. I'm not going to kill myself right now, either, for the afformentioned reason. I just want to get this down somewhere so it doesn't have to hang like an unbearable weight on my mind.

I gave myself a year two months ago, to wrap up unfinished business and ease the people I care about away enough to be forgotten. It's going to be hard to make it that long, but I plan to stick to that promise. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The way I see it, I notice two different "strains" of non-binary people, if you will.

The political side, in which people use it as a method of rejecting gender roles, largely based in feminism and surrounding politics,

And the people who have gender dysphoria in a way that they wouldn't be comfortable fully transitioning to the opposite sex, but don't feel comfortable as their birth sex either.

The latter was very well excepted, albeit fairly rare in the trans community for a VERY long time, but the prior made things pretty confusing when it started becoming common, and that lead to people conflating gender roles with gender. Then, because they're being told by outside sources that the two are one and the same (since there was already a deep misunderstanding of trans people common in general society, and assuming it's gender role related was, and still is, a very common misconception) the first kind sort of... integrated into the trans community, and we got where we are today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When species go extinct, there's generally enough time for a new branch of that species to evolve to adapt to the new environment. If the environment changes too quickly, such as with man-made climate change or an enormous meteorite throwing the ecosystem into chaos, species don't have the time to evolve to be compatible with the new environment, and everything dies out.

Sure, mass extinction events have happened and life has survived a few so far, but it's not a great gamble to bank on that happening again, and, let's face it, humanity probably isn't going to be one of those species that survives. If we can prevent causing a mass extinction event, we probably should. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The vast majority of non binary "genders" are based around the idea that gender isn't based on sex, which, yes, directly works to invalidate and directly contradicts gender dysphoria and trans people as a whole. Though fairly uncommon, it is possible for people with dysphoria to be non-binary, however thats not what things like "agender" and, in the vast majority of cases, genderfluidity, are about. They're about gender roles and using trans people as a political weapon, and actually work to enforce gender roles.

The "non binary" community as we know it is fighting towards the demedicalisation of trans people and implies that being trans is a choice rather than biological and inborn, which means that treatments like hormones and transitional surgeries would be considered cosmetic rather than the life saving treatments they are, and would be inaccessible by people who rely on services like the NHS, or their insurance.

Please, don't talk about things you know nothing about. </TEXT>

I guess if better get used to not only not having someone special to rely on and be relied on by when everyone else is busy, but I also have to lose the last of the people close to me to greater responsibilities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I need help. But I know I'm never going to go through with finding it. I know I'll hold it together, keep going somehow, because I don't want to bother or inconvenience anyone. Whenever I feel like I can't do it anymore, when I feel like I might just totally break down, even when I've sat and considered killing myself, I think of what it would do to the people around me, and I just suck it up and keep going. But it's hard, and I'm so emotionally and mentally exhausted. How long can I just live for other people?

My mind is absolute hell. I hate myself in so many ways, no matter what I do to stop it I just can't. I'm constantly worried and embarrassed about the way I look, the way I act, every detail of everything I do. I feel like everyone around me thinks I'm weird and unappealing in every way and no amount of reassurance otherwise helps. I can't even be alone anymore because the moment everything is quiet, my mind starts running through every flaw in everything I do, whether it was today or 5 years ago. I always assume the worst whenever anything happens, and convince myself that I deserve it anyway.

I know I need help, and I know that maybe someone, somewhere, could offer it, but when I get to the point of seeking it, I never feel like my problems are bad enough or important enough. I feel like I'm just being stupid, making it all up in my head and seeking attention. I've spoken to a couple of people I know about the basics of my problems, but even then, I feel like I'm seeking attention I don't deserve or bothering them. So I just keep it to myself, running it through my mind over and over again.

I'm pretty much only alive because my death would be an inconvenience. I'm not happy, I'm not really all that important to anyone, I'm not really good at anything, and I don't have any direction in life. I feel like the only reason people like me is because I'm "nice" and don't know how to say no when people ask for things, I don't even really have a personality anymore. I don't know why anyone WOULD actually like me.

It'll be an achievement if I even end up posting this instead of just deleting it, nobody's going to actually care, and I don't really want them to. Strangers telling me "it'll get better!" or giving me advice that I've been given a million times won't help. Maybe I want to just allow myself to process feeling like utter shit outside of my own head for once. Maybe it'll keep me going a little bit longer, until next time. Maybe in some weird, convoluted way it'll help someone else. Maybe it is just attention seeking through the anonymity of the Internet and I'm just a complete asshole who doesn't deserve anyone to read this. Who knows. Even I don't really know why I did it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm getting to that age where all of my friends are in relationships, starting to make things serious and get engaged, things like that. Nobody really has time for me anymore, because they have someone more important to spend their free time on. Two of my closest friends are together, and they hang out with me some of the time, but most of the time they just want to be alone together when they're not at work. They're always saying I should get into a relationship so that we could go on double dates, but... that seems like it's not going to happen. I'm just the one dingle friend that people occasionally get a chance to see when their significant other is busy.

I wish I could have someone like that, someone who's always got time for me and I've always got time for them. Someone I'm closer to than anyone else. But somehow I've never met a single person who lives me for who I am. I've been in one "relationship"... but it turns out he wasn't really interested in me, and I was the only one desperate enough to stick with him do he could leech off of what little money I had, and thinking that somehow it would make me feel less alone, I did for two months before I had enough. We were never really intimate in any way, but it was something.

Turns out that as soon as people find out one thing about me, it nullifies all interest they had. Of all the people I've met and tried to prove to that I'm worthy of some kind of love, if they've ever been interested in who I am, that one thing breaks the deal. I try to stay hopeful, but it's hard when every person says the same thing. No matter how much I work to make myself comfortable and happy, and no matter how far I've come, nobody else can feel the same about my progress.

And now it's been so long that I'm alone in pretty much every way. I go out alone, I sit in my flat at night alone, I spend most weekends alone. I just want to be normal. </TEXT>

<TITLE> On the erasure of trans men in the trans community </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-04-17 22:03:20 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> First of all, I hope that the majority of you will welcome this here. I have generally found the members of this sub to be open minded and accepting of all men, but honestly, it's a pretty big leap of faith to put something like this into a main post. I hope you guys won't disappoint me.

Secondly, I wasn't sure what flair to put this under, so I would appreciate if someone could correct me if there is a better choice.

Now, the subject at hand.




Trans people are becoming a far more recognised in society in the past few years. But one major flaw in all of this activism and support has been visible to the observant few. Where are the trans men?

As trans people has become more visible in our culture, trans women have always been in the lead. Many television shows have featured trans people recently, for better or for worse- from soap operas, to documentaries, but they all hold one thing in common- they rarely, if ever, feature trans men. Even when major factual television creators such as the BBC have covered the subject, one or two "token" trans men are represented at most. Netflix holds many notable factual films based on the lives of trans women, but the only commonly known, high budget film representing trans men available is Boys Don't Cry- a film featuring a highly feminine presented trans man, lots of partial nudity, and a tone that outright blames Brandon Teena's attempts to live as a man for his murder- a "cautionary" tale with a single message- don't be a trans man.

This deeply represents the situation in the trans community itself. Almost all major figureheads in the trans community are trans women, and most major festivals based on trans pride are heavily based in feminine imagery, and are, again, run by trans women, with rarely a trans man in sight. (example; Sparkle in the Park Manchester, the UK's largest trans event.) Even the flag itself represents this, with pink inner stripes to represent the "true self", and blue outer stripes to represent the body- again, made by a trans woman.

It even goes deep enough to affect the treatments offered- current vaginoplasty techniques are vastly more advanced than phalloplasty and has continued to improve at a far faster rate.

So, what's the cause? A lot of people will try to offer an answer, and the vast majority are feminists and trans women. The common theme of these attempted explanations usually revolve one or more of 3 themes.

1: Straight, cisgendered (not trans) men don't find it funny to joke about trans men, therefore nobody cares.

2: Trans women are hated or admired for going against "the patriarchy" and trans men are just boring.

3: Trans men have male privilege and therefore don't need support.

However, the third only ever seems to be used as a backup if a further question is asked... if straight, non-trans men are to be blamed for the erasure of trans men, then why does the majority of it come from within the LGBT community?

Attempts by trans men to spread awareness of their existence are usually met by protest and hatred, even threats of violence, and the main perpetrators of this reaction are... trans women. A lot of trans women have shown that they don't want trans men to be represented, whether in media, events, or simple support groups. And situation involving the representation of trans men is usually met with accusations of "transmisogyny", taking away "much needed" attention from trans women, or sexism.

The LGBT community can be an incredibly hostile environment for trans men, with individuals often straight up told to stay quiet and listen to the issues of trans women without contributing. Support is vastly lacking for a group usually undergoing stressful, life changing processes, and with such a high rate of suicide, because attempts to provide it are usually met with hostility. This cannot remain silent any longer. It needs to be spoken about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's be fair, nobody is ever going to love me. 3.5% of men are gay or bi. A ridiculously small fraction of those are going to be attracted to trans men at all. An even smaller percentage of those are going to be attracted to me specifically.

It's essentially impossible for me to find someone who is attracted to me and will remain so when I tell them I am trans (which I do almost immediately when someone shows attraction to me, for the sake of honesty)

I am probably never going to be in a relationship of mutual attraction.

I am destined for a life without romantic love, or sex. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Breathing discomfort? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-02-15 21:56:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>

Age: 21

Sex: Male

Height: 171cm

Weight:

Race: White british

Location on body: Throat/lungs

Any existing relevant medical issues: Septic arthritis, hemiparesis (left side), epilepsy (treated)

Current medications: Levetiracetam

&#x200B;

I can't say for certain how long this has been going on for, I've been experiencing it as long as I can remember, but in the past couple of months it has gotten quite a lot more frequent, and in some cases, more severe.


The best way I can describe it is that sometimes breathing in becomes uncomfortable, sometimes to the point where I have to stop mid-breath. This doesn't usually last more than a few minutes at a time, but has sometimes lasted for around half an hour or more. I'm not sure that I can describe the sensation beyond that it is uncomfortable, but it seems to originate in my lungs and throat, and can stop me from inhaling completely. My breathing isn't affected in any other way than this, and the shortness of breath that it can cause after a while. There doesn't seem to be any particular circumstances that cause it, it can happen while I'm outside, walking, sitting down, laying down, anything.


I am a smoker, but very infrequently (a recent test showed me as a non-smoker) and as previously mentioned, this has persisted for longer than I have been smoking. There haven't been any recent changes that I can associate with the problem getting worse. When I was younger, it could be set off by being exposed to second hand smoke, but it rarely happens when exposed to smoke now.


Thank you for any help, getting an appointment with a GP is near impossible for me at the moment, and I've never thought to bring it up before due to it not being as bad as it is now. I just want to know if there's any chance it could be something to worry about before trying to make an appointment. </TEXT>

When the cannons drop, they go transparent for a moment before they're meant to materialise properly, but on my game, they remain transparent and unusable permanently, so I cant do any damage to the Sorceress. I've tried dying, restarting the level, leaving and coming back, even exiting the game and trying again.

Is anyone else having this problem? Does anyone know a fix?  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> We've had the same neighbours since we moved in. It was pretty obvious the kind of people they were, they spent the first year or so after we moved in renovating their house. We just thought, sure, maybe we moved in at a bad time.
We were wrong.
Since then, they've rarely gone more than a few months since renovating in some way. Even when I got back from hospital after nearly dying of Meningitis, and clearly needed my sleep, they would start at 5am every morning with some kind of work. Not to mention that the daughter, who has the room on the other side of the separating wall from mine, would constantly play music at full volume whenever there wasn't work going on.

Now, about seven years on, I still live here due to the difficulties my illness left me with, and the daughter now has her boyfriend and young kid living there.
The regular routine is, at every morning, almost dead on 6:30am, the music starts. This usually wakes me up. Then the boyfriend makes loud, irritating noises at the kid for a full hour. Then, around 11am...

VR. VRRRR! VRRRRRRRRRR!!!

The fucking drilling.
They've been drilling the same wall almost every day for months, which happens to be the separating wall. I don't know how many more holes they can put it the thing before it just falls down. I can see no logical reason for this to be happening.

The worst part of all is that for about a week in the summer, around my birthday, I had the house to myself. I had a few friends over for a couple of those days, and we told everyone there would be music.
When my parents got back, they told them a whole load of bullshit about my friends swearing at them out of the window, and complained that the dog had been barking while I was out one day.

Unfortunately, whenever I have even mentioned complaining, my parents go wild because they don't want to make enemies with the neighbours. Fuck, I think they've made it pretty clear that they WANT to be enemies. But no, I'm not allowed to do anything about these irritating, inconsiderate pricks.  </TEXT>

<DATE> 2018-11-10 11:44:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had top surgery 2 days ago, and just made it home from the hospital last night (I was kept in 2 days, and had a half day long trip home- which is probably why they kept me in for so long) and I just wanted to ask a few questions, since I'm not really a fan of calling up the hospital if I don't have to. I'm aware that any information I get here is going to be from personal experience rather than from the point of a medical professional, and I will contact the hospital if necessary.


First of all is to do with the drains. They seem to be doing their job normally, and I haven't been given any reason to think that they aren't working as intended, but since the initial numbness started to wear off, I've noticed that they actually hurt a bit. It feels like the tubing is digging into my ribs or something, especially close to the incisions they they are fed in through and along the bottom of my pec, as well as a little bit of stinging/burning and itching around the incisions. I'm not sure if this is just noticeable because I tend to be reluctant to take painkillers unless I feel like I REALLY need them, but I thought I'd just check whether this is a thing that most people are experiencing or not.


Second is that I'm getting a fair bit of cramp in one of my shoulders, it doesn't really bother me much if I'm sitting still, but if I'm reaching for something or doing my exercises, it can be quite painful, and that pain usually persists when I then sit or lie down to rest.


Thanks in advance for any help and advice I receive here </TEXT>

<TITLE> Eyebrow re-piercing time frame </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-07-22 00:00:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I had two eyebrow piercings (in the same eyebrow) almost a year ago, however my piercer was fairly incompetent and it didn't go well. The first red flag was that it bled EVERYWHERE. There was literally blood running down my face.

I've already had to take one of them out because it wasn't healing and would bleed regularly long after it should have healed past that point, but the other one isn't looking too good either. Today I took it out to give it a thorough clean because, without going into too much detail, it has a tendency of getting pretty gross around the point that the bar and the ball join. It began bleeding pretty badly the moment I took it out, and due to the piercing being kind of misaligned (somehow), putting it back in resulted in a blood blister around the upper end. I think it's probably better to let it heal at this point, but my eyebrow piercings were definitely my favorite in terms of appearance despite the trouble I've had with them, so I was wondering if anyone could give me an approximate time frame between taking it out and being able to get it re-pierced, obviously by a much more trustworthy piercer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yesterday was my city's pride festival. Of course I got involved for the fun and the social opportunities, and of course I ended up back at the bar for the after party.

But then I ended up hanging out with this guy and his friends. Yeah, he was definitely attractive, but I knew he had a girlfriend so I wasn't going to take that anywhere. Or SO I THOUGHT.

Long story short, I cannot trust myself. I comforted him when he got upset when the topic of his self harm history got brought up (I would have thought a perfectly normal friendly thing to do? I have a history of self harm myself so I found it nesseccary) and next thing I know he kisses me. Yeah, weird, but fucking idiot me went along with it with his friends sitting right there. Not to go into too much detail, but he then tried inviting me into the bathrooms with him, which is where I managed to draw the line, but not before we ended up kissing at least twice more.

I am a complete dick and I have no excuse. I'm not searching for sympathy or justification for my actions, I just wanted to get this out of my head. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Why does trans activism hate trans men? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-26 01:30:15 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's a far less discussed part of men's rights, but it definitely needs to be discussed somewhere. To discuss it in anywhere related to trans rights would get you chased out and treated like a bigot. I might not get a better response here, albiet for different reasons, but it's worth a try.

Trans rights have progressed a lot in the past few years, people here obviously have differing opinions on the matter, and I'm not here to talk about that. To anyone who wants to see it, the issue is obvious.

Trans activism has been MtF-centric for a long time now. Every time new media comes out, it's either primarily or exclusively about trans women. To the majority, they don't care, they got what they wanted. To them, that's all there is to trans people that matters. To anyone who speaks out against this, they get hatred and ridicule, and usually are pushed out of their community. This is how it has been for a very long time now, and with the recent rise of feminists and their rhetorics, this has only gotten worse.

It's not just the media, either. Even things such as research for treatments has been effected by this. Surgeries for trans women are far more advanced and well researched than those for trans men.

Is there any way this can ever be fixed? Or are trans men doomed to lurk in the background and watch the progress from afar? </TEXT>

I mean, I generally use this to develop my characters in depth, but situations can get a bit... adult. That doesn't mean in any way that he likes me, though, plus, there's no way I could get to the US, I don't have the kind of money to travel there and permanent residence is pretty much impossible.

I've been trying to brush it off for ages, but last night my brain decided to torture me with a dream where it turned out he had a boyfriend. Why can't things just be simple? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm kind of sad that this sub is essentially dead, but I guess someone has to at least attempt to do something about that.

I'll start with the basics, I guess. I'm a 19 (probably 20 by the time this gets any response) year old trans guy in England. I'm post-T (about 3 months), about 5'7, with a roughly average body type. Unfortunately I'm not particularly interesting (or good at promoting myself really) but at least I'm honest I guess? I can generally be found gaming (console, PC or tabletop). I have a disability (my entire left knee is fucked, among other things. I had meningoencephalitis when I was 13) however I don't need coddling or anything like that, I can take care of myself. I tend to be pretty easy to talk to, but conversations slipping into small talk is my weakness and it can get pretty awkward. I have piercings (spider bites, ear and eyebrow) and a tattoo, and I intend to get more.

What I'm looking for:

First thing I'm going to put out there is that I'm not really looking for anyone beyond the age of about 21/22, with some give. Any other time I've posted on things like this, I get messages from 30+ year old guys. If that's you, you have the complete wrong idea about me, I am sorry. I also only really want someone who lives in the UK, I don't think long distance would work for me, and obviously I don't have a lot of money so travelling isn't easy.

Besides that, I'm not particularly picky, I'd rather actually communicate with someone and see how it goes. I am open to other trans guys, post-T is a bonus, but I do kind of prefer it if you intend to go full op. I can probably work around it if you don't intend to have bottom surgery, but there obviously might be some issues. Also, unlike the rest of the world, short guys are more than welcome. I'm not saying that taller guys are out of the picture, but being towered over isn't really my thing.

Just give it a go, I guess. I tend to be pretty laid back, I'm not going to be a complete dick even if I'm not into you.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> My PIP assessor lied and completely fucked me over </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-05-10 15:07:33 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just got my letter through about my latest assessment for my PIP benefits, and it turns out that my assessor lied entirely. She put that I could walk a completely normal distance without stopping to rest (which I clearly cannot do) that I stood on one leg and touched my toes right in front of her when asked (which I did not and can not do) and that the fact that I sat with my leg bent the whole time was proof that I was fine, when it's the straightening of my leg that is the problem.

I hope she has trouble sleeping at night knowing that I'm going to be homeless the way that this is going. I can't work. Nowhere I ask is capable of taking me on, and I can't work full time anyway. The jobs I could take are limited due to the fact that I can't stand for more than a few minutes at a time. I am completely fucked. So if I disappear from Reddit entirely, it's probably because I'm homeless and dying on the streets because of this complete bitch. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's so ironic that there's an entire sub dedicated to "breaking circlejerks" that consists entirely of radfems circlejerking about things someone said that they don't like. Oh, and suddenly anyone they disagree with is an evil, woman hating right wing extremist. Even when they're left wing and said nothing about women.

Another sub you can't use if you're not a gender theory radical feminist: r/UnpopularOpinion

Bonus: There's an entire sub dedicated to insulting people because they expressed that some of their knowledge comes from personal experience. Also 100% radfem.

<TEXT> I've given myself about a year to get everything done, but I haven't made a complex cosplay before. The character in question is this one:

http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/borderlands/images/6/6d/Zero01.png/revision/latest?cb=20120225231458

I have a basic idea of what I'm doing. I intend to construct the hemet mostly from foam, and somehow create a form to heat some plastic over for the visor, and I will probably use a bpdy suit as the basis for the main costume. I'm not too sure about the specifics though.

I don't really want to paint everything in the shading style of the game, that might be a bit too much. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Elective amputation </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-03-20 21:58:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Years of an essentially useless knee are getting to me. 6 years now. Before this shit, I was a sprinter. I DID shit. I would go out pretty much every day just to be outside. Now my leg is fucked.

I'm 19 years old, I'm young. I should be able to do shit. I should be able to go take a run, go swimming, something. It's driving me crazy. I get told I'm lazy, but what else am I meant to do? A short walk only brings me pain, it can put me out of action for the whole of the next day. I WANT to be out doing something.

Doctors won't do shit anymore. Once my leg would straighten enough for my whole foot to be able to touch the floor, they didn't care anymore. They won't give me a knee replacement because at my age it would need replacing a lot of times through my life, or something like that. Not that it would solve the problem, all of the other joints below the knee are fucked from having to be used in different ways to what they're intended to, anyway, and the muscle holding my leg back from straightening fully could never recover its original length now.

Knowing that I can NEVER have a normal life is killing me. I just don't want to try anymore. I feel like I'm useless, and everyone around me treats me like I'm fragile and always need their help. I can't even go down some stairs without like 5 people crowding around to help me out for brownie points or whatever.

I really just want to know what the policies on elective amputation in the UK are. With a prosthetic I could learn to run and walk like a normal person again, but like this there's no chance. I don't understand why they won't just do this for me, for my quality of life. There's some kind of moral code against it for some reason. They'll do it for a dog or a cat, but they won't do it for me. If it's not a thing I can convince them to do, I'll even consider saving to get it done elsewhere. I just want my life back. </TEXT>

The voice wasn't one that I recognized in any way. Later my dad told me that it was him who had been calling, and he had heard me talk, but it wasn't his voice on the phone.

It can't have been an echo of my actual voice. I am FTM but my voice isn't low enough yet to actually sound male. </TEXT>

Drawings are fine. Photos that don't show actual genital nudity, all good. It can literally be the same dude(s) in the same pose, clothing can be reduced down to an absolute minimum. But the moment you lose that one vital bit of coverage, it's an instant turn off.

I've never actually been in a relationship or any kind of sexual situation, so I have no idea how that would go. Am I broken or something? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have no issue with little changes that don't affect things in the long run, I actually get bored very easily and I need things to be moving around.

But whenever anything big might happen that could change things forever, I panic. The whole possibility just freaks me out.

I would love just one, big, positive change in my life, but all of the big changes in my life have been things like nearly dying, or finding out that I'm really ill in some way, or losing someone I care about. Very rarely does something good happen that affects my life long term. The only positive changes have been friends that I've made, and most of them have left in some massively destructive way.

I guess whenever a big change is coming up, I'm just so used to this being the way things go, I assume that nothing good could happen. I start overthinking everything that could make it into a horribly negative thing, or how nothing could change at all. I get myself stressed out over it. I feel like in a way it's a self fulfilling prophecy, I ruin every chance by panicking and ruining it myself or backing off from it. Maybe if there was just one, big positive change, I would believe that it was possible. Right now though, all I have is negatives piling up, and the small, insignificant positives getting buried underneath. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wanting to watch a TV show instead of listening to my brat brother screaming at the top of his voice THE ONE TIME I EVER SIT DOWNSTAIRS is some kind of awful atrocity that's the worst thing anyone could possibly do. The fact that I never sit downstairs for this exact reason only further supports this point, and the fact that I was sitting downstairs because said brat was having his entire room redecorated and it was loud is entirely irrelevant.

Nobody else in this house can do any wrong ever, they're all perfect. It's amazing to think that I somehow managed to live in the same house as all 3 of the only flawless human beings in existence. Anything bad EVER is my fault. I don't even have to have been there, simply my presence on this plane of existence causes everything that is wrong with the world.

My stepdad is a living god because he works, and nobody else on the planet works, only him. The fact that he works means that everyone on the planet owes him everything he desires, no matter how inconvenient to anyone or everyone else it is. The fact that I am disabled, ill, and struggling to find a job I could keep up with YET still paying rent to live in my own parents' house is yet again, irrelevant.

Is this how serial killers made? If I deserve credit for just ONE THING, it's that I'm not a serial killer yet. Just really, really stressed.  </TEXT>

Yeah, my leg is fucked. I get it. Yeah, it's cool when someone opens a door for me or something, but I don't need to be practically carried everywhere I go. My leg has been fucked for years, I know how to survive. I can deal with the simple pain of doing something that's slightly hard on my injury. I've probably felt more pain in the past few years than a lot of people feel in their entire lives, I can deal with some difficulty, hell I could probably kick your ass if I really felt like it. I am not weak, I am not fragile, and I appreciate the sentiment but please fucking stop.

This is why I wish I just had a robot leg or something. Nobody's going to look at a guy with a robot leg and think "hey, I bet he needs to be asked if he's okay every time he so much as looks at a set of stairs." hurry up and get it done already, science. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't been in a good place for a couple of weeks now, even. I'm constantly going between being tired all of the time and not being able to sleep at all, which were issues in the first place, but I never usually change between the two so often. I literally haven't been leaving the house, it's not like I've actually got anything to do anyway other than waste away alone in the house for 12 hours a day, until someone comes home and yells at me for something that I had nothing to do with before they go to bed.

People are even noticing that I haven't been out to get wasted lately, which is honestly what I normally do with my spare time. Of course it's only the guy who desperately tried to fuck up my only potential chance at a relationship who actually wants to hang out with me. That potential chance at a relationship is nowhere to be seen, I know his phone is broken so he can't text, but I asked him to call (I don't know what time of day he's free) so either he forgot that I exist completely or he can't call either.

I would go out, but I ended up investing the money I had saved in an Xbox One, I was originally saving it for my tattoo but I couldn't get anyone to design it for me. Other than my dog, Fallout 4 is pretty much my only friend right now. I might consider going tonight, but again, that asshole is probably going to be there and I'm going to end up having to act like we're friends and shit and if Aaron is there too, he'll try to stop us from interacting at all AGAIN.

Honestly I've lost every ounce of self respect right now so I might just go get drunk and dance with whatever other desperate pieces of shit like me I come across just to get my mind off of everything. </TEXT>

<TITLE> To be honest, my friend is such a dick </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-10 05:35:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I've been talking to this guy I'm really interested in for a while now. Nothing definite has been said, but every time we've hung out pretty much since we first met, we've been very close, dancing together, hugging when we're just chilling out, etc. This is pretty much the closest I've ever been to another human being to be honest.

I was worried that he wasn't talking to me anymore because he stopped texting me. So one night, I decided I'd just go out for the sake of it like I used to, and I decided to invite one of my friends along. We were talking for a while, and I mentioned the guy I had been hanging out with, and it turned out he'd asked this guy to meet him one time and he didn't want to go.

Not much later, the guy we were talking about turned up. It surprised me a little because he literally just ran up out of nowhere and hugged me. You could see the jealousy in my friend's eyes, and I felt kind of sorry for him. But yeah, it turned out that the guy's phone has been broken and he's been unable to text back, he even proved it.

Now, before I go on, you should know that though my friend isn't doing great in the dating department, but he's doing better than I am. Literally his only problem is that he just won't talk to people. He doesn't have anxiety or anything, it's just that his mum is kind of weird and has just turned him into the kind of person who won't do anything for himself.

Anyway, I spoke to him to make sure I wasn't making him feel shitty, because the last thing I want is to ruin a friendship over this. He said it was fine. As the night progressed though, he was getting seriously weird. He wouldn't let me and this guy out of his sight for one moment, and he was constantly trying to prevent me from getting close to him. Like, as soon as he started sitting next to me, my friend made us all move. If we ended up on the other side of the dance floor, he would get up as close to us as he possibly could. He made absolutely certain that we would never be alone together. On several occasions, if we were just chilling and this guy ended up really close to me and I put my arm around him, my friend would start leaning his head on him or trying to put his arm around him too. His mum started to call him asking where he was and to come home (it was approaching like 4am) and he REFUSED to leave. He even insisted on coming with us when we decided to go hang out at my best friend's (the guy's next door neighbour) house.

Now yeah, clearly I feel a little bit threatened. I mean, he looks decent and obviously I'm trans and he's not, which would make it way easier for him. That's not the main problem though. I spoke to him about this, I told him it was making me kind of uncomfortable, and he was just like "competition won't ruin a friendship". DUDE. You met him once a couple of months ago, I've spent over a month trying to cultivate a relationship with this guy. Just let it go, please let me have this one thing, just this once. </TEXT>

Most likely I'll just be stuck sitting at home feeling like a waste of space, wasting away and forgotten because my disability is bad enough to keep me from even working.

I miss having ambitions that I felt were possible to follow. Now the only hope I have is that all of these religious preachers are right and that somehow I'll magically get completely better, and complete my studies in some fantastically interesting career path.

<TITLE> My brother </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-01-05 00:08:28 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My brother is the most entitled, insufferable little heap of shit I have ever encountered. If you've ever seen those shows about problem children, he belongs there tenfold.

Now, this kid is 10 years old. He doesn't flush the toilet, doesn't clean up when he pees everywhere, he screams if anyone asks him to do the simplest thing. He cries, shouts and hits and throws things when he doesn't get his own way. If you're the one preventing him, he will hit you. You wouldn't think it would be possible to be scared of a kid, but if you've managed to piss him off in one of the many ways possible, you will be scared. He doesn't have limits, he will punch you, he will hit you with things, he will throw things at you.

This attitude runs so deep that he believes that he is genuinely entitled to everything. If he doesn't get something he wants, or someone disagrees with or criticizes him, suddenly "everyone hates him" and he throws a fit, usually ending in him attempting to storm out of the front door.

The other day, He genuinely told me that my life is easy because he hits his head on things in his room sometimes and he has to go to school. I have had a life destroying series of disabilities since I was 13. I can't walk without a crutch, I don't have the memory or stress coping abilities to study anymore, my sleep schedule is so thoroughly fucked that I spend half of the month unable to leave the house, and I'm regularly at the doctor's with more issues that need to be addressed.

I also get £400 a month disability money, since I can't currently work. I'm 19, this isn't a huge amount of money to me in any way. I pay my parents £200 board, in return I get my room, electricity, internet, and meals. An amazing deal. The other £250 goes towards anything I want to eat for breakfast, lunch or snacks, clothes, hygiene products,transport, any forms of entertainment I want, and supplies for the art that I'm attempting to make small amounts of money off of, fairly unsuccessfully, as well as whatever painkillers, heat pads and supports I need for my still deteriorating knees. So yeah, it's still not a lot when it comes down to it.

Of course, for this reason, my brother complains that I get so much more stuff than him, because occasionally I can afford to buy a new game or something. He demands to know why HE didn't get something nice when I did, along with all of the other nice things that my parents buy him to shut him up. If I buy myself food, I can't keep it in the fridge for more than a day, because he'll probably want it and my stepdad will give in and give it to him.

I just can't wait until I get to move out. I have no idea when that will be, hopefully sooner or later my disability money will go up to an amount of money I could live off of, but I doubt that, every time someone is sent here to assess me, they're constantly trying to find ways to bring the rate down. "Your arm isn't weak enough." "you can walk across the room, so you're not disabled anymore." I'm just pissed off with the whole thing. It's not like I'd probably be able to live on my own anyway, if I tripped and shattered my knee with nobody around I'd be fucked. I might end up in a state where I can't keep myself awake for more than 15 minutes at a time and end up not eating or drinking anything. I might fuck up my medication and have a seizure in my sleep. There's pretty much no escape from this place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I always fuck it up. The moment I come down from the optimism and back to reality, I immediately start to worry. Was it all in my head? I just feel embarrassed. Embarrassed because I tried when I knew I wasn't good enough. Embarrassed because I probably made myself look like an idiot to someone who I care about.

I've been worrying all week. What if it does work out? He's going to know that I have absolutely no experience with any of this stuff, he'd probably much prefer someone who does. I'm not like him, I can't just have anyone I want, so he means a lot to me, and it's going to hurt a lot if/when he brushes me off.

I need to just stop thinking and let whatever happens, happen. It's just so difficult. But if this doesn't work out, I don't think I'm going to try again. I can already tell for myself how much the constant rejection has damaged my ability to deal with this, maybe I'm just not cut out for putting my emotions in the hands of other people anymore.

I try too much, that's the problem. I get so invested in the possibility that maybe this person cares and actually wants to be around me, I try to prove to them that I'm worthwhile in any way that I can, so when I'm not good enough, it rips away another little piece of my self confidence. </TEXT>

<TITLE> A surprisingly pleasant night out </TITLE>
<DATE> 2016-12-11 15:37:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Note: I am a dude. If you think that I shouldn't be here because of my sexuality, then you should definitely just not reply to this. I've not had many problems with this on this sub, but there have been some.


I decided to go out last night in celebration of my time visiting the clinic in Nottingham nearly being over. I went on my own because nobody I knew was up for going out. I started off the night running into an old friend from a group I used to go to, we spoke for a while and caught up on stuff but he had to go early.
Fortunately while we were outside having a smoke, I recognized someone who I didn't expect to see again.
A month or so ago, I had met the most amazing guy at the same bar. His friend had forgotten her ID and couldn't get in, so he ended up hanging around with me the whole evening. I was sold instantly. He has the most amazing, friendly, fun personality, and he wasn't bad looking either. Unfortunately I lost him when the bar closed and we decided to head to a different one.
He was sitting with a group of friends on the table next to us, and he recognized me as well. We immediately started talking and I stuck with him the whole night. Initially his intentions were really hard to read, he's a great dancer and was dancing with a lot of guys, especially ones that looked lonely or out of place, but it was mostly just messing around and he would always come back to me. By the end of the night I had gotten up the courage to make my move by putting my arm around him while we were sitting off at the side, and he seemed totally up for it and we ended up spending the rest of the evening dancing together or just chilling out at the side hugging and stuff. I didn't get to kiss him because I didn't really find any opportunity, and I'm not sure whether he would have gone for it or not. I did manage to kiss him on the cheek, and he kept putting his head on my shoulder or moving my hair out of my face (I have weird, slightly longer hair that started getting in my eyes when the hairspray started wearing off)
I'm kind of nervous that I'm making more out of it than it was, there's still the thought in the back of my mind that maybe he was just messing around, but I'm trying not to be too optimistic or pessimistic. This is the most physical contact I have ever made with another human being, and to be honest it was pretty nice either way. We did exchange numbers, so hopefully we will meet again soon, and maybe it might even work out.

TL;DR: Awesome night, may or may not cease to be forever alone soon, it could still all go to shit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just hope that they don't come up with a bunch more hoops for me to jump through like last time. If they do, I'm going to kick off because I'm sick of this. Last time, they made me make the several hour trip to the clinic just to send me home with a new list of things I have to do, when I had done everything they had told me to. I'm really at the end of my patience with these people.

UPDATE: I didn't get T this time, because I have fatigue problems caused by Meningitis, and T thickens the blood and can also cause fatigue, so I just need to see a specialist in January or February just to make sure everything will be okay, and then I should get my prescription. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My best friend cannot keep up relationships for shit. It's always a matter of weeks until he starts some kind of drama with it and they and up hating each other (or, he hates the other person and they don't really give a shit) and yet he's got both men and women practically lining up to be next. I think the longest he's been single since he was 16 is about 3 months.

I'm basically getting to the point where everyone I know either is in a relationship or has been recently. I'm still here watching them enjoy themselves (or not, in the case of my best friend) with their significant others. Maybe if I didn't have the visual appeal of a 2 month old potato I would get to at least give it a try, maybe I could even be good at making someone else happy. But, I do. Or maybe my personality is just as shit and I'm an awful person, and it wouldn't work out anyway. I'll never know. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was considering getting a semicolon tattoo soon, but I'm not even sure I'm capable of not eventually killing myself yet.

I know there are people who have life worse, but I feel like life has just thrown all of the shit it can think of at me. I'm so far behind on my college work that it's pretty much impossible to catch up now, especially since stress is making me more and more ill by the day. If I fail this course, I somehow have to find a way to pay back over 7k, I'll never be able to get a loan for another course again so I'll never have any future in terms of careers, and I'm going to get kicked out. I can't afford my own place when that happens, and I can't get a job because nobody will hire me, because I have no experience, nobody to recommend me, anything. All of this is thanks to the fact that at the beginning of the college year, my entire digestive system decided to pretty much just stop working thanks to the damage caused by when I had meningoencephalitis.

I really cannot handle stress thanks to what happened, it will make me incredibly ill. If I wasn't on medication right now, I would be having seizures pretty much every time I fell asleep, that's how bad it is.

Of course I'm also really fucking ugly, and therefore incapable of getting into any kind of relationship like anyone my age can, and that means I am RIDICULOUSLY lonely. Sex isn't even a factor, I just want to be close to someone. However- that's not going to happen. The fact that I'm FtM makes that even worse, because of course it means that there's even less people who might put up with me. I might look and feel a bit better if I was actually even close to getting HRT, but my clinic is just finding more hoops for me to jump through every appointment, and all of this paperwork and shit is causing me.. guess what? MORE STRESS.

So in summary, I'm a hideous loser destined to fail completely at life, I can't be comfortable with a single thing about my own body and nobody who can help WILL help, my internal organs are getting ready to just quit again, and I'm about ready to follow their lead and tie a plastic bag over my head and go chill by a tree in the local forest. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get a fairly mixed bag of advice from people regarding my eternal search for a relationship. Some people say I should try my very best whenever possible- and others say I should stop trying and just let whatever happens, happen.

Currently I'm going by the trying really hard method. I try hard with my appearance, I try to meet new people as much as possible, I've joined pretty much every dating site I've come across, everything I can do, I have done. I usually try to initiate when I find someone attractive, but I also try not to act like I'm trying too hard because of course that will drive people off. Of course, none of this has even BEGUN to work.

On the other hand, I'm told that I should just do whatever I was doing anyway and apparently that's how normal people get into relationships?

Which one actually works/works best? People who aren't forever alone are more than welcome to let me know which one worked for you, it all helps. </TEXT>

I've had it for about a year now, and I typically wear sterling silver, silver plated or surgical steel jewelry, and I usually wear at least a small stud at all times prevent the piercing from closing up, since I have had piercings heal up very quickly when left open in the past.

I noticed that the piercing was itching a little, which I didn't consider anything unusual, but when I took out the piercing to rub my ear, I noticed that there was some blood. I dabbed it with some wet tissue paper, and it continued to bleed. From past experience I would consider this to be unusual for a piercing this old. It doesn't seem to be showing any other signs of infection, it isn't red or swollen, and hasn't continued to itch, and I haven't worn any particularly heavy jewelry in it within the past few days. Is this something I should worry about? </TEXT>

I would consider to be at least average intelligence, but academic settings just really don't suit me. I need to be doing something, and sitting at a desk all day writing about things just sinks me deeper and deeper into depression. I want to do something I enjoy, but I keep trying different things and none of them have been right. I'm studying medical science right now, and I was told that it would be more of a practical-based course, but it's all writing about the same boring crap all day every day. I can't change my mind again either, because my mum and stepdad will kick me out. I've tried to explain to my mum that I can't live even the next 2 years just dragging myself through life, hating every second of it but putting up with it anyway. She just tells me that that's how life is meant to be, and it's how everyone lives.

I'm just sick of hating my life, I'd rather not exist if this is all there is. I'm interested in art and have some skill, but I'd never be good enough to get anywhere with it. I have no idea what else I could do, I have a disability so I'm not great at heavy physical work, that's not what interests me either. I need to do something stimulating, not something that leaves me feeling like a zombie counting down the hours of every day.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> On my college course I've been having to wear my binder between 7 and 10 hours a day (At least an hour longer than is recommended per day) and it hurts so much. My ribs hurt, my shoulders hurt, my stomach feels like my internal organs are being squashed to a pulp. I had to leave the room today because I couldn't breathe, and I'm not sure how much longer I can deal with this.

Baggy clothing doesn't work because I have to carry a rucksack, which pulls any clothing into an... unhelpful shape. Top surgery isn't available anytime soon, the appointment I'm meant to be getting T at is next month but they said that they won't do anything unless I've gotten my name changed by deed poll, but I don't know where to find a solicitor to validate it or whatever, and just getting my first appointment took about 2 years so clearly they're not doing anything in a hurry...

I honestly don't know what I'm going to do because every time I leave the house it ends in so much pain, and if my ribs are too damaged they won't even do top surgery in the end anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven't been suicidal for ages, but now it's overhwelming. These kids think they're being harmless but.. they're not. I can't imagine continuing to live in a world where the thing that already makes my life a living hell is a complete joke.

Yeah, they say it doesn't harm me when they play pretend with pronouns and claim to deal with what I do when they have no fucking idea. They even call me transphobic when I point out that it's a problem. I have fought for my entire life for a goal I haven't even began to reach yet, while they're on the internet calling themselves "it" and claiming to be "demigender" or some shit and they have the fucking NERVE to seriously fight me when I well them it's harmful.

Society doesn't take me seriously anymore. They see me as one of these stupid kids. They see me as the joke that these people made me into. My struggle isn't serious to them anymore. People will actually REFUSE to refer to me as male because they think it's a game to me like it is to these spoilt little brats who haven't even begun to face such a huge problem in their entire lives.

Yet again, if I tell them this, I'M the bad guy. There's nothing I can do to convince them that what they're doing causes harm. They just want to insult me and tell me I'm a horrible person so they can keep on playing. Apparently gender dysphoria, the actual DEFINING TRAIT of being trans, isn't "required to be trans". It's just a meaningless label now. My fucking life struggles mean nothing. I can't shower comfortably, I can't look in a mirror or get dressed comfortably, because some 12 year old wants to feel special.

And I can't escape it. They're everywhere. They're everywhere and they won't shut up. There's more of them than there are people with the same problems as me now. They're louder than us, they're all people hear. They're ruining my life and I can't stand it anymore. </TEXT>

The weirdest thing about it though, is that it's only been picked up by anyone other than me once, and that was tonight. Tonight whoever it is has been calling over and over, it's currently 3am and the last call was only a few minutes ago. However, they usually only happen around the times that everyone else in the house is out, almost perfectly so. It NEVER happens after my stepdad (the first person to return) gets home, or before my mum leaves to take my brother to school in the morning. Other than that, it doesn't happen at any specific time, only within this frame of time, except for tonight. It could be a complete coincidence, but it hasn't even happened when everyone's been home at the weekends, or when my mum was home for most of the day one day.

There's no way for anyone I don't know to know this number, we never give out the number to salespeople, or anything of that nature, And I'm not some idiot who just gives out my home phone number on the internet. I know it's possible for the number to be called randomly, but why would they keep calling this number, and why is there no answer? And why would they make sure to hide the number?

The only reasonable explanation I can come up with is that it's a friend playing a prank, but most people I know have their number saved on the phone, and I'm not sure if you can hide your number in that case, plus it would be a pretty dedicated prank. Either way, there's not much I can do about it, just try to ignore it I guess. I don't know how I would go about blocking a number from calling, or if it's even possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Life is just so painfully awful that I'm about at my absolute limit. There's just so many things that I can't make any better. I'm incredibly facially ugly, which has had effects on my social life all throughout my life. I've never been in a relationship, and i have very few friends. I'm not fat and don't have had hygiene, my face is just ugly. To make matters worse, I'm also FtM and disabled, making my life just that little bit more difficult and making me hate myself just that bit more.

I just got kicked out of my volunteer work because my depression is stopping me from being physically able to drag myself outside, even though I'm on a high dose of antidepressants, and my mum and stepdad hate me. They think I'm useless, they tell me I'm lazy and I don't do anything. My brother hates me, he uses what they say about me against me, he loves to make my life hell.

I just can't do it anymore. Nothing is getting any better, I'm so lonely it hurts. Nobody has low enough standards for me, I hardly see what few friends I have anymore, and I don't get to go outside much because I have nowhere to go. My life for the past few weeks has just been sitting in my room trying to pass the time with things that can't even make me remotely happy or entertained anymore, getting shouted at if I dare leave my room, or even sometimes if I don't. I just have nothing to live for anymore, there's nothing I can improve, I have no willpower to keep trying things that have failed me so many times, like trying to go out to bars on my own. I'm not good enough for anyone in any way.

I don't want to fall asleep another night feeling so alone and hopeless, knowing that there's nobody in my life who can or will help me. I'm probably going to do it tomorrow. </TEXT>

The only advice people can give me with my appearance is to lose my piercings and lose weight from my face, but my piercings are pretty much the only thing I like about myself, and I'm going to have to do some serious work to get a thinner face, the only time I've ever lost face fat was when i lost absolutely every ounce of fat from the rest of my body first.

I'm planning to get a phoenix tattooed on my shoulder (symbolic of my transition and the ordeal I had with meningitis a few years ago) and a dragon climbing my arm as a sleeve, but I haven't started T yet, I'm still awaiting my final assessment appointment. I've found a good place to get the first of the two tattoos done, and I've started saving, but I don't want my tattoo to be ruined during the changed caused by hormones. If any guys here who have had tattoos before they started T could provide any help, that would be great. Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My last post actually got downvoted so I guess I didn't do so well..

First of all, I will clarify that I'm FtM, pre-op, and currently awaiting hormones. That means I'm a guy who unfortunately still has female junk, but I'm working on it.

I live in the West Midlands, and I like gaming (Mostly PC and Xbox360) I'm a fan of music and concerts, and I enjoy drawing and just generally creative stuff. I also like things like camping, kayaking, fishing, just the outdoors in general. I'm actually fairly outgoing (probably thanks to tons of meds) and I enjoy spending nights out.

I am however unfortunately disabled, I'm missing parts of my left knee joint and walk with a crutch, and have a left side weakness, as well as other minor damage left such as photophobia and memory issues.

I'd prefer someone as close to my own age as possible, but I'll avoid pickiness about that within reason. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My best friend... </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My best friend keeps telling me he's going to kill himself every time something goes wrong in his life (pretty much every few weeks). He just stars ranting at me about it on Facebook and if I don't reply pretty much immediately he starts going on about how I don't care and must want him to die and stuff. Like recently he's been dating some guy who's a few years younger than him (he's 19) and this guy told him he just wants to be friends, (even though their relationship is still weird and confusing..) and now he's telling me that he's going to kill himself. I can't deal with this shit, it's not like I don't have my own stuff to deal with. The only thing stopping me from still trying to do what he's threatening to do is the 40mg of Citalopram I take every day, which makes it practically impossible for me to even have negative thoughts anymore. I tried twice before, but I never did shit like this. I don't know how to deal with any of this anymore. I'm everyone's go-to person to complain about life to, but it's not like my shit is easy either. I work for FREE because my CV is too empty to get a real job, I'm a forever alone loser, and it's easy to forget that I attempted suicide twice before they started pumping me full of chemicals. Maybe it's the medication, but no matter how much my "employer" praises me for it, I swear my appearance of calmness is a fucking curse. It's like people forget that I actually HAVE feelings of my own. I just wish someone would just fucking understand for once, or even maybe care about my problems a little bit.

Sorry if I ranted off topic for a bit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently I've been using a dating site, and I started talking to a guy who has a great personality, he's really nice and everything, but.. I'm not physically attracted to him in the slightest. I feel like I don't really get to be picky in this situation, and I feel even worse because he's a recent cancer survivor, but I don't want to lead anyone on, I'm not an asshole.


I've also been talking to one guy who is incredibly attractive in my opinion, but he rarely replies to me anymore and I think he's stopped being interested, but he still talks sometimes so I don't really want to give up yet..

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not entirely sure where is a good place to start, so I'll just say whatever and hopefully get through everything.

I currently do volunteer work at a charity shop, I'm mostly just there to get my certificates in retail and customer service so I can get a real job, but I actually enjoy it quite a lot. I'm good at talking to people, especially when there's a decent conversation starter. I also see my fair share of weird and amusing stuff so I have lots of stories to come home with. Probably not the classiest of jobs, but I really enjoy working the till, and it's probably what I'll be doing for a while until things are stable enough for me to start on something more ambitious.

In my free time I enjoy gaming,  built my PC for exactly that purpose, and my Steam account seems to be the final resting place of most of my spare money. I also play on Xbox. I'm a big fan of survival games, horror games, and of course.. zombies. I'm always looking for someone to be my player 2.

I also enjoy art, I even made the slightly stupid decision of taking up a year of my life to get qualified in it. I made my closest friends there though, so I guess it turned out well. I'll pretty often just sit and quietly draw if I don't feel like doing anything else, but that doesn't mean that I'm not up for conversation at the same time.

I guess other than that you could probably say that I have a pretty strong sense of adventure. I love camping, sea fishing, climbing, hiking, kayaking.. I'd probably live out in the wilderness if I could. My sense of adventure also expands itself to food, I'm always up to try new food. I have some.. unusual.. tastes thanks to spending a lot of time in a mountain village in Austria, and I absolutely love venison, rabbit, hare, even ostrich (yes, we kept ostriches. They are assholes.)

In terms of appearance I'm fairly slim in build, probably around average. I'm 5'7, and I don't think my face looks too bad but that's up to you to decide.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So a year ago today, I was discharged from my CAHMS therapist and referred through to a Gender Identity Clinic. Since then I have received absolutely no contact from them apart from indirectly when they gave my doctor permission to prescribe me birth control pills to stop my monthly personal hell from happening. I've tried asking my doctor about what's going on, but they just said that they knew nothing and that there was nothing they could do.

I was wondering whether this was a normal length for a waiting time? I live in the UK, so the waiting times are likely to vary a little from the US, but this just doesn't seem normal to me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes I feel like still hoping something will work out is my biggest downfall in my situation. Each time it just kind of works out as




-Work up courage to talk to guy

-Things go well with guy for whole evening

-Arrange to keep in contact with guy

-Contact him later in the week

-No reply ever again/ get told he's not interested

-Be absolutely distraught for next couple of weeks because I'm a complete failure

-Get dragged to bar again by friends to cheer me up

-Rinse and repeat




The worst thing is that I've never been given any indication of what I'm doing wrong. I've tried doing things differently myself in hopes that I'll figure it out, but it always goes the exact same way. Everything is trial and error, but how am I meant to figure it out if I've never gotten it right once in my entire life? How can I know  if I'm even doing something wrong and that it's not just me as a person who's completely undateable? I really want to just give up and save myself from going through the whole process again, but I just can't stop myself from hoping that the next time it'll work out, even though the failure feels worse and worse every time. </TEXT>

It was pretty normal, and we stopped off at the usual supermarket around half way to get food and drinks for the rest of the journey. As we were in the section of the supermarket that keeps the sandwiches, snacks and small drinks, my dad said to me something along the lines of "wouldn't it be great if cherry Coke Zero existed". (he only drinks "non sugar" versions of drinks) It was pretty normal, I agreed, and we got on with what we were doing. Except only a few seconds later, guess what we found? I have never seen it since, and from my research, it doesn't exist, in this country at least.

<TEXT> Sometimes I just want someone to listen to what I feel bad about instead of telling me that i shouldn't feel bad about what I do, you know?

I've had issues for a long time with being seemingly unable to form any kind of romantic/sexual relationship. I'm 18 and nobody has ever shown any genuine interest of that kind towards me. Yes, I'm still pretty young, yes, there are other people experiencing the same thing. I fucking know that and I wish people would stop repeating those same things to me over and over as if it's going to suddenly make everything better. I've heard all of the advice, and followed all of it that wasn't completely stupid. I go out places. I talk to people. I make an effort with my appearance. I'm patient. None of that has been the problem, there is a genuine issue that none of this is fixing and everyone telling me that I'm clearly just overreacting or being pessimistic is only serving to slowly start to piss me off.

Maybe I'm hideous, maybe I'm not. Maybe absolutely no guy I've ever met wants to date a trans guy, or maybe that's not it. Either way I'm absolutely sick to death of people getting so stuck for advice to give me that it just gets more and more pointless and stupid, like the pure goldmine I got today "Maybe you just permanently pull an angry face". Really? REALLY?

I know they're just trying to help, but maybe sometimes I don't want whatever stupid advice they can scrape from the very bottom of their reserves, maybe I just want someone to listen to me for once without jumping in with something dismissive to say. Am I allowed to ask for just that much for once? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I was on my way home from college when I was stopped by a desperate looking guy just a little bit older than me in the street. He explained that he had stopped me because I had a crutch and might have some idea of what to do. He then proceeded to show me that he had a huge gaping wound on the side of his ankle/calf and explained that he had been attacked and mugged, and that since his money had been taken and he wasn't eligible for an ambulance (not bleeding to death and no broken bones) he had been looking for help for around an hour.

An hour. Asking people to help him, and even though he had a clearly horrific wound, nobody would help him.

Unfortunately I only had £5 left to my name and anyone I asked also refused to help, so I really hope he managed to get to the hospital. After this event it really hit me though, that before I came out as a trans guy ad started presenting as male, I had gotten immediate help for much lesser injuries. Yet nobody would help this poor guy and since then, I have also had a similar experience in which I spent over half an hour walking around with a clearly broken hand without any help.

If society really this biased? Will we really refuse to help men when they are clearly injured? Are people scared of a man asking for help, or do they just automatically assume that it's a lie or scam? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm at a point now where I just perpetually either feel shit about myself or just feel hopeless. The course I just started only serves to make me feel like shit in its own way, so this really isn't helping.

All I want is someone I can be specifically close to, sex isn't even that important anymore, I've been dealing without for long enough (ie forever). I want what I see everyone else have, even through all of the difficulties.

I actually don't know anyone who wasn't in a relationship by my age. Not even one person. In fact everyone I know who is old enough to have a relationship has been in one now. Clearly I'm not in a difficult place to start relationships. That only leaves me to be the problem.

My friends keep pushing stupid ideas like that everyone else is an asshole or something for not dating me but how am I meant to believe that? I have to actually earn it, and clearly I'm not doing that no matter how hard I try. I know I'm only 18 but I have zero relationship experience. I haven't even been in one of those test relationship that teenagers have, and there's absolutely no sign of anything changing any time soon. I just want to find a way to be good enough, but I have no idea what to do. I try my best to be a pleasant, sociable person, I take care of my appearance, what else can I do? Are some people just never good enough? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't even ask where I found this, but I can't share this on TIA. It is, however, absolutely hilarious if you can bring yourself to watch it, so I thought I should treat you to it. It also makes for a great discussion starter on the most commonly heard side of the vegan subculture- the crazy, militant ones that make every aspect of their lives about veganism.

<TEXT> I'm turning 18 in only a couple of months now, and I've never been in a relationship, never kissed, anything. Obviously it gets me down a bit, but until now I've never really thought of it being such a big deal and that it'll happen whenever, but now I'm wondering if it in itself will make it even more difficult in the future.

PS: I am gay, not sure if that makes any difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Someone needs to create some kind of drug that stops people from wanting relationships. I need it.

There is no way I will ever have a relationship. It's not like I'm an unattractive guy, I get a good portion of people admitting that they find me attractive. However they're usually either not my gender of preference, or they say this one same thing.

"I would date you if you weren't trans."

Every single time. Never been an exception. I have never been in a relationship, and nobody I've met has ever actually wanted one with me. I guess I understand the reasoning, but it's just so unfair that my chances are completely fucked for the rest of my life just because of the way I was born. There's never any "maybe when you're fully transitioned" or anything like that, I've even mentioned it to most of them and they still wouldn't be okay with it.

Most people might say "Oh well, it's not the end of the world!" but try actually being stuck with the fact that it's ridiculously unlikely that you could ever possibly have a relationship. Ever. Fall head over heels for someone? Well tough luck, they'll probably just go "Ew! You're trans! No." The chance that someone I like will ever be okay with it are next to zero. So no, it's not "the end of the world" but it's a massive hindrance to the quality of my life.

Oh, and the specifically designated dating sites don't work either. All I've ever attracted from those is people who want to call me a "cuntboy" and fetishise me for the very thing that makes me uncomfortable for every day of my life.  </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've noticed that recently TiA has been acquiring more of a "Haha, let's laugh at trans people!" attitude. We're all aware that genderspecials are a form of SJW and are there to be laughed at, but they're not an accurate representation of what trans people actually are.

Being actually trans doesn't make someone an SJW. It is an actual medical condition.

Even more though, I've noticed that TiA is attracting a large portion of people who seem to turn up just to go into a rant about how "trans people aren't real men/women". And they get upvoted. A lot. It's disappointing and honestly making me think about leaving the sub because it's not what TiA is meant to be about.

Thoughts?

Edit: I'll be posting proof here since a good portion of you seem to be completely unaware of your surroundings.

I've been talking to a guy I met on a site for just over a week and I told him I'm trans when I first met him and he said it was okay but the whole thing that I'm trying to get my prescription for testosterone came up and I explained to him and I don't think he's talking to me anymore. It was stupid to think I could have that and I don't even know why I did because I'm just disgusting and awful and everyone thinks I'm undateable as the default and I should just stop trying. I don't get to have that. I don't know why I let myself be so happy that I was talking to someone when I already knew it would turn out like this. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2014-08-13 01:25:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been through some shit. A brain disease, all of the disabilities it left me with, parental abuse, and sex dysphoria. I'm pretty lucky I've been alive for the past 3 and a half years,  but as much as I like to tell myself "Hey, you're doing well! After all of this you're still a normal person!", I am lying when I say it. I know I'm not doing as well as I like to think, but it's just really hard to accept.

I don't go outside much, I actively avoid it. I can spend months at a time without leaving a single room except for to eat, drink, wash and use the bathroom. I signed up for a college course for a while, I did well for about half of the year, but then my attendance dropped. I'm not being deliberately lazy, it just happens. When I'm at home, I can distract myself from my dysphoria by focusing on other things, but when I'm outside, I have to bind, which has already caused me a cracked rib once, and I'm still conscious about everything else. I'm also generally really bad at social interaction.

I can't read facial expression, hell, I can barely even tell people apart by face. Most of the time I can't tell if someone is laughing or crying. It makes all kinds of situations awkward. When I do manage to tell that someone is upset, I don't even know what to do. I feel like I have to force myself to care. I'm not good at expressing emotions either, most of the time I'm not even sure what I feel myself, or if I'm even feeling anything at all. The amount of times I've been called a sociopath is unbelievable, but I know I'm not. I WANT to care. I feel like if I could meet someone I wanted a relationship with I could learn to care like everyone else, but that's pretty unlikely considering my situation. I don't even know if I was always like this or if it's a result of my abuse, or even my brain disease. I can't really remember what it was like before my illness.

It's not just that either, I can't really speak to people anyway. I'm selectively mute. I have a few people I can talk to just fine, but if I try to talk to someone new, someone in public, someone in a shop, I can try all I want but no sound comes out, and I'm left smiling and nodding like an idiot. I'm terrified of talking to people anyway, I'm not sure whether those things are connected or not, so I tend to just not try. The selective muteness may be partly to do with my voice, after all I'm 17 and I both look and sound like a 13 year old due to the lack of testosterone going on.

I need to leave home soon, I'm near the limits of how much emotional and physical abuse I can take, and the fact that I accidentally punched someone in the face because they turned towards me quickly while holding a knife says the rest. I'm not even sure how I'm going to survive in society. I've not really been provided with much help. The only real therapy service I've been referred to brushed me off because I hadn't tried to kill myself yet (by now my attempt count is two) and I haven't managed to get another referral yet. I get a small amount of disability money, though not enough to live off of, because I have a left side weakness, but now I'm nearly able to walk without aid again I'm probably going to lose that soon. I'm not sure how I'll work, because I can't just smile and nod when my boss talks to me, or in an interview, and I don't really have the qualifications to do anything anyway.

So, yeah. I don't function in society. I guess I'm not really what people expect when they think of someone like that.  </TEXT>
