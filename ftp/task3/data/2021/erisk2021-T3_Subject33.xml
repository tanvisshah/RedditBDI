I once described my life as a "grimy, marginal existence" to my therapist and she got really sad - I could see it in her face for a few seconds before she composed herself back to neutral. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is....so true it's uncomfortable LMAO!

In my childhood and teen years I thought for sure I'd write books. I'd spend hours immersed in the stories in my head. Occasionally I'd attempt to write one down, but of course they never come out the same way. I went so far as to study English with creative writing in college. In my 29 years on this earth I have a grand total of one (1) poem and one (1) short story. (I have fragments of others but they're half finished/too embarrassing.) So I have two whole pieces of "creative writing" that I don't die of shame if someone asks to see them. I've recently come to the conclusion that I'm not really a writer. I just daydream my stories. Or daydream about being a writer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it's partly that I know I won't have the patience to help them work through issues/quirks (much like I wouldn't expect them to have patience with me, even if they say they do, which starts this whole cycle over again). I have extreme fear of relying on others because if you need help and they give it, then that's something they can hold over you and blackmail/manipulate you with.

I've also had some very bad experiences with "friends" who both couldn't set and can't respect boundaries. Those types of relationships always end badly, with resentment on both sides. So, I've got a huge wall built up for now because that just seems safest and most efficient. Dysfunctional, but serves a valuable purpose. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 29F, FA here....my strategies are extremely similar to what u/Kuwanz and u/si_vis_amari__ama describe.

Basically I go into "extreme panic and shut down" mode, which is confusing for the person interested in me because they think they did something wrong, and I feel pressured to reassure them that "it's not you, it's me, I just need to be alone for an unspecified amount of time."

If a partner/potential partner keeps trying to connect with me during this shutdown/panic phase, I lose all respect for them and start telling myself that they're full of red flags, they're controlling, they can't respect my space, etc. and then I usually just ghost them completely.

Breakups depend. The only relationship I was in, I dumped him (or more specifically, manipulated him into dumping me) after about two months because the stress was unbearable. I immediately regretted it, and we got back together after a few months apart. I wasn't really happy in the relationship, but I was afraid to break up with him again because of how crazy I'd acted before/during/after the last breakup. We were also a more established couple at this point so there was more at stake. He eventually ended things almost exactly four years to the day that we broke up the first time, and this time it was truly over, and I felt relieved and happy and relaxed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We're close in age, and so are our parents (I was born in 1991 and my parents were born early 50's) and I've thought this same exact thing in regards to the size 12 undies on JonBenet. I remember one time when I was about 4, my mom and grandma were away and my dad had to help me get ready for bed. I had to show him which drawer my pajamas were kept in, because he had no idea. And he was a very loving dad - he just usually worked night shift, had only one day off a week, and didn't usually look after me in the sense of feeding and clothing me.

I always think of that when I hear about JonBenet's too-large undergarments. It makes more sense that John would do that than Patsy, especially with Patsy's image-conscious personality. </TEXT>

I deal with this same thing with my mom, too. So very frustrating. She also goes through my mail and my dad's mail and she thinks that's perfectly okay. Boundaries are a foreign concept to her. One of my long-term goals is to go no contact (or very, very low contact with her). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, absolutely! I literally freeze up and I'll hide under furniture or something.

Once I was home alone, and someone started pounding on the door. I was half asleep on the couch and immediately ran upstairs. My dad was away on a trip that week and my first thought was "Oh no, they know my dad's away and they're coming to kill me" and I hid under my bed with 911 dialed in my phone, heart racing like crazy. After about five minutes, the knocking finally stopped and  I got up the courage to peek out the window - it was my mom's cousin driving away. We laugh about it now, but I was genuinely terrified at the time.

I've been like this most of my life, and this response intensified last year after we got some really bad news after a door knock (I saw the police car outside, but was about to get in the shower, and actually sort of forgot about it until a few hours later when my parents told me what had happened. And now my dad gets very tense and upset when someone knocks on the door.)

A doorbell ringing is not *quite* as bad as a knock, but still very stressful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Her life seems really sad. I saw her post where she talked about wanting to be a novelist and a high school English teacher but now she only writes about motherhood because it inspires her more than fiction ever could. Which, fine! I'm sure that does give inspiration. But how depressing that her entire identity revolves around being a wife and mother. There's no room for her anywhere, she doesn't seem to have anything that's just for herself. Of course she's a fundie, so my sympathy is very limited. But seeing her life makes reminds me of what mine could have turned into if I'd gotten married to a certain person, and I'm so glad I didn't! </TEXT>

You've described it perfectly! I experience this a lot. I feel intense anxiety and shame when I need to ask for help with something, no matter how trivial. It makes me feel like I'm burning through people's "budget of goodwill" towards me, which is probably meager to begin with, and that I'll become a nuisance that has overstayed my welcome.

I also feel incapable of helping anyone else with anything, and therefore I wouldn't be able to return the favor, so to speak. So I usually just keep my head down and struggle on alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! I can relate to this.

I thought I had a niece and nephew (twins), but it turns out they're not my late brother's children after all, and I can't even explain how relieved I was when I found out. This is because of a myriad of complicated reasons, but a big part of it is that I don't have to "phone it in" and pretend to care about these kids. The mother had also asked a while back if I wanted to be the godmother and now I don't have to do that either! I don't even know if she knows that I know my brother isn't their dad (I had long suspected it and today managed to get a screenshot of a comment she made which reveals the truth) but man, this is such a huge weight off my shoulders.

<TEXT> What, no black leggings worn with a North Face jacket and Ugg boots?!

Srs, definitely had an octopus necklace. Probably still lurking in a drawer somewhere. I had a mustache necklace too. Also had a tribal print shirt I wore twice before I realized I didn't like it. So many memories! I was in college 2009-2013. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I deal with this too. When my parents are out of the house, I feel so much more free. It's like a huge weight is lifted, and I have more energy for things. I'll set up a workspace at the kitchen table (if it's not too cluttered with my mom's stuff)  and even bake or cook things if I'm by myself - no one to walk by with rude comments or nosy questions.

I was just discussing with my therapist last week how uncomfortable I am in my own house, and my homework is to make note of the things I go out of my way to hide/cover up/don't do unless I'm alone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for sharing your experiences, and these articles! This has helped me figure out one of my own ambivalent friendships. She moved away so it's not an issue anymore, but I always wondered why we had the "ingredients" for friendship and yet it never really felt like a friendship. And I tend to fawn and people-please like it's my superpower - I can see how these tendencies make me susceptible to these types of relationships. My relationship with my mom is very much this way, too, and I think I unconsciously use her as a template of what to expect from other people, women in particular. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, the first time I remember actively wanting to die I was about 9 or 10. I wrote lists of ways to die, and "goodbye notes" and dark stories/poems in my journal. My grandmom, who was always going through my stuff, found this book one day and read the entires. She was reading it when I came home from school. I thought I was going to get in trouble, but she just kind of made light of it all. She showed me a poem she said she wrote that had dark humor about suicide. Later in college, I encountered the poem again, and realized it was Resume by Dorothy Parker (don't know why my grandmom lied and said she wrote it, lmao).

I was suicidal throughout most of my teens and sent to various counselors, etc. I used to lie to them and say I wasn't suicidal. I got really good at coming up with the "right" answers and feigning progress. My parents were always kind of blase about it, they would say things like "Everyone goes through this" and "It's teenage hormones." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I feel foolish and stupid when I wear dresses/skirts. I don't think I even own any dresses at the moment, and I'll only wear a skirt if it's really hot outside and I'd be uncomfortable otherwise. If I wear a skirt, or heels, or "feminine frills" of any kind, people make comments and I feel nervous and self conscious. Reminds me of when I'd get dressed up as a teen and my grandma would say to me "Who the hell do you think you are, you think you're sexy? You're just a show off!" This, combined with some very uncomfortable experiences with men, has made me very resistant to appearing feminine.

The irony is I have a huge collection of vintage jewelry, and I love soft cozy things, but it feels "dangerous" to wear those and accent my femininity. I stick with bland clothes and try to blend into the background. I hate attention of any kind.

ETA: Lockdown has been wonderful because I can spend lots of time at home, alone in my room, in my favorite sweatpants I've had for 15 years. My happy place :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ugh, yes, I have a coworker like this. I feel exhausted just by being around him. On top of what you described, he's also an insufferable know-it-all. He's always looking over people's shoulders to try and "help" (kryptonite for most HSPs!) and he has a bouncy ball that he's constantly bouncing. I can see it moving in my peripheral vision, and dear god it is so irritating!

I used to force myself to be friendly and talkative with him, but once we came back to work after a few months off due to COVID I gave myself permission to just not engage if I don't feel like it. I'm still polite, and will give short, vague answers if he asks me personal questions, but that's about it. I've noticed that the conversation will now just falter out on its own, and he'll find someone else to ~~annoy~~  talk to. And we still get along enough to fulfill work tasks.

This doesn't help with his overall loud, overbearing presence of course.... </TEXT>

I remember for prom, both of my parents went to work that day - they didn't tell me they were going to work that day, so it was totally unexpected. I felt so stupid and awkward when my friends arrived to pick me up and their parents wanted to take pictures and stuff, and they were asking me why my parents weren't there. I remember saying "They went to work" and they were shocked that they didn't want to be there for my prom, or even come home for a half hour or so to see me off.

This is so. damn. true. Anytime I (fearful-avoidant) feel guilty about setting/enforcing a boundary I remind myself of this fact. I wish this aspect of boundaries was talked about more. People who don't have their own boundaries definitely don't respect other people's boundaries.

<TEXT> My childhood has some similarities to yours. My house was also known as the "cool, fun, messy" house because there weren't any rules enforced and I was pretty much allowed to do whatever I wanted. My parents worked full time, 3PM-11PM shift, and my grandma lived with us. Grandma never enforced any structure or routine; she would get frustrated and angry but never made me actually do anything. She'd say "Well, I'm not your mother, I can't tell you what to do...." and just walk away. My brother, eleven years my senior, moved out to go into the army when he was 18 (I was 7) so I basically grew up like an only child.

Ahh, the Mountain Dew- reminds me of when my dad would get home from work and he'd let me sit up and drink soda and eat snacks with him and we'd watch TV (even if it was a school night).

I also had a lot of anxiety, and depression as well, to the point where I almost failed second grade because I missed so many days. My parents would basically say "What's there to be anxious about? You know we love you, you have a house to live in, others have it so much worse" which always just felt like empty comfort to me but I couldn't explain why.

Looking back, I can see a lot of this was emotional neglect, but I feel really guilty applying that to my parents. In my dad's case at least, it wasn't malicious. (Mom on the other hand....a different story). They were both workaholics in a struggling marriage, and just getting by day to day.

The closest anyone in my family has come to acknowledging any of this stuff was when my brother passed away last year>! (suicide)!< and my dad actually said to me, "You know, I should've been home more. I can see now how I wasn't fully present while you guys were growing up. I'm sorry." I told him not to worry, that it was okay, and I know he was just doing the best he could. I'd hate for him to feel bad about things. I do wish my mom would acknowledge some of her past behaviors.

Man, sorry for rambling -- just wanted to share, and show that I relate. </TEXT>

I remember with my boyfriend, with milestones such as meeting the family, my brain was screaming at me "It's a trap! You're getting sucked in! Run away while you still can!" Even though I already knew his parents - I'd been good friends with his sister in high school, and had spent time at their house.

The anxiety about being around his family never went away; I dreaded being around them. I felt so shy and stupid, and worried constantly that they were judging me negatively.

Don't know if other FAs relate to this, but I guess it comes down to I feel like I'm at the bottom of the "social food chain" and dating is a way of putting myself out there, potentially facing rejection or criticism from people and then ending up worse off than I was before. I feel as though I don't have enough "social real estate" to risk it, and I'd better just lie low and stay hidden and isolated to protect myself. Maybe it's a lizard brain thing combined with CPTSD and the avoidance. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I've (FA) even done this with friendships that fizzled out. It's hard not to keep checking. Depending on how "triggering" it is, sometimes I let myself just look and satisfy my curiosity. If it's a person who triggers me strongly though, I'll avoid looking and block them so they don't accidentally show up. Then years later when I feel like I've processed it all, I might unblock them and take a peek.

And of course today's world normalizes a lot of this stuff, so it's hard to know when it's "crossing the line," so to speak. </TEXT>

Obviously having a baby and then wanting your old life back, yeah, that's going to make someone really depressed. But I wish people would acknowledge that sometimes, people feel they made a mistake or they just kind of went with something that turned out to not be right for them. The sad thing with having kids is of course that you can't "undo it". </TEXT>

I can't believe I used to read books in one sitting (or at all, really) and write whole stories and stuff - the thought of attempting any kind of creative project seems completely impossible.

There's a website called "Does the dog die" that I use to screen movies before I watch them. You can look up any film and it will have a list of potentially triggering events and tell you if that content is in there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sending you support OP! You're not alone.

I've had a really hard time with hygiene and routines for most of my life. Slowly working on my habits but they take a lot of time to change. I started using a video on YouTube for a visual toothbrushing guide, and it's helped a lot - I don't get stains on my teeth anymore, which is something. Still have to actually get up and do it, but I have a bit more motivation knowing I have a visual guide to help me. Otherwise I space out and forget what I'm doing and just scrub the same area over and over again. Electric toothbrushes are great, too, if you're able to get one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Same here, my parents worked the 3PM-11PM shift and were asleep when I was getting ready for school. My grandma would wake me up but she never enforced any kind of hygiene/breakfast routine, she just hassled me to get out of the house so I could get the bus. I never had a bedtime routine either, so I was usually up really late, would oversleep the next morning, come home and sleep a few hours, and be up most of the night again. On weekends I would stay in my pajamas all day and just kind of wander around the house, reading, watching TV or playing on the computer.

I'm doing a little better with this as an adult, but it's a struggle. I feel like other people don't struggle as much with things like waking up around the same time each day, keeping up with hygiene, etc. </TEXT>

That video reminded me of the time when I was about 11 and  my mom told me I stunk, even though I'd literally just gotten out of the shower. My hair was still wet and I'd just gotten dressed. She said, "You smell bad and it's going to get worse unless you put on deodorant." Looking back I think she was trying make sure I started using deodorant on a daily basis, but she went about it in a very cruel, gaslight-y way.

I see what you mean about relating this to Jill -- if her energies had been focused elsewhere, I wonder what kind of person she might have been? Probably still would have had terrible beliefs, but if she'd had a passion or even a (gasp!) career, she wouldn't have had so many neglected, maladjusted kids.

Also, yes, hi fawning response! I know that technique well. I actually got nervous when Jill came in out of nowhere. I can imagine she's always hovering nearby, ready to jump in with criticism disguised as "helpful hints."

"We don't want to stink" Oh really Jill, well maybe if you didn't have so many freakin' kids and cram them into an RV everyone would be able to have a daily bath or shower! Cheap perfume isn't going to do the trick. This makes me so angry. These kids should have access to a normal amount of food and hot water. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I definitely relate to buying backups of palettes and things, and having one to use while the other one is untouched. I've done this since childhood with all sorts of things. The first time I remember doing it was with Lisa Frank Easter pencils in the late 90's (and I still have the unused ones, lmao). I have two copies of all my favorite books, one to read and one for "collecting" purposes (this is really stupid since I work at a library, lmao). Same with DVDs and CDs and makeup.

I'm trying to stop this, especially with perishable items like makeup. I cleaned out a lot of makeup during quarantine and it gives me anxiety when I realize how much money I wasted on things that basically got thrown away if they were expired, or given away. And I'm trying to keep in mind that we only get one life, and if we're constantly saving or hoarding things it takes the focus off the present moment and we sometimes miss out on something we were saving/preserving. </TEXT>

Picture 9: Is that a burn mark on her knuckle? Looks like a huge scab or something. Her fingers look weirdly enlarged in that photo. I thought they were her husband's hands at first, like he was standing behind her.

That kid's haircut....YIKES

All that peeling paint, both interior and exterior....DOUBLE YIKES

I'll begrudgingly admit that she is a decent photographer. At least better at taking pictures than she is at writing. I just hate how contrived and fake this all is. She must spend hours and hours on this BS and then tries to pass it off as "my real life, gosh we're just so twee and old fashioned"

<TEXT> Oh my gosh, this just brought back a memory of 7 year old me writing "MOM = DEATH" on the back of one of my pillows in permanent marker. Not long afterwards my mom saw it when she was stripping the bed to wash my sheets/pillowcases. I held my breath when she saw it but she never actually said anything about it, which in hindsight is really weird.

When I was 9 I wrote "God sucks and so does Grandma" on a post-it note. I left it inside my bedroom desk, because I knew my Grandma was snooping through my stuff. A few days later she came downstairs crying and waving the post-it around and I was like, "All this does is prove that you go through my desk when I'm not around." Afterwards, the only thing my mom asked was "Why does God suck?" And I tried to explain my rage towards God and existence in the best way I could as a 9 year old.

These things are both funny and sad in hindsight, lmao! </TEXT>

When they were getting married he insisted that his name had to be first on the wedding invites since he's the "man of the house." Made my skin crawl. (Fwiw, their wedding planner compromised and sent half with his name first, half with her name).

I feel like I'm better off "laying low" and flying under the radar. I don't do well with too much responsibility or pressure. I don't know where people get the energy and stamina to set ambitious goals and reach them! Everyone's talking about "grad school" and "fulfilling careers" and "retiring early" and I'm like.....uh.....well I made a dentist appointment and didn't cancel the day of, does that count?

If I get up on time, I'm keeping up with my hygiene, and and not buying too much random stuff on Ebay, I count it as a "win." </TEXT>

<TEXT> > Friendships require two people to be on even footing. As counterintuitive as it may sound, if you have no boundaries, setting them up will actually help you make stronger relationships because people want to be friends with fully independent individuals.

Thanks for this. I've also struggled with maintaining friendships; most of them feel one-sided after a while, like I'm just the other person's sidekick or something. I've been learning about boundaries lately too, and what you've said with this post is very illuminating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good questions! Yes, I do regret staying in it for so long, as all it did was waste my time and his time (especially his time, because he really wanted a relationship and eventual marriage, whereas I am perfectly content being single). If I'd have known at the beginning that it would go on for that long, it probably would've given me the courage to walk away. (When we first got together I thought we'd date maybe a year or two, tops).

I don't know if I would have regretted not contacting him after that first two week period. I think about that sometimes, because the intense longing I felt for him is a huge contrast to the "Okay bye have a nice life" energy I felt when we broke up for good 4 years later. I think because the second time around, it was his idea, it was a lot easier for me to accept. I've never felt confident in my decisions, and it's easier for me to go with what other people want. Not proud of that, but it's the truth, l0l. </TEXT>

And there are songs that I listen to frequently because they're beautiful and make me feel intensely, but they don't bring up sadness. Mandy Moore has an album called Silver Landings, and the deluxe edition has an acoustic version of her song called "When I Wasn't Watching." I'll always remember the first time I heard it -- chills, absolute chills. Her vocals are beautiful and so are the background singers' voices....the instruments....it's glorious. Brings tears to my eyes every time! </TEXT>

FA here, and yes! This is me also. I somehow ended up in a 4 year relationship that I knew from Day 1 would go nowhere but I felt powerless to end it. I did actually attempt to end it very early on, and it went poorly and I ended up contacting him two weeks later and we got back together, so I was afraid to end things a second time and make myself look even "crazier".

On the other hand, when it was his decision to end things after about 4 years together, I was so relieved. Those weeks after the breakup were some of the best of my life. I felt calm and balanced for the first time in a while, lmao! </TEXT>

She would tell me it's a "trashy fat girl's name" and that she wished I had been named something more feminine. When I started kindergarten she registered me with my birth name, but told all the teachers and staff to call me a different name. I went by that name most of the time until I changed schools in middle school and since then, I've gone by my real name, but it still doesn't feel like "me." Then again, the other name never felt like "me," either.

I'd like to change my entire name, but I'm worried I won't live up to the "image" I see for myself with that name and I'll get mad at myself (I know, it's weird, l0l)

I have seen reference staff get irritated when "interstate library loans" are returned late. In my system, these are books that were sent from an out-of-state library. So if it's late, the staff has to contact the library they got it from and explain what happened, not a fun conversation. If a patron returns an interstate library loan late more than once, they're prohibited from using that particular service for a while. Thankfully this rarely happens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. It feels dangerous to be happy about anything. And in order to achieve anything, we have to face all sorts of obstacles and hindrances. And of course it's so much easier to be destructive than it is to be creative.

My lack of motivation comes from entropy. Why bother doing much of anything when it will take massive effort to keep it going. Habits and routines are so easy to break. We make plans and the Universe laughs in our face and we're supposed to adapt as best we can? Screw that, I just want to stay in bed....

Edit: Also, things that are fun and enjoyable are usually terrible for us! Bad for our health, finances, or whatever. We can't even really express ourselves fully, for fear of retaliation and revenge. Humans just go along with fake smiles and forced politeness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh wow, I'm the same! Yeah it feels like the other adults are watching me interact with the children and judging me and making mental notes of what a bad influence I am. I feel so awkward and stupid around children. Especially precocious, talkative children that ask lots of personal questions. I can tell those types of kids don't really "respect" me as an adult.

I've been trained to work in the children's room at the library where I work, but thankfully I haven't had to actually do it much (we've been closed for a while due to covid). It was part of a promotion I got, otherwise I would have declined doing it. I'm still hopeful I can opt out somehow lmao </TEXT>

<TEXT> For what it's worth, I'm glad you're still here!

I think about this stuff a lot. I'm currently part-time and I've been wondering lately if full time might not be realistic for me, for so many reasons. My medical stuff and therapy is currently covered by Medicaid. If I went fulltime I wouldn't be eligible for Medicaid, and ironically I probably wouldn't be able to afford the copays (therapy in particular can be very expensive.) And if I was full time, I'd probably need the therapy even more than I already do now! And I'd have to go on Saturday mornings if I worked all day M-F, which I dislike having to do things on weekends because I need that time for rest.

Damned if I do, damned if I don't.... </TEXT>

I'm hoping the ferret was like "Ya'll suck" and ran off and found another home. Or put a new home with normal people on his ferret vision board and this moved Porgan's spirit (if they even have spirits, and not dust and sand where their hearts should be) to rehome the little fella.

Is that Paul in the second pic, with the leopard print hat? He looks really different there. Also I'm surprised such a biblical, masculine, manly man who mans would wear leopard print. Especially since they had to get the ferret a more manly vest (last pic). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can relate. Especially around certain family members I feel myself sort of regressing into a childlike state.

On paper I mostly look like an adult, but in practice I still feel like a young teen sort of trying to figure things out. I'm 29, have never moved out, and most "normal" adult things seem out of reach and unrealistic for me. I'm mostly okay with this, for example I enjoy being single and wouldn't want to live with a partner, so that doesn't bother me. I do wish I had more self-confidence and ambition, but growing up with dysfunction will kind of put that stuff on the back burner. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can relate to the OCD being both a strength and a downfall! It's definitely fueled some of my shopping sprees. The anxiety about "What happens if I don't get this item" is very real. I feel this real desperation to get something, and then it arrives and it sits on a shelf with all the other stuff I just "had to have" l0l. It's a struggle for sure!

I also love/hate how places like Ebay have a feature now where sellers can send you offers on an item you put in your watch list. I feel like this didn't happen as much in the past? But if someone sends me an offer, even though I know it's probably auto-generated most of the time, it makes it that much harder to resist buying the item! I'm such a sucker for the most obvious tactics.

<TEXT> This is interesting!

My mom told me a while back that when I was a baby and toddler, I was extremely quiet, rarely cried or made noise, and didn't react to a lot of things. She says, "I'd put you in front of the TV to watch a children's show and you'd just stare at the ceiling or look at your hands." It got to the point where she thought something was wrong with me, and had me tested for different things. The doctor apparently said I was fine, I just needed more interaction. Which.....yeah, my mom was never the most engaging person. Even now, she ignores me and just stares at her phone (I'm 29 now).

My grandma who lived with us would ignore me if she was angry with me. I can still picture her sitting on the couch, turning her face away from me if I tried to talk to her or simply staring straight ahead at the TV (if she was really, *really* mad she would sit in a darkened room with her arms folded).

I've noticed I like the fact that masks are required in public, and I feel calmer when I can't see as much of people's faces. I never realized how "overstimulating" it was for me to see people's whole faces and their expressions, if that makes sense? I like the cover-up of the mask, I only have to see their forehead and eyes. I think it's because there's less information/stimulation for my anxious, hypervigilant brain to deal with. I wonder if this has something to do with what my mom and grandma were like when I was a child. </TEXT>

We recently started offering free print jobs, up to 10 pages. I feel so bad for the reference staff that have to deal with that.

<TEXT> This is something I've thought about a great deal. I'm similar to you, I deal with very intense social anxiety and the forward facing nature of library work can be very intense at times. Lately I've been less anxious at work, as we've only been doing curbside pickup for items.

My personality is one of the reasons why I personally decided to not go to grad school for librarianship. (The other factor is the cost. There is a scholarship available in my state but I don't know if I could meet all the requirements.) I see what some of my coworkers and supervisors deal with, and while I'm sure it's very rewarding, I just can't see myself doing it. I'm too non-confrontational and I wouldn't enjoy planning/coordinating programming and other patron-heavy types of things.

I would enjoy a behind the scenes library job doing things you mentioned (cataloging and records, etc) but I don't know how many of those are available in my area.

That said, I wouldn't discourage you from pursuing it if it's what you really want! If you have a passion for it you'd probably be successful even if there were uncomfortable aspects. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a good question. I have stopped myself from looking at certain people's profiles if they trigger me a lot or they treated me really poorly. Thankfully there haven't been many of these types. The one I remember most clearly was a narcissistic and toxic "friend" in college who wanted to date me. There's varying degrees of success with the "just don't look" method.

Oddly, I seem so much more comfortable with just creeping. If they actually wanted to talk, hang out, and get to know me in real life, I'd totally panic.

Another reason I like the voyeurism is that I feel people are more authentically themselves online, more relaxed and open. If you're on a first date with someone both parties are on their "best behavior" and it's hard to gauge what someone is really like.

Someone else mentioned that looking at their social media, etc. fuels the fantasy of what might be or could have been with a person, and that it's so much safer and happier, whereas an actual relationship would be really scary. I find that this is absolutely true for me, as well. I'm also a maladaptive daydreamer (basically addicted to daydreaming and my world inside my head) and I get good material for internal storylines through looking at my crush's Instagram. Again, I know how weird that must sound, LOL!

For me, the indirect contact is absolutely easier to handle than a "real life" relationship of any kind. This has been a pattern for me since my teen years, when Myspace was a big thing. I'd rather read and observe than interact. I know how creepy that must sound. Even close friendships are too much for me at this point, let alone dating. </TEXT>

Creepy and dead-eyed as her hubby is, I'm kind of worried for her safety if he doesn't know about this and finds out. Hopefully they're all just living out their kinks consensually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! One of many reasons I dislike driving. I hate when I'm waiting to turn and have to yield to oncoming traffic and the person behind me starts honking, and I KNOW they can't see the road as well as I can. Drives me crazy! I've started turning my music up at yield signs so I won't hear them if they do honk.

I've even had people honk at me in drive-thrus, which makes no sense? Like I'm waiting for my food, not leaving until I get it, wait your turn! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I have a hard time with this as well. I frequently have "anger attacks" or intense flashbacks where I get really angry, enraged even, about things that happened a long time ago. My heart will race and I get sweaty and wound up. When this is happening I'm like, Where was this anger when I needed it? When I could have used it to protect myself, or set and enforce a boundary? In the moment I'm just a pathetic simpering people pleasing fawn type.

I've tried to think of responses to use when someone crosses me, but it's impossible to think of stock phrases for every hypothetical conversation that might happen, and only enhances the anxiety I feel when I'm with others.

I guess the delayed anger might be my old way of protecting myself, since I'm so used to hiding my feelings and just "going along to get along". My caregivers reacted poorly when I showed emotions as a child.

 I'm hoping I can get better at expressing myself in the moment but it's hard, I'm so disconnected from myself most of the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! My experiences have been very similar. I'm 29 now and I'm always surprised when I figure out how to do a "Life Task" and usually, they're far simpler than I thought they would be. My parents always build everything up like it's some huge impossible thing that I'll never be able to grasp so they just take care of it.

> I'm personally self-conscious to bring up with others. I don't tell my friends about my parents' behavior anymore because to them it just sounds like I have fabulous parents who are bending over backward to help me. I end up feelings nuts and ungrateful. They don't understand my parents' behavior comes with a design to control and manipulate me.

Same here! I'm really embarrassed of my lifestyle because my parents still do so much for me, not because I ask but they assume I'll screw it up. So I've become really isolated because I don't want people to find out what my life is really like. And if I ever push back on my parents doing these things for me, they act puzzled and say things like "You should be grateful! I wish my parents had done these things for me!" And it's like....okay....but this all feels very smothering and controlling.... </TEXT>

I'm worried that if I start talking about it though I'll laugh and make jokes like I do with serious things and I'll unintentionally make it sound "lighter" than it was when really, that was such a horrid time overall in my life.

<TEXT> FA here and I experience the same. If I want cuddles or affection, I go about getting them in a "sneaky" way. In my last relationship, I would never say out loud that I wanted physical affection/cuddles, but I'd curl up next to him and reposition myself until he put his arm around me. (Hard to describe in writing). Well, I *thought* I was being sneaky about it, but one day he said "Wow, you're in one of your really affectionate moods today." He was a super snuggly AA so he never had an issue with it (if anything he probably wished I was like that all the time).

I have memories of being a child and feeling worried/upset about something but afraid to tell my parents or grandma how I was feeling, so I'd sit next to them on the couch instead and try to discreetly snuggle (i. e., sit closer to them than I usually would and hope they'd put their arm around me or offer a blanket.) I was afraid to tell them my feelings, because they got frustrated with me if I was having difficult emotions. So I'd keep silent about it but still try to get the comfort I needed. "Covert cuddles" or "sneaky snuggles" you could call them, LOL.

Same thing goes for other needs and desires (hunger, feeling tired and needing rest, wanting to see a certain film, etc). I'm 29 now and I can't seem to be able to express needs and wants clearly, I feel like I have to sneak around and do it "between the lines" or something.

<TEXT> This is so relatable....29F here, was in a relationship for four years and it was exhausting. We never lived together but I hated the loss of my free time and privacy. He wanted to spend as much time together as possible and a couple of times showed up to my house unannounced....which I will never understand why someone would do that to an introvert?!? I tried to explain to him why that bothered me and he just didn't get it. He was also very into the oversharing stuff, posting every little detail on FB, etc.

He was a good guy for the most part but I was relieved when it ended. I could feel my life coming back into balance and my head was clearer. I just seem to function better when I'm single. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can relate to a great deal of this. People get "fake" versions of myself and then I get panicky when it looks like they might figure out that I'm actually bored and uncomfortable around them most of the time. Lately I've been isolating myself socially until I can figure out how to reduce this tendency in myself.

The 4 year relationship I was in - we never slept together because of his religious beliefs, but we'd have phone sex and stuff. I have little to no interest in sex so I really "phoned it in" (pun intended, lmao) and one time he told me he was intimidated by me sexually. The irony! We eventually broke up for unrelated reasons. Looking back we never should have dated in the first place, we had totally different beliefs and priorities. Then again, I told him all this at the beginning, and he seemed to disregard it until it came around to bite us in the ass four years later.

I had an acquaintance I used to meet up with at cafes to work on writing projects. I hadn't written anything in a long time and ended up just fooling around on my laptop during these sessions, without working on anything at all. I even had a fake Word document that looked like it could be a writing project and I'd switch to that screen if she was walking behind me to use the restroom or something. I never got the courage to tell her that I'd realized I didn't want to be a "writer" anymore. Eventually she moved and we don't meet up anymore and it's such a relief lmao </TEXT>

<TEXT> So very true. I get sucked into these things every now and then, and ultimately end up feeling totally frustrated and invalidated. The whole "no judgement" thing and the "you are responsible for the way you feel" thing has really screwed me up, because I already have an extremely difficult time setting up and enforcing basic boundaries. So the times in my life where I tried to adhere to these things I ended up allowing toxic people into my life and feeling powerless to do anything about it.

The whole ego thing messes with me too - at times I feel so disenfranchised that I think it'd be nice to have a stronger ego/sense of self, because then I might feel like I have some footing in the world and I wouldn't be so afraid to take up space!

Great post, and thank you for bringing attention to this phenomenon! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I relate so much to most of your post. I've only been in one "real" romantic relationship and the only reason we ended up together was because he told me his feelings for me and I kind of just went with it (after a few months of panic and anxiety and protests on my part about why I would waste his time, and after a while he just started calling me his girlfriend anyway.) I also spend most of my free time alone in my room, and am very emotional but others  wouldn't guess that about me. Even the romance in the household thing - yup, same here, my parents are married but have always seemed to have separate lives. They're more like roommates than anything. This seems like enough for them, so I think that's where I got the idea that romance just isn't important or necessary in life.

I could go on and on about all the similarities (Omg the ghosting! That's my specialty!) but I've already rambled quite a bit, l0l. I personally am a fearful avoidant.

I don't want to "diagnose you" with anything as I am merely a stranger on the internet, and I'm no expert. But I'll give you a link to a test that may help you confirm your attachment style.  [https://www.idrlabs.com/smart-attachment/test.php](https://www.idrlabs.com/smart-attachment/test.php)

<TEXT> I've been coming to a similar realization myself. For a long time I've tried to force myself into a strict budgeting/minimalism existence, but as the years go by I'm starting to realize that it's just not who I am.

Ironically, once I started accepting this, my shopping urges decreased quite a bit. That, combined with quarantine and less stress from work, and I've been doing really well. I treat myself to a couple of thing every payday and maybe a cheap thrill or two throughout the week. I still have way too much stuff, and I think my shopping is something I'm always going to have to keep an eye on, but overall, I think I just need to accept that I'm a person who likes to shop.

I agree with you on thrifting -- I've tried that off and on but like you said, something always needs mending, or there's a weird stain that won't come out, etc.

I guess it's a mindset thing? To quote Hank Hill, "Fun, within prescribed limits." I reduced the extreme guilt and fear and shame I was feeling about my shopping habits, and actually ended up spending less. </TEXT>

As far as high school crushes/"boyfriends".....no. Last time I did that was maybe the first couple years of college when I was still in touch with people from high school.

And in Girl Defined's case, they never even dated, so it's weird to see they're invested enough to write this judgy blog post about it. Like why even put that out there? What if the people you're writing about come across it? Lmao.... </TEXT>

One thing I've always wondered about is in the first book, when Harry/Ron/Hermione lose all those points for Gryffindor and everyone gets angry and ignores them completely. I remember a sentence like "The Quidditch team never spoke to Harry directly, referring to him as the seeker if they had to mention him" or something like that.

<TEXT> Yeah, my grandma used to go on really long monologues about how much harder her life had been, that I should be more grateful, that I was a brat, on and on and on.

My mom used to do a similar thing. (In fact, she still does it sometimes). She'd say things like "I don't get it! I knock myself out doing things for you and I buy you whatever you want and you act like this! Meanwhile there's drug addicts out there who can't even be with their families and their kids worship them! Where did I go wrong to end up with you!"

So I ended up having an "aversion" to gratitude because it instilled fear and anxiety in me. I'd thank a friend over and over again for buying me a soda or something, and they'd be like, "It's okay, you don't have to keep thanking me!" When I was about 17 I read The Secret (lmao) and of course it described the benefits of gratitude. So I started making gratitude lists, which turned into obsessive rituals. Eventually I stopped because it always had shades of guilt and anxiety attached to it.

Nowadays I mentally acknowledge the things I appreciate, (verbally if it involves another person) and make an occasional journal entry. But I've made an effort to stop berating myself for not feeling "happy and grateful" all the time. I can enjoy the good things in my life, and still have unprocessed trauma and CTPSD I'm dealing with. I visualize it as two different trains running on separate tracks. </TEXT>

Having said that, I can totally see your point about this album being one where she chases trends instead of creating them. It might be the "least Madonna-ish" album in that regard.

<TEXT> Yes, I can feel rage coursing through my veins and I get overwhelmed. This usually (but not always) happens hours or days after the offense occurred, though, so I seem to have delayed reactions to things. Probably because I wasn't allowed to have many boundaries growing up, and my feelings were rarely validated or respected.

In a rare instance of immediate anger, at work one time I had to tell a teen girl to either end her phone call or take it to the lobby (it's a library setting) and she said "sUrE" in a very sarcastic tone and then kept right on talking as soon as I walked away. Oh, man, that pissed me off BIG TIME. Her tone of voice and overall dismissive, snotty attitude reminded me so much of my mom. My rage was so intense I actually decided to get another staff member to speak to her because I didn't trust myself to handle it in a civil manner. And of course the teen obeyed the other staff member. The whole rest of the day I was basically in a tailspin of *No one respects me, I'm stupid, I'm ineffectual, I'm a fraud, I'm sick and tired of being disrespected....*

<TEXT> Yes, I'm 29 and I worry that I've wasted so much time. Seems like just yesterday I was 20, feeling intense regret over my wasted childhood and teen years, determined to make my 20's "my decade."

I had good chances to do it, but got distracted with stupid things (a dead-end relationship I didn't really want in the first place, a shopping addiction and poor financial habits, etc). I wanted my 20's to be a time of self-improvement and learning things but I'm scared that I haven't made much progress. I'm still basically at step one, teaching myself basic life skills and trying to apply them.

Seems like a lot of the regret is about things I did because of my deeply rooted people-pleasing tendencies. Everyone experiences peer pressure, but I seem particularly susceptible due to my lack of boundaries and identity.

Since learning about CPTSD, I feel like at least I have better understanding as to why I kept falling into those self-destructive patterns. It's like a missing "puzzle piece" so to speak. So, here's hoping my 30s will be a time of healing and personal growth. </TEXT>

I wasted 4 years in a relationship with someone I really wasn't even all that interested in, we used to go to church and I found myself sort of pretending to be a Christian. There were other things too that I took on as a "false self" and then as soon as we broke up I was so relieved because there were so many things I didn't have to bother with anymore.

It's wild how deeply ingrained the people-pleasing response can be!

I wonder if now she feels like she's "over the hill" in a way, and that she has no more milestones to look forward to? It would explain the fixation on her courtship/wedding day.

<TEXT> Interesting question. I had frequent stomachaches/digestive issues as a child all through high school. My parents would get pretty annoyed and exasperated because no one could figure out why I had these issues. I assumed I had IBS.

It wasn't until my sophomore year of college, age 19, that I found out I have Celiac disease. This explained so much about my health issues. When I told my parents they said, "Oh, so there is actually something wrong? We really thought you were just making it up all the time." That was so upsetting and invalidating.

I learned very quickly as a child to hide and repress my feelings, especially if I was sad/scared/anxious because the caregivers around me would get annoyed and angry. So I spent a lot of time trying to hide the fact I wasn't feeling well (varying degrees of success) and covering up and repressing emotions.

I can see where a lot of this contributed to me being FA. I am terrified to be seen as a "burden" to others and to express any kinds of needs or wants. I am a chronic people pleaser and feel that I must be "fine" at all times or it will create problems. As a result I avoid any kind of intimacy because being close to others is exhausting and I can't maintain the façade all the time. </TEXT>

He was like, "Oh....well you look good in shorts, you should shave your legs and wear them more often!" which my brain immediately turned into *See! He doesn't like you for you, he just likes you for how you look. He doesn't actually care about you.* And this I really believed. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Extreme self-deprecation to reduce intimacy/make others leave </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-07-07 10:08:47 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all, 29F here with a fearful-avoidant attachment style. Something I've noticed I do if I feel like someone is interested romantically in me, I'll say really self deprecating and hateful things about myself in an effort to convince them why they shouldn't go out with me.

This happened with my last relationship, where after he told me his feelings for me and asked me to be his girlfriend, I immediately when into Extreme Panic Mode **™**  and short-circuited a little, telling him I was "crazy, weird, stupid, maladjusted, and I'll just ruin your life and hold you back." It didn't work, he just went into overdrive trying to convince me otherwise and telling me that I'm a nice girl, etc....

 It's important to note that *I don't even fully 100% believe* the cruel things I say about myself in these moments, it's like a last-ditch effort to make someone not want to stick around so I won't have to deal with increased intimacy. It's like a skunk spraying to make others leave on their own volition, LOL.

Do other FAs do something like this? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can relate to so much of your post, my childhood was very similar. I never had to do chores, had an abundance of gifts and things given to me, etc. But my main way of relating to people is to freeze and fawn. Assertiveness is a foreign concept to me. I've tried to learn it and apply it to my life, but in real life it just seems impossible. Slowly working on that (and other things) with a therapist.

I turned 29 this year and I still feel like a teenager. Sort of directionless and powerless. I get super frustrated with my parents (I still live at home) because they tease me for not knowing how to do anything, but at the same time, they still prevent me from trying anything. It's a very weird dynamic, and feels weirder still to acknowledge that this is indeed a form of trauma.

Here's to our continued learning and healing! <3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do this sometimes. Looking back I can see that it's usually a delayed realization or perception that the other person is using me or taking advantage of me in some way, or that I feel drained after spending time with them. I get frustrated that it took me so long to realize it, and cutting them off suddenly seems like the best way to atone for the time I "wasted" with them.

As I've gotten older I've gotten better at noticing subtle signs that a person is probably going to irritate me, and I can enforce better boundaries. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can relate to this! For years I've wondered if I'm asexual and aromantic, I think on a spectrum I definitely lean towards those things.

I have a fearful-avoidant attachment style, most likely as a result of the emotional neglect I experienced in childhood, so it might be because of that.

It's very difficult for me to integrate sexuality and romance into my self-concept. When I've participated in these things in the past, it always felt like I was being fake, inauthentic, and not true to myself, like I was just acting out things other people did without really feeling anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As soon as I pushed him away I regretted it intensely and missed him. I held out on contacting him for about a month, and then texted him telling him how I was feeling. He acknowledged it kindly, but didn't send anything else, and I figured it was over and tried to let go. About three weeks after I sent that text, he started texting me. I wanted to answer but I was so caught up in anxiety and stress and embarrassment. I felt like I'd acted really crazy and stupid with him and felt ashamed.

I emailed him because I did really want to talk to him, and felt that email was less immediate than text.

Honestly, I hate the game. The push/pull was absolutely torturous. So much turmoil, and inner strife, self-doubt, cognitive dissonance, confusion, etc. When I was with this guy I didn't know about attachment theory, so I didn't know the reasons for why I felt like this. All I knew was I had promised myself I would never date or get too close to anyone but I did really like him and wanted to make an exception, but was scared of the consequences.

I know that all sounds really intense. I hate that I'm like that. Wish I could just relax a bit with people. It's gotten better now that I know why I'm like that. Awareness helps a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> \[TL;DR at bottom\]

Good question.....so my last boyfriend, we were together 4 years. I pushed him away after the first two months, and we didn't talk for three months, then got back together. This was mostly due to persistence and patience on his part. He would text me every week for a few months and I never answered, but I did miss him a lot, and finally I emailed him and that's how we got back in touch and started dating again. When he ended things four years later, it was because we both finally realized and accepted that we want completely different things in life.

I very, very rarely go out on dates. Last one was in March 2019 with a guy that comes into my workplace. We'd always flirted pretty heavily and I thought there was a lot of chemistry there, but the date was so boring. Very nice guy, but absolutely nothing to talk about and nothing in common, different lifestyles. I lost interest immediately and stopped answering his texts.

A week after that a guy I like at work asked if I wanted to get food after work, and I wanted to but I was still so "wound up" and coming down from anxiety from the date the week before that I didn't want to go through the stress again and I panicked and lied and made an excuse. (It's important to note that he may not have thought of this as a "date" but it's unusual for him to socialize with coworkers). I felt so elated and giddy and flattered but also the usual terror and anxiety, LOL.

TL;DR: Relationships and dates are pretty nonexistent for me at this point in my life, but the relationship I was in lasted so long mostly because he was doing all the "heavy lifting" (I think he was secure with anxious tendencies). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've thought about this dynamic a lot recently. My mom is very overbearing and smothering, but at the same time, cold and distant. She's always sticking her nose in and "taking over" when it's really not necessary, but with things I actually need help with she turns away.

I'm 29 and still live at home and am a maladjusted adult in many ways. I take responsibility for this, but looking back over my upbringing I can see where it happened. My mom has always acted like there's something wrong with me, and that I can't handle most things. For example,  in the past I've applied for full-time jobs. She'd ask what kind of job it was and then dismiss it immediately, saying things like "Oh, you wouldn't be able to handle that, you're not going to be able to work in an office with a bunch of bitchy women. Find something more suitable." And then the next day screech at me for being "lazy and unmotivated" and I'm like "Well damn, any time I try to do something new you shut it down so what the hell."

She was also desperate for me to attend college, but refused to help with any of the application process, taking the SATs, the financial aspect, etc. She expected my dad and I to figure all that out. Then she criticized me the whole time for "wasting time being an English major" because that's "useless and stupid and nothing more than an expensive book club."

At this point I don't tell her much, if anything about my life. She still works full time so I'm able to conceal things from her pretty easily.

This is definitely a strange dynamic! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep! My mom will frequently go on long tangents about how her mom beat her, and often for no reason. And her mom (my grandma) was beaten a lot in childhood, often with things like horsewhips. So it seems there's a generational pattern of abuse.

My mom's physical abuse to me was pretty infrequent but when it did happen, it was intense. If I tried to talk about it later, she'd just laugh it off as "Oh, please! That's nothing compared to what I went through....you should be glad I didn't let Grandma do it instead....you never listen to me anyway and you deserved it...."

And of course the concept of emotional neglect and abuse is scoffed at. Makes it very hard to explain how and why she's hurt me over the years, although at this point I've given up trying to make her understand. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm this way, too. As a small child I *hated* turtlenecks, and in high school one time I had to leave early because I had a massive panic attack while wearing one. I remember being in the bathroom in the nurse's office, yanking it off and breathing/shaking heavily while the nurse was trying to talk to me from the other side of the door.

I also hate skinny jeans and leggings and any kind of tight clothes like that.

Oddly enough, I love wearing scarves? I think it's because they're usually pretty loose and they can be removed easily. Having the layer of a scarf feels like a cozy little security blanket sometimes.

Edit: Added detail about scarves </TEXT>

<TEXT> Many, many times! I used to think I wanted to be a writer. I studied English in college with a creative writing concentration. It wasn't until a few years ago that I realized I just like daydreaming stories, not actually writing because to make a written story make sense you have to deal with plot holes and stuff like that. LOL. "Being a writer" had been such a huge part of my identity up until that point (I had just turned 26) that it was a really weird feeling to realize that it's not really who I am.

I have maybe...2 finished short stories? And they were part of assignments in college, not projects I completed on my own volition. All my other "material" is just notebooks filled with rambling, mixed up stuff that wouldn't make sense to anyone.

I just stick to daydreaming now, with an occasional journal entry if I really feel inspired by a song or movie or something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> \[TL; DR at the bottom! It's 4AM and I got rambly, l0l\]

Reading your post, I saw a lot of similarities with my own life, and my relationships with my mom and grandma. They are (were in Grandma's case, she died a few years ago) *extremely* critical of me and disrespectful of my privacy and boundaries. My mom will go through my room sometimes while I'm at work and try to get rid of things. I like to do my own laundry, but never when she's at home because she'll go through it and secretly throw away things she feels are "ugly" or "worn out", like she thinks I won't notice?? Then I have to sneak out to the garbage and rescue my clothes so I can re-wash them. Really passive aggressive, controlling stuff like that. It's infuriating.

She is also extremely dismissive of anything I'm interested in or excel at. I used to write short stories, and she never wanted to read any of them. "You write depressing tragic stuff, I don't want to read that crap," she'd say, and it crushed me. At this point, I am extremely reluctant to share anything about my life with her, because she'll just downplay it and make me feel bad about myself.

My mom is an extreme people-pleaser and growing up, I never saw healthy assertiveness modeled to me-- only fawning and avoiding others whenever possible.

My parents are still married, but not "in love" at all. I don't remember them ever sharing a bedroom. Growing up I think I absorbed the belief that romantic love isn't a priority. Far better instead to work a lot and get the bills paid. By the time I was 12 I remember thinking, "Why would anyone get married? You just have to work around the other person like they're an obstacle.."

My dad and I are very close, we have a great relationship. But it's not perfect of course, and there have been times where he's been dismissive of my feelings, or didn't understand what I was feeling (example: panic attacks -- he's never had one and doesn't understand them). Overall, though, a much better relationship than with my mom.

So now as an adult, I have a fearful-avoidant attachment style. Closeness with others is terrifying for me, and sets off all kinds of internal alarm bells. It's like I shut down completely after a certain point. I'm very, very happy to be single. Dating just causes stress and overwhelm. Maybe if I ever get better with basic boundaries and communication, I'll feel like dating. Until then, casual work friendships are about all I can handle.

Sorry for rambling on! TL;DR: Had some similar experiences to yours growing up, and as a result it's almost impossible for me to maintain meaningful intimacy with anyone. I keep relationships shallow to protect myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have this same issue. I've been slowly building up the habit of "standing by" my likes and interests. It's hard, though, with people that have really strong, combative personalities (overall I like to avoid those types in general, I just don't have the energy.)

I feel like any difference in opinion sets up possibility for argument and debate, and that the other person will look down on me and be condescending about the things I like (come through, childhood baggage! Thanks, mom and grandmom!) So I tend to freeze up and not say anything at all when discussing things like books, movies, music unless the other person has already expressed approval of something. I don't like being that way, but with some conscious effort I'm hoping to change the habit.

Somewhat related, if lots of other people are interested in/have seen or experienced something I haven't, it makes me feel very insecure and I feel like I "should" be interested in or do that thing. Or if I'm not interested in something lots of other people like, my automatic reaction is "Oh, there must be something wrong with me, better keep quiet about this."

Sorry for the long response! I've been thinking about this kind of stuff a lot lately. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think I have....I am FA. With my last boyfriend (first and only "real" relationship so far) I pushed him away after a few months of dating because I knew it was a dead-end relationship. But as soon as we stopped talking I felt immediate panic and regret. We got back together and dated for 4 years. I was low-key very frustrated with the relationship most of the time, and felt trapped/stifled. I would daydream about being single again, and tell myself things like "This is only temporary" and "Just deal with it for now." He finally ended things and I was relieved.

I had been terrified to end things with him again myself, because I'd done it before and felt such intense regret, and I didn't want to go through that again. But I guess by the time we broke up the second time, it was very obvious that we were going nowhere, the illusion had run its course, and it was well and truly over.

A few months after that I found out about attachment theory and it explained everything. LOL.

Not sure if this is what you were getting at but yes, there has been a time where I stayed with someone I wasn't even all that jazzed about because I felt like I couldn't leave due to attachment stuff. </TEXT>

If I didn't react in *exactly* the right way they'd get really agitated and call me "ungrateful, spoiled, rude," etc. I started to dread occasions where I'd receive gifts because I knew I'd have to "perform."

Even now when someone gives me a gift, I'm overwhelmed with extreme guilt and anxiety. It makes me feel shaky and scared. I thank them profusely, sometimes probably too much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This happens to me, too! Then I end up compulsively searching for an identical item or something very similar to "make up for it".

To overcome it, I try to remind myself of all the stuff I already own, all the "oh-em-gee I absolutely have to have this, I must buy it" and got it and there it sits in my closet, unused. So it was a "win" and a dopamine rush to get the item, but ultimately it's just taking up space.

I comfort myself with this when I miss out on an item. Effectiveness varies depending on the item, how "rare" it is, etc. It also reminds me that while I've been doing better overall, I am still very much a compulsive shopper/hoarder at heart and I should focus some energy on letting things go.

YMMV but that helps keep it in perspective for me, usually, sometimes....LOL. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, I experience this too. It creates so much insecurity in me when I realize I don't have a well-developed sense of self. I'm 29 and I still feel like a teenager, sort of trying out different things and "identities" to figure things out.

Lately I've been focusing on self-care, and reading up on basic health practices and even family/consumer sciences sorts of things (home economics) to help create a schedule and routine for myself so my most basic needs are met (sleep and regular meals). If I can master those things, and start processing my childhood trauma, maybe I'll have energy for some interests and hobbies.

It honestly surprises me that other people have time and energy for recreation, and for doing things that are "just for fun." Like how are they not caught up in just getting by, just making it to the end of the day? I feel intense guilt and anxiety if I do something that doesn't serve a practical, concrete purpose.

One thing I do love is listening to music -- I think because I'm a "maladaptive daydreamer" and I can slip into the fantasy worlds inside my head while doing it.

Yes, this describes it perfectly....I hate revealing anything about myself to other people because I'm so worried they'll save it up and torture me with it later on. My mom and grandma love to embarrass and humiliate me. I feel almost like a politician when I socialize, because I take a lot of time to come up with "safe" responses to questions I might get. And I feel intense regret when I reveal something about myself that I'm embarrassed of or struggling with. THEN I feel frustrated because my friendships are superficial and shallow, LOL!

My mom does the competition thing, too, even with things that don't really matter. She's always been in competition with her SIL that she hates, for years has always made fun of her behind her back, and is desperate to be seen as "better" than her even though no one else is concerned about this or even thinks of them enough to compare the two. Back in high school I caught myself doing this sort of thing with my peers, always trying to prove myself to be the "best" in all areas without being obvious about it. At least I hope it wasn't obvious to others, LOL. God I was such a try-hard! I still am now but at least I know why, and awareness helps.

Don't apologize, holidays like this always bring up times of reflection for me as well. It's crazy the stuff those of us with CPTSD were raised with and thought of as "normal"! </TEXT>

<TEXT> This sounds just like my mom and grandma! My grandma passed away a few years ago but my mom still does this. She's never had a "real" friend, just someone she tolerates for some specific purpose (example: her hairdresser, her nail tech, and her "friends" that will drive her to faraway places for concerts and stuff). Then once she comes back home she trash talks them and puts them down and laughs about them.

Little wonder, then, that I resisted making a lot of friends, and I didn't trust the ones I did have, especially girl/woman friends. Even now I still find myself second-guessing their motives and feeling very reluctant to be close to them.

Romantically, I love keeping things in the crush/flirtation phase because I know as soon as we start dating "for real" the cycle will start all over again and I'll end up resenting and avoiding them. This happens in almost all of my friendships, too.

I always knew something was "off" and dysfunctional with the way I related to others, but it wasn't until I found out about attachment theory that I had a name for it. I always just thought it was because I'm an introvert with depression and social anxiety. Finding out that I'm fearful-avoidant was like discovering a missing puzzle piece. </TEXT>

I also did a declutter during my time off and that has helped my motivation to not buy as much stuff. For the first time in my life, I've been able to more or less stick to a budget.

Now that I think about it, I haven't mentioned shopping or money things to my therapist in over a month.

I still have way too much stuff, and the temptation to shop is always there to some degree. Hopefully I'll be able to build on the progress I've made and not regress. Don't want to get too excited because I've had 3-6 month stretches of "doing better" and then I would completely fall off the wagon. </TEXT>

Funnily enough, I've gotten a similar comment when I've been doing chores. I hate when I'm doing something that lets my mind wander because it immediately starts ruminating. It's easier to dissociate when I'm occupied with something else (music, a movie, etc). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great write-up....I love how cohesive and thematic Reputation is. I also think Ready For It is a perfect first track. I still remember the first time I listened to Rep, how excited that track got me, hahaha. And then it goes into End Game which is just....really cool. And we go through all the chaos and emotions and anger and fear and insecurity with the whole tracklist. And it closes with New Year's Day, which is perfect because it's a quiet, chill, reflective song, a gentle comedown from everything before it, like she's found happiness with her man and she can let go of all the stress and anger she vented before. A fantastic album. </TEXT>

<TITLE> [TOMT] [POEM][1700s-1800s] Poem about an insane man by the seashore </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-06-11 21:40:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I took a British Lit class in college and I remember reading a poem about an insane man living by the beach. The poem's narrator suggested that she was envious of the man because he had no responsibilities or obligations to "real life."

I'm about 80% sure the poet was a woman, and the time period it was written in was 1700s-1800s.

I've looked for this poem off and on through the years and haven't been able to find it again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow, yes, this is so true! Especially at work. Last week I had to remind myself, "These are fairly normal people, not your family. Just tell them you don't know how where the key is for the laptop cabinet. And if they get annoyed, that's on them! You've never had to unlock it before, why would you know where the key is?"

Also reminds me of high school when my mom made me a toasted bagel and I noticed it was moldy, and I sat there frozen, staring at it, unsure of how to act. I was afraid to tell her it was moldy because she'd get mad and somehow it would feel like it was my fault. Finally she walked by and asked why I wasn't eating, and I stammered that the bagel had mold on it, and she exploded and was all "Well don't just sit there like an idiot, we have other things we can eat, why are you like this? God...." and went on and on.

I swear someone could run up and stab me and I'd just be like, "Oh, they must be angry, had to ease some tension, I won't take it personally," and just sit there and bleed to death l0l.

&#x200B;

> More than once I've wished I could just phase into a cloud of, like... consciousness that didn't need to eat, drink, sleep, or be noticed.

I can relate to this, too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! Back in college I was obsessed with The Secret and things like that and I can't tell you how much of my trauma I was glossing over with positive affirmations and gratitude lists. Did it work? Hell no, of course it didn't, at best it just confused and upset me further and I still ended up having a nervous breakdown. I was basically just gaslighting myself and invalidating my own experiences.

> They are a normalized freeze response / normalized dissociation. It's no wonder they are so "up in the clouds" about everything and have trouble distinguishing between things in reality under the guise of "we are one".

This, too - Back when I was immersed in that stuff I ended up becoming totally confused and even more helpless than I normally am, because I'd get angry about something and then think "well that person is really me, so I shouldn't be angry, I should just process and analyze why I attracted this and made it happen" and as a result, I've never made any progress with being assertive or talking about how I feel. </TEXT>

Fills me with rage when I think about it, actually. I suppose the anger is a good sign, because it means I'm starting to heal. I've also become super-aware of gaslighting behaviors in other areas of my life, and I'm getting better at boundaries. It's a process, but I'm glad to know I'm not even that "crazy," I've just been dealing with emotionally immature/unavailable people most of my life. </TEXT>

I also hate that I have to throw away old notebooks and paperwork in random trash cans at gas stations and stuff because she goes through my garbage. She only lets me get rid of something when it's HER decision, not mine. The other week she took my laundry out of the dryer and folded it....I looked in the trash, and sure enough she'd thrown away two of my shirts. I rescued the shirts and rewashed them. Didn't say anything about it to her because I knew it'd just end up being WW3.

<TEXT> Yes! I immediately start thinking of all the reasons the person did what they did, how they probably didn't mean it, and even if they did, I probably deserved it or provoked them in some way, and if I get angry they won't care about my point of view anyway.

I feel like showing anger is very vulnerable, because you're showing you care about something or something bothers you. Once people know what upsets you, they can use this as ammunition to abuse and manipulate you with. So I keep it all inside and appear as "neutral" and unbothered as possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Often one just needs an ID with the current address (maybe bring an extra piece of official mail just to be safe). You'll probably fill out a form with your name, address, birthdate, phone number, email, etc. Usually you need to be at least 18; under 18 needs a parent/guardian to sign them up so as to specify whether they're allowed Internet access.

The libraries in my state are free to join for residents, and a yearly fee applies for out-of-state patrons.

This all varies depending on where you live, etc. But you will most likely just need to prove your identity and address in some way.

Once your system reopens, if it hasn't already, you can probably call and ask what you'd need to get a card. </TEXT>

Going back on Monday and I dread it. I don't think I can fake it anymore with my colleagues. They wear me out and bore the hell out of me and I don't like sharing personal information with any of them because I feel like they'll use it as emotional blackmail.

I'm becoming more and more closed off and reclusive, and the more I do this, the better my mental health gets, it seems. I can't be around others without getting triggered into a flashback and then I have to pretend I'm okay when really I'm in hell. I know it's not practical to avoid everyone because of that, but for now it seems like the best option while I work on my cptsd. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup yup, looking back I can see where I've been "catnip" for people with really strong personalities that were at times abusive/manipulative because I just go with the flow and don't really care about anything....

I knew a guy sort of like the one you mentioned in college, he was so pushy and weird, at the time I was like "he's just friendly and outgoing, I need to be more openminded, this is college after all" but now I can see he was just a creep. I HATE that I always invalidate my gut feelings about other people and "go along to get along" and then regret it and look back like "oh yeah, should have seen that coming." For years after we stopped talking I was so terrified I'd run into him somewhere. I actually saw him at a WalMart a few months ago and felt that same old familiar terror go through my body. I don't know if he saw me or not, he was in line with a woman and they had a baby in a stroller.

Your last sentences -- yes, yes, I feel that so much, the mirroring/fawning and just saying whatever I feel they want me to say.

Thanks for sharing, and for reading, I'm glad we're not alone in this! </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the most valuable things I've learned about it was that there are *very good reasons* as to why I'm like this. FA is maladaptive but it was the only way baby/child me could deal with emotionally neglectful caregivers. So when I get frustrated with myself and have those "Why am I like this" moments, I think back and remind myself that it's a pattern I've learned and it's not going to change overnight.

Currently I have very strict social boundaries (which have been reinforced by quarantine) and this is a way to protect myself as I learn to communicate with others more effectively and also figure out what my identity is. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been dealing with this, too. My mom seemed to expect me to read her mind about when and how to clean stuff, but she never showed me how or set up any kind of "chore schedule." She's also a hoarder and gets mad if you touch any of her things, even accidentally, but loves to throw other people's things away. Now I'm a hoarder too and I can't keep my room clean. I even bought an old "home ec/life skills" type of textbook on ebay to study that and try to figure out how to not live in a rat's nest anymore. But of course reading about cleaning and actually cleaning are two different things, l0l. And I get very, very anxious when I attempt to do any sort of chores. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate when this happens, too. I really can't complain because I've done it to people, not really intentionally. But with the people where I thought we were really friends and had a true connection, I would always respond to. It's really unnerving to just be ignored completely. And I know it's about them, not me, and often doesn't really mean anything, but I feel humiliated when I reach out and then get ignored because I don't have much social "real estate" as it is and I need to preserve my dignity as much as possible. In my case this is all closely related to my fearful-avoidant attachment style, and being aware of that helps....but honestly the older I get the more I just want to cut everyone off and be a hermit. I ramble below about two recent examples from my own life:

I emailed one of these people about a month ago asking her opinion on something I was worried about. I also made a joke about it being my birthday the next day and how I was "too old to be worrying about stuff like this". She never answered me, and it really hurt my feelings. Especially because for my birthday a few years ago she took me out and spent the day with me. And now she won't even answer an email from me. We'd been close for years and I honestly thought my friendship with hers was one of the healthier relationships in my life. But she completely ignored me, and now looking back, I can see where maybe our friendship wasn't as good as I thought it was. That may just be me looking for reasons to not miss her, but to be fair I'd always had inklings that she never really respected me and she had frequently been condescending towards me. So, I'm going to let this particular friendship go.

Another friend is a work friend. She'd had surgery for a brain tumor (!!!) right before quarantine started, and I hesitated contacting her because I didn't know if her vision had returned. She actually emailed me first, and we had a great conversation, and at the end of the email she actually put "Pleeeeeaaaase let's stay in touch." A couple weeks later I sent her an article I thought she would be interested in, along with a note....no response. A couple of days ago I emailed her something else, a funny coincidence that had happened to me, and no response. I'm trying not to freak out because it's possible she's still recovering from surgery and stuff, and I hope she's okay. But I feel so embarrassed to have sent her two emails, with an interval in-between, that got ignored. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh my gosh, yes, I also do that "lapdog mode" thing, I always end up being a sidekick too! So many friendships I've had were like that. The whole friendship is basically me tagging along while they pursue their goals. My romantic relationship was like that, too, and a few times he did say things like "Let's do something you want this weekend, we always do my stuff," and it made me feel so empty and self conscious because I don't really have the type of hobbies I could share with another person. I just listen to music or watch movies and daydream.

And, yes, the censoring myself thing -- I do that as well, even with things that would only be minor "disagreements." Yep, I've got a few people I am terrified of running into because they're probably wondering why the friendship just disintegrated and I ghosted them.... </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can relate to this, especially the thoughts in your mind and it's like you're being interviewed for TV. I spend a lot of time doing stuff like that. I personally am a maladaptive daydreamer, there's a sub on the subject (r/maladaptivedaydreaming) if you want to learn more about it.

I talk out loud to myself a lot when I'm alone, but I'm very quiet when around other people. I guess talking out loud to myself is a way of making up for all the things I feel like I can't say when I'm with others.

When in a situation where there's no TV or music as a buffer, like when I would eat dinner at a friend's house and the parents would talk to us and want to hear about our day, I also felt kind of nervous and apprehensive. "Real" connection with others is scary and overwhelming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The very, very few times I've tried to set boundaries with my mom she reacts with extreme anger and then gaslights and manipulates me, says things like "You're taking your mood out on me and that's not fair, it's not my fault you're so miserable" and "You're so sensitive and odd, you're going to have to get over that nonsense".....she has never accepted a boundary that I can remember. She deflects the issue at hand and makes it about my mental health.

Now that I think about it, the only times she has backed off were when I snapped and started screaming at her, but then of course she gets to tell everyone how crazy and unstable I am. So a calmly stated boundary would be the way to go, but she will not respond to those. Oddly enough, after I'd screamed at her, she would usually treat me with fawning behavior to my face (while simultaneously trash talking me to friends and family about how "loopy" I am). At this point I've given up.

Example: Just last week, I did some laundry while she was at work. I forgot to get it out of the dryer before she came home, and the next morning the basket was in front of my bedroom door with the clothes folded. She has a habit of throwing some of my clothes away if she gets to my laundry, so that's why I only do my wash when she's not home. (She thinks my clothes are "worn out" and not good enough, or some bullshit.) Sure enough, I went downstairs and two of my shirts were in the trash. (I have about 10-12 of the same exact tee shirt so she probably thought I wouldn't notice). I rescued the shirts and set them aside to rewash. Mom was in the shower while I did this, and I thought about what I should say to her. If we could communicate "normally", I would say, "It's really not necessary for you to fold my laundry, and it's not right for you to throw my clothes away. You need to stop doing this." But I ended up just not saying anything, because I knew it would turn into WW3 and I just didn't have the energy.

So it's been *years* since I've tried to communicate with her about boundaries, either in a calm way or an angry way. And I'm terrified to try and set boundaries with other people, because I feel like they'll react the way she does. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup, I'm a freeze/fawn as well. Spend most of my time dissociating, and am very happy to be alone. I spend hours and hours and hours on my laptop, listening to music and scrolling through different websites.

I am terrified of conflict of any kind and pretty much always find myself in a fawn mode when I have to deal with other people. I hate that I'm like that, so I keep to myself as much as possible.

ETA: Your example of being a guest at someone's home -- I do that, too. I've never been able to state my needs/wants, and at this point I'm not even consciously aware of what they are. </TEXT>

My mom has a habit of knocking and then just immediately opening the door (ugh) and she's given me some weird looks. One time I was right in front of the door when she opened it and she was like, "Why were you standing right by the door?" And I'm like....uhhhh....well why are you barging in? Hahaha

Oh man your story about pacing at your friend's house, yes, I'd totally be doing the same thing! I used to get lowkey pretty fidgety about not being able to pace while spending a lot of time at a friend's house. I'd like, debate whether it was worth having a sleepover or not lmao. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, that's pretty cool! I like to think it's a sign that our loved ones are still with us, reaching out, letting us know they care.

I lost my older brother to suicide just over a year ago, 5/27/2019. Went to work a couple of days ago (5/27) for the first time since quarantine and was putting books away when I came across a bunch on death, grieving, finding meaning in life, etc. Flipped through some of them, put them away, and moved on to the next section.

A bright orange book caught my eye....and the author had the same first and last name as my brother! Not a rare name at all but I'd never heard of that author before. I feel like this was my brother reaching out, and saying hello.

Sending you peace and comfort. <3 </TEXT>

It sounds like they have a pattern of glossing over things or not really respecting your feelings, and it might just turn into another blowout argument. Of course you always have the option of stating your reasons and then simply ignoring any response messages. But yeah, either way it's okay to let go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> \[Whoops, I rambled! TL;DR: I also can't find fulfillment in my job & I hope you find something you like!\]

I can relate to the seeing others grow in a career they seem to enjoy -- I just turned 29 and so many of my peers seem to have settled into something that gives them satisfaction and they have a decent amount of confidence in their abilities. Me, on the other hand, I've been at my job for five years and I still feel like a damn fraud.

I work part time at a public library and while I'm very grateful to even have a job, and to be in a library, I have to admit I don't really enjoy most of the work, it's very people-heavy (which I expected when I applied, but still get burnt out). Having had time off with Covid, I'm even more aware of how unnecessary my position is and how management has talked me into things I'm really not interested in.

Every now and then full time library jobs are posted and I just....can't see myself doing this full time day after day for years. But I can't picture any alternatives, either.

My coworkers will sometimes ask me if I'm going to grad school for library science and I hate when they ask me that because the answer is *hell no, it would be a huge waste of time and money like getting my bachelor's degree was* but then I don't want to get into a conversation about what I want to do in my future so I just smile and nod and say "thinking about it!"

It's basically impossible for me to find any meaning or value in life, and pressure to have a "career" just wears me out.

I fantasize about working the night shift at a gas station so I could sleep all day. But my parents would worry that I'd get robbed/murdered. And I have a hard time counting change, l0l.

Wishing you the best of luck with your job hunt, it's tough out there. I sincerely hope you find something you enjoy and pays well. <3 </TEXT>

No wonder I'm always fucking exhausted, when I have to work hard at not spiralling into mania and a migraine or a panic attack every second of the day.

Same here....I think I dissociate almost constantly. My favorite "hobbies" seem to be things where I can space out and doze off (listening to music, re-watching tv shows, etc). Anything that requires mental energy or effort is just too much. I used to want to write novels and short stories but it's been years since I've actually been able to focus on anything like that.

<TEXT> Yes, this is a big thing I struggle with! I feel anxious because I feel like I should be "planning" and "preparing" for my future, setting goals, figuring out what I want my life to look like, but I just freeze up and space out every time.

> I have vague plans like get fit, or develop my spirituality, but when it comes down to the actual planning of how I will do this I just freeze. As in total mind blank dissociation white noise type freeze.

This! This is me. Can't tell you how many times I've sat down with a notebook and tried to come up with some reasonable goals. Even if I think of something, it feels really hollow and meaningless and I don't follow through with it anyway. My mind now just goes blank when I try thinking about the future.

&#x200B;

> It all seems so alien to be setting goals to actually improve and develop myself and my life rather than purely based on survival.

This is relatable, too. Every day life is overwhelming as is, just doing the bare minimum. Just basic tasks are very tiring and draining. I've recently realized I spend a lot of mental energy on dissociating and avoiding flashbacks, so I guess that's why I'm often so tired and can't get seem to focus or get much done.

Quarantine has been fabulous because I haven't had to go to work in about two months. I cleaned up my room and while still cluttered, it's better than it was. But now I'm stuck on what to do next. I want to use my free time wisely but I just can't decide what to do.

I've decided that I'm going to place most of my focus on healing my trauma and just starting from there. Once I process some of my unexpressed emotions I'm hoping I'll start to feel more alive and I'll be able to set goals. </TEXT>

Yes, I do this too!

Logically I know it would have been better to let him know or call him out on hurtful things but my default is to just kind of go "Oh, okay...." and dissociate. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is so relatable, especially the always having music or a show playing. Just me by myself with my thoughts is a recipe for disaster....I get caught up in my deep-seated anger and rage I feel towards my mother (and other people, mostly my mother though) and I'm so frustrated because I don't know how to "exorcise" this rage once and for all so I can stop triggering myself and reliving it. I have to spend most of my life dissociating so I don't get caught up in a flashback. Exhausting.

Another commenter mentioned maladaptive daydreaming -- I do that quite often, pacing back and forth for hours on end while listening to music and it's usually fun and relaxing except for the times when I'm ruminating I start pacing around and getting all wound up.

As each year goes by (just turned 29) it's getting harder and harder for me to function with all the suppressed chaos in my body and mind.

I've done yoga for years, and that is a good help. It's one of the few times I'm fully "in my body" and not caught up in my head. Walks outside are good too. Have never really successfully tried meditation, just thinking about it makes me feel itchy and irritated (probably a sign that I would benefit from it, l0l).

I've also been looking into "tapping" aka the emotional freedom technique which I think claims to help clear old energy patterns in one's body. So I plan to give that a try, if I can stop dissociating long enough to focus on learning something new.

Here's to both of us finding health and healing! </TEXT>

Reminds me of a book "Spiritual Mentoring of Teens" I flipped through and there was a whole chapter on sexuality and there was a sub-section about "praying with your child for their future spouse to appear in their lives" and I thought damn, when I was 15 I was worried about just getting to the bus stop on time, not marriage! But of course they wanna live like it's the 1700s.

<TEXT> I struggle with this. It started in childhood -- I'd read and re-read the same books or chapters from books over and over again.

In school I remember having silent meltdowns when I'd be reading a textbook and it had all kinds of infographics and pictures with captions, like "oh no, I'll never remember all of this, I'm going to have to read this so many times...."

Even ends of paragraphs, or sentences, can slow me up. I feel like I have to pause and check with myself to see if I'm comprehending everything.

Ironically the most progress I make with reading is when I allow myself to do it "sloppily" -- skipping pages, only reading what interests me, etc. It stresses me out that I'm not doing it "right" but I have to do it that way or I'll never finish the book. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So, what with quarantine and being required to wear masks in public, I've found that it's a bit easier to  talk to people. When I go out I've got a mask and a baseball hat on and I like having that coverage.

I think a lot of it has to do with not being able to see as many "microexpressions" on people, so there's less material for my anxious brain to fixate on and obsess over. You can still read a lot on people because of their eyes and eyebrows but with everyone's face more or less covered I just feel so much more comfortable.

I mentioned this to my therapist and she said that was interesting, because someone else she knows is having a hard time with the masks, and it increases their social anxiety.

What do you all think? Are masks "yay or nay" for social anxiety? I guess it all depends on the individual person! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. One of the things about being a child in abusive situations is, we don't know how something's "wrong." We can sense it but until we meet other people we don't realize it isn't normal. In my case this caused me to withdraw even further because I didn't want people to know how weird my family was/is. I'm still very secretive about my family life and living situation.

At least as an adult we have the power to start learning about our trauma and have names for the things that happened and the dynamics we experienced. I'd hate to be a child again, feeling so lost and empty in the world. I still feel that way as an adult, but at least now I have therapy and books and ways to educate myself and start a healing process.

Some people really idealize childhood and like you said, I envy them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a fawn/freeze type as well. I've gotten into situations that ended up reinforcing the already existing trauma I had because I just couldn't say no.

My big fear with saying "no" is that it won't be respected or taken seriously. Then I'll have the stress of doing something I don't want to do, combined with repressed rage at being disrespected *yet again.* It's morphed into this weird coping mechanism where I just never speak up and assert myself because that way I only have one thing to be secretly angry about, instead of two.

This happens at work when I have to tell people to take their phone calls to the lobby (it's a library setting.) SO MANY TIMES the person just ignores me and waves me off, and then I freeze up and internally die inside. My heart rate goes up and I feel shaky and stupid the rest of the day. I hate that I can't enforce basic rules, both in my professional and personal life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> >  I feel much more safe and ‘in control’ if I can read a person’s intentions carefully and then passively/stealthily respond to get what I need.

Not OP but this really resonates with me. I feel like I'm always being "sneaky" just to get basic needs met, or better yet, conceal any and all of my needs completely.

It's so irritating when people say "Just say no!" or "Just say what you want!" Because it's like....what if I say no and then get punished for that and have resources withheld (childhood experiences)....and I can't say what I want because I don't know what I want, I don't have any sense of self or autonomy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They were better once I got out of college. College was absolute hell. When I got my part-time library job I started earning money (and some autonomy) and that helped a bit. I spent 4 years in a dead-end relationship and also developed a shopping addiction.

But, now at 29 I feel like I can let go of a lot of things I felt like should matter to me but really didn't. Like, I can live true to myself in a way that was too hard for me to do at 20. I've also learned a lot about myself.

I've had awareness of my self-destructive patterns for a while now, and now I feel like I might finally be able to break some of those cycles. </TEXT>

My mom, though, I've never been close to. I remember being a small child and already just being so over her shit. Contempt just radiates from her. I know she doesn't like me. She didn't like my brother, either. Anytime I would show any kind of personal preference or autonomy, she would screech that I was "nasty and stubborn". Now as an adult I'm empty and directionless and she gets to complain about that. My maternal grandmom lived with us and helped raise me (both parents worked full time). She was extremely manipulative and emotionally neglectful. So I got a "double whammy" of emotional neglect from my mom and grandmom. Their voices combined comprise my harsh inner critic. </TEXT>

In my case I buy a lot of vintage Avon jewelry online, stuff like that, where it's not necessarily "rare" but would be hard to find again. So then I'm like "Oh my gosh this is a once in a lifetime deal, I'll never find anything like this again, I better just get it now".

I have quite a few things that are similar to each other, and I wish I could just pick my "favorite" and let the others go, but I haven't been able to.

In quarantine I haven't worn jewelry or makeup at all, except on my birthday. </TEXT>

I'm expected to sit and listen to all her long drawn out stories bitching about pretty much every person she's ever interacted with in her entire life, but when I want to talk about something, she blows me off or tells me it's my fault, that I'm mean and bitchy, etc. But none of her problems are ever her fault. EVER! I hate talking to her.

My mom also does a dismissive "nah" type thing -- we aren't Spanish speaking but it sounded really close to what your mom does -- mine makes this noise in her throat, kind of like "hm" anytime I say something that she thinks is stupid (which is often). I HATE THAT NOISE SO MUCH. I WANT TO SCREAM WHEN SHE DOES IT. I CAN'T STAND HER. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 29F here, I love being childfree and single. If I'm ever in a relationship again, it'll have to be someone who is okay with never living together. I really, really need my solitude. I still live with my parents but the house is big enough we can all leave each other alone, LOL.

I've known since about age 12 that I didn't want kids or a relationship. I haven't always stuck to the relationship part but honestly the older I get the better I am at knowing what's best for me and resisting social pressure (and that social pressure can be *intense.*) I don't have a strong personality and I'm scared that if I'm in a relationship I'll lose myself completely.

I think I might be asexual, if not I have very low libido. I also have a fearful-avoidant attachment style, which I'm sure has something to do with my wanting to be alone all the time and not get too close to anyone. But I'm content with who I am. I love having the freedom to work on myself and do what's best for me, without worrying about someone else's needs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good questions!

With this particular friend, looking back over the past couple of years, our interactions had seemed a bit "off" for some time. Just sort of off kilter, like we weren't syncing as well as we used to. So I already felt insecure about this friend and how she feels about me, but we didn't talk often enough for me to be comfortable saying "Hey, I feel like something's up between us, is it just me?" Basically my fearful tendencies had already built up and then when she ignored my email it felt like the "last straw". Again, I know how one-sided this all is, because I've never actually asked her if she's mad at me or anything. It's just a \~vibe\~ I was getting. So, at this point, it would be way too difficult for me to overlook this.

\[For what it's worth, this person was one of my teachers in high school, we really bonded and she was a mentor for me, we have similar mental health issues with anxiety. She was like an aunt to me, we were super close. In fact, for my birthday in 2014 she took me out for the day, she bought me clothes and took me to dinner. And now this year she didn't even write back to tell me happy birthday. So for her to ignore me really hurts because it feels like when my mom ignores and belittles me, triggering an intense childhood wound.\]

I've thought about trying to break my patterns, but man actually doing it is *hard.* I've spent most of my life hiding from others, even family members, and I feel like I have good reasons for doing so. I don't have the kind of "social real estate" that would allow me to take risks and reach out. I have the emotional bandwidth the size of a postage stamp, and I must save it for matters of self-preservation.

Sorry for rambling again! I wanted to give a thorough answer.

Edit: spelling

Edit 2: grammar </TEXT>

<TEXT> FA here \[TL;DR at the bottom\]....everyone's different but in my case I think it's the embarrassment of reaching out and then what if the other person doesn't get back to me. Makes me feel crazy, weak, stupid, and undesirable. Throughout my life I've had instances of friendships, etc. where I was more interested than the other person and I guess by the time I became an adult I was very, very guarded. So now I'm extremely selective about who I reach out to and why.

Just a few weeks ago I emailed a friend of mine about something I wanted her opinion on, something I knew she had experience with, and she never answered me. This really hurt my feelings. I feel like a damn fool. I really opened up and was vulnerable about something, and my birthday was within a few days, and to get NOTHING in response. I'll never tell her that, though -- if she ever contacts me I won't answer even if my life depends on it. We're done. I know it's not "healthy" to be like this but at this point in my life it's the only thing I know how to do.

I don't have close friends where we talk all the time, more like people I'll have text/email conversations with once every three/four months. I haven't dated in a long time and don't want to.

It's weird being FA. It's like I have disdain for everyone who wants to get close to me, but I also desperately crave their approval. I'm pretty toxic so it's better if I keep people at a distance.

Hahaha wow this got long, sorry! TL;DR: I don't reach out because if I don't get a response it upsets and embarrasses me. I'm a social "omega wolf" and keep my distance to retain what little dignity I do have. Basically I'm a control freak. </TEXT>

I work part time at a public branch and enjoy it for the most part, but I can see now how during my time there I've been kind of talked into taking on things I'm really not interested in/don't feel play to my strengths. I've been thinking about the management and overall "culture" and I'm pretty sure I don't want to go full-time. Idk. I love libraries and it can be rewarding but also very draining. Dealing with the public can be very challenging as well. Yeah, it's a lot to think about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oh man....that would have been my answer too.

I remember getting a quizzical look from a college professor one time. We were doing an exercise about our "happy places" and she wanted to hear our write-ups. She said "Did anyone have a happy place that isn't the beach?" and I raised my hand. Then I had to share with the class that my happy place was a small bedroom, sparsely furnished, with a window with a view to a meadow. There is a bed made up but I like to rest underneath the bed and feel the cool hardwood floors beneath me, and watch the sun and shadows move throughout the day. Completely hidden and safe. The door is locked and only I can unlock it. As I was reading this out loud I realized how weird it was going to sound to others but I couldn't stop. And the look the professor gave me was priceless. "So you'd sleep *under* the bed?" she asked, and I can still feel the tingles of shame as I stammered out an answer. Very odd moment overall. </TEXT>

I made plans to go to a friend's house and she asked me to bring my CD's and we'd burn copies and she'd make copies of hers for me. I got really excited and said "Yeah! And then we can pace back and forth while we listen!" And she was like ".....Why do we have to pace?" I was like "Did I say pace? I meant dance. Yes. Dancing." </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's pretty interesting, maybe it's a common theme in MDD to have scenarios where we're being observed. Your daydream setup reminds me of when I was obsessed with reality shows. and I wanted to make one about myself. This was in about 2010-2011 I think, right around when YouTubers and vlogging became like a massive thing.

I quickly realized that my "real life" is actually extremely boring and I would want a reality show about my fantasy life, which my favorite people then tune in to watch and comment on. I actually wrote out different "episode" ideas. My mom found it and I was so embarrassed lmao (I was 19-20 at the time). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I deal with this every time I do a room clean-out. I haven't had mice but I do have carpet beetles and they make me really squeamish about going under my bed. If I'm able, I move the mattress off my bed -- this is hard though because it's really heavy. Usually I just crawl under if I feel brave enough.

I tie my hair back, wear gloves, a face mask, and bring a flash light. Afterwards I treat myself to a long hot shower.

You can do this! Do you get good natural lighting in your bedroom during the day? That can help a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was "fine" when we were on our first few dates and just "hanging out" (still really anxious because I was afraid of where it might lead, half-hoping he'd lose interest and ghost me, half hoping we'd keep dating because I did really like him.) Honestly the first few months we were together were rather tumultuous, at least for me -- we'd spend the day together, have a great time, and then at the end I'd start panicking and want to have intense discussions about "where this is going" and say things like "we should quit while we're ahead, we don't have a chance." He'd try to reassure me and tell me to just relax and take things one day at a time, but I was terrified. Terrified mixed with happiness, because like I said, I did honestly care for him; I was just afraid I wouldn't be able to "live up to" the demands of a relationship.

In my times of distancing, I liked it best when he spent time with his friends and family or on a hobby like his video games. I was lucky in that he frequently went on weeklong hunting trips with his dad and uncles, stuff like that so I was able to have "breaks" with less contact.

Sorry this got so long! To sum up, basically one of my concerns was that he was too "relationship oriented," that he placed too much importance on me and I felt comforted when he maintained his other social connections. I know how odd that must sound, and it didn't make any sense to me at the time. I didn't learn about attachment theory until after we broke up, so I had no idea why I was like that (I just chalked it up to being introverted). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do something like this, I'll think about people I know or used to know, and they feature prominently in my daydreams. Like sometimes I get obsessed with someone and I know how ominous that sounds, but I just think about them a lot and they're in the stories in my head, usually I imagine scenarios where I'm doing something cool or performing or just being really witty and funny and they witness it.

For example, I like to imagine that I was in low-budget movies that are posted on YouTube and I like to think about the person I'm fixated on stumbling across these and watching me and being like "Oh! I know that person! She never mentioned she had these small acting roles" and then they ask me about it. Stuff like that. Or I'm a singer performing at a local fair and they happen to be there in the audience.

I know what you mean about social media, it makes it so easy to look them up all the time and get new "daydream fuel." I feel like a whole ass creep but since it's all in my head and I haven't  escalated, I guess it's okay.

I've talked about it some with my therapist and she feels it may be linked to my overall shyness and reluctance to open up to other people, hence the daydreams. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 29F here, I can relate to a lot of this. I've known since childhood I didn't want to marry or have kids. From 2014-2018 I was actually in a relationship, I'm shocked we lasted that long. He'd talk about getting married, having kids....and I'd just sort of freeze up inside.

I felt so confused about it all, because he was a sweet, loving guy who really wanted to make me happy....but I was happiest when I was driving home *alone* after spending the day with him, finally able to listen to the music I like, and getting home and being able to watch the shows/movies I like (unless he called to say goodnight and we ended up talking for an hour, ugh).

I hated spending my days off with him, it felt like a huge sacrifice. Then I felt guilty for feeling so much resentment. We did have fun together, I don't want to make it sound like it was horrible. But there was definitely a lot of inner conflict. Didn't want to potentially lose something really good because like you said, what if society is right? But afraid to take it to the next level.

A big reason the relationship worked was because he was a Christian waiting until marriage to have sex. I think I might be asexual, if I'm not, then I have extremely low libido. (Still figuring that one out...) But I liked not having any sexual pressure in a relationship, that was wonderful. Peace of mind. But of course if we got married sex would be part of the deal.

He ended things and I was relieved. Been single ever since and it's been lovely.

A few months after we broke up, a mutual friend told me that when I was with him, he seemed to subsume me, and she "couldn't find \[me\] in there" when he would talk about things. This was really upsetting because it was my biggest fear about being in a relationship. But also good feedback. He was more extraverted talked a lot more than I did.

Also, I later found out I have an avoidant attachment style, which explained so many things. Not saying this is what your attachment style is, but might be worth looking into if you're interested in that sort of thing.

TL;DR: So, there's no right or wrong answer, and I'm sorry I rambled so much. Basically don't be afraid of being true to yourself. Society is often wrong, and overgeneralizes things. </TEXT>

But damn if I'm not tempted to go and get them and stuff them back into the drawer they came from. I haven't worn them since 2012, and I hate how tight skinny jeans are, makes me claustrophobic. But I did get a lot of use out of them and they're still in good condition so I feel like I should keep them. Same with the pajamas my mom gave me when I was about 11-12; a set of sweatshirt night gowns. I wore them from sixth grade through twelfth grade. I feel like I need to keep them because I've had them so long. I asked my mom if she wants them back but she doesn't. So they're in limbo right now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting! It's rare, but refreshing, to see this kind of honesty from a mother. The fact that she says she became a mother at 41, I'm wondering if she was feeling pressure and went along with it.

Reminds me a bit of the author Marisa de los Santos, I read in an interview I think where she said she used to write poetry but stopped once she had kids because she didn't have enough concentration for it anymore. She writes novels now and is a full-time writer, so obviously it worked out, but I know I would hate to have my personal interests interrupted in any way, shape or form because of having kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That's a really good point, a lot of people become parents expecting their children to fulfill their emotional needs or fill a void in their life. This is way too much responsibility for a child -- after all, they didn't even ask to be born.
Similar to your experiences, my mom would also scream at me as a child/preteen for being "closed off" and "mean". This confused me so much because I didn't know how to articulate that I closed myself off around her as a way to protect myself! Of course if I'd been able to say that she'd probably have thrown me across the room.
To this day my mom will never admit to any fault with her interpersonal relationships. It's always the other person, never anything she did. This makes it so frustrating to try and communicate honestly with her.
Thanks for your comment! May we both experience hope and healing. <3 </TEXT>

That is so true! We as consumers don't really think about that, do we? At least I don't. I can't  tell you how many times I've gotten sucked into "Oh-em-gee this will be the best product ever, this mascara will change my life, this is so cool, I'm so fulfilled now" and then surprise surprise, it turns out to be just another mascara.

<TEXT> No worries, I appreciate your perspective!

I can definitely understand, and see how my mom might have had that reaction. My brother was too hyper and altogether "too much" for her, and while I was the girl she'd always hoped for, I didn't have the cheery, affectionate personality she would have preferred. This played out throughout my childhood in many ways (ex: she loved playing with dolls and I didn't; she actually bribed me into taking pictures with my doll stroller like the ones she had when she was that age. She also wanted me to be a ballet dancer and I had no interest. Things like that)

Her mom was also pretty critical and harsh towards her, so she didn't have any experience of what a loving, accepting mother was like.

All in all, there are many, many factors in play with parent/child relationships. I've been fixating on emotional neglect because I discovered it recently, and I'm sure there's a ton of other factors to consider.

Thanks for your insightful comment! This stuff is fascinating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree - the parent should be initiating and cultivating a healthy emotional relationship with their infant.

Contempt destroys relationships, and it's especially devastating when it comes from your own mother. It messed up my brother, too. By the time he was an adult they were estranged and barely spoke. My mom blamed his alcoholism. Sometimes I debate on whether I should tell her that he felt like she hated him and that's one of the reasons he stayed away. He's gone now, he took his own life about a year ago. I've often felt suicidal myself. I'm thinking this chronic emptiness stems from emotional neglect. Of course I don't want to blame my upbringing for every little thing but that's where most issues start after all. Very complex.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Sometimes my mom likes to remind me of what I was like as a baby.

The story always goes like "You were so, so quiet. I'd sit you in front of the TV for Sesame Street and you wouldn't even look at the screen, you'd just stare at your hands. We'd take you places and you always looked up at the ceiling or away from us. I thought you were autistic or mentally challenged. So I took you to the doctor, they did a bunch of tests. They said nothing was wrong, just to talk to you more and play with you more. But how was I supposed to do that? You didn't want anything to do with me."

The fact that she says the doctor told her to interact with me more is very telling.

My brother was hyper as a child (and an adult, tbh), into everything and very curious. I think he overwhelmed my parents, and that's one of the reasons they waited eleven years to have me.

So I'm sure my different temperament seemed a little "off" to my mom, but the way she tells the story hurts my feelings. It hurts me that she blames *me* for being uninterested and "not liking" her. In fact that's a common refrain with her, she's always saying things like "my own children hate me, I don't get it." I've always felt so uncomfortable around her, because I know she doesn't like me, she's always treated me with contempt. So if she thinks I hate her, (~~honestly I do)~~ it's because of that. I don't know how to act around her and mostly I feel like it's easier if we don't talk.

Since learning about emotional neglect, it's been really enlightening. I keep thinking back over my life and I can see instances of being emotionally neglected, and patterns and issues that continue to this day.

TL;DR: My mom says I was so quiet and withdrawn as a baby that she thought something was wrong with me. Knowing what I know now about EN, I'm wondering if that's the reason I was like that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do this too!

I'm actually a full-blown hoarder. Partly because 1) I'd be ashamed to need something and not already have it, and 2) If I use something nice I'm "wasting" it. Also 3) Buying myself stuff is a substitute for closeness and intimacy (not really but I feel like it's the closest I can get.)

My grandmom would always scold me for using things as soon as I got them. If my parents brought me home a movie and we watched it that same day, she'd say "Oh, you should have saved it for a rainy day when you have nothing to do!"

On the other hand, if I DID save something for a later date, she'd say, "Oh, you haven't used that yet? That's bad. Someone spend time and money getting that for you and you don't even appreciate it. I don't know why anyone buys you gifts. You don't deserve them."

ETA: This is all very ironic, considering my username! LOL!

Like many have suggested, liquid meals are a little easier to handle. There's a Planet Smoothie near my house and I go there almost daily (expensive, but worthwhile I feel). Sometimes I'll add protein or other supplements. Ensure and Boost drinks are good to have as well.

<TEXT> I've recently been trying to deal with this issue....I have SO MUCH makeup and a lot of it is just really old at this point, even if it's unopened.

Back in December I noticed one of my eyes was persistently itchy. After a few days I started thinking about my makeup and I realized that I couldn't remember when I had opened my current eyeliner.

It was one of those Estee Lauder refillable ones. The container itself, I'd had since 2008. The actual eyeliner inside was a refill from....2014? 2015? I couldn't remember. Usually I do better at keeping track of when things were opened but I guess with this I didn't bother because it's something I use every day. I stopped using it (but haven't actually thrown it out because they don't make it anymore....which makes no sense? That's my hoarder brain for ya)

And during this pandemic, I haven't worn makeup in about 6 weeks now (with the exception of my birthday). So all the stuff I "stocked up" on before starting my no buy at the start of the year, I'll probably never get to it while it's still good.

Thanks for sharing your story! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Fantastic write up. Hit a lot of marks for me, I am a HSP and recently realized I experienced emotional neglect as a child. You've described it really well. It's so hard trying to explain an experience like this -- the analogy of trying to describe a color others can't see, that's perfect.

Throughout the past decade I've tried affirmations and "positive thinking" and all that sort of thing, and the more I learn about emotional neglect I can see where it won't be enough. I have been researching "tapping" also known as Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) which I think is supposed to release emotions/energy trapped in body meridians, if I'm describing it correctly.

Honestly I am terrified to try and access some of my primal childhood pain; I've been quite depressed most of my life and I've always felt like I'm on the "outside looking in."

Thank you for the book recommendations. I look forward to more of your well-written, insightful posts should you choose to write more. And here's to our continued learning and healing.

First time I drank out of one and noticed this I freaked out but kept it to myself and ended up having a full-blown panic attack. The "cherry on top" was the face tingling that occurred. At the time I didn't know that face tingling (paresthesia) can be part of a panic attack. I thought it was poisoning from the plastic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My grandmom used to do this! It was very subtle, and years before I realized what she was doing. I was shocked when I learned that manners are about making people comfortable and putting them at ease, not about being "right" or "winning" at an interaction. (Although of course the codependent pattern demanded that I still make them comfortable and happy at all times, even while proving I'm "better" because of my behavior. Hard to explain all the nuances but maybe you know what I mean.)

I've met some truly gracious, mannerly people in my life, and they've made me feel lovely, not inadequate. It's mind blowing to meet people who are kind because they truly like you, not because they're "setting you up" for something. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I'm not a mental health expert but what you've described does sound like it could be depression, since you've lost all your hobbies and you aren't interested in anything. Maybe check with a guidance counselor or someone who can help you out and maybe screen you for depression. Get help now, before you go to college because left untreated depression will get 10x worse in college. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes, yes, yes --- I relate so strongly to what you've mentioned! Feeling as though people only like me because they don't know the real me, and if they did they'd disappear, and the feeling trapped in relationships.

And with my boyfriend, I can recall the absolute *terror* I felt the first time he introduced me to someone as his girlfriend and I realized "oh, he's not going to just ghost me, this is a 'thing' now, it has a label and I have to live up to all the unspoken expectations, oh no, oh god what did I get myself into."

Feeling like "I don't want this, but I'm not in a position to turn it down, I don't have the right to refuse it, might as well try to enjoy it while it lasts until he gets tired of me and moves on." Just totally disenfranchised and at the bottom of the "social food chain", so to speak. Relationships feel like a huge responsibility, a tedious and exhausting performance, and so I keep to myself to preserve what little energy I do have.

Sorry for a long reply, what you said just really resonates with me. And you're right, it does help to know that there's a reason for this that doesn't have anything to do with us personally; it's effects of things we've lived through in our formative years. Puts it in perspective. </TEXT>

My "humor" is very nsfw (morbid and dark) so at work I hardly ever smile or laugh or tell jokes. This has led to people trying to make me laugh and bring me out of my shell which causes me intense emotional discomfort but I just sit there and smile and pretend like we're bonding.... </TEXT>

My maternal grandmom was very cruel, controlling, and condescending, and so was/is my mom. Getting a double dose of rejection from them really screwed me up. I'm thankful to have a great relationship with my dad, although he inflicted a small degree of emotional neglect from being a workaholic and minimizing the problems at home (at least in his case it was not intentional or malicious, more of a codependent thing).

"Don't be sad, bud! I'm gonna pray for you!" and went right back to rambling about his life.

Eleven years later and that still fills me with rage. He was always oblivious and tone-deaf but that moment just really took the cake. I cut contact with him a few months later, and occasionally I hear that this asshole still wants to get back in touch with me. HELL TO THE NO

<TITLE> Wondering if emotional neglect is why I feel so cynical about relationships and closeness </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-05-04 08:01:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello Reddit, doing some late night rambling here. I'm wondering if my cynical attitude towards relationships and intimacy is a result of my childhood emotional neglect and the way my parents were with me, and each other. I've put a TL;DR at the bottom.

Within the past few months I've been researching emotional neglect and the effect it has on a person. I quickly recognized that I have experienced it, but I still feel guilty for even looking it up or thinking about it. My mom would hit the roof if she knew I was learning about it.

I was very well provided for in childhood. Medical and dental care, food and water, plenty of clothes, toys, and books, great schools. But emotionally I can see now I was neglected and at times even abused, by my mother and maternal grandmother (maybe a little from my dad, too, although his was not as intentional and malicious. I'm quite close to my dad, or at least as "close" as I can get to someone.)

I have a fearful-avoidant attachment style, and I tend to freeze and fawn. I prefer to fade into the woodwork and not be noticed at all. Boundaries are a huge struggle for me. Intimacy of any kind terrifies me, because I feel like it's a "trap" to start doing what the other person wants.

One of many things I've noticed about myself is how cynical I am about relationships, romantic ones in particular. I've always thought they were a bit of a joke. My parents are still married, but I don't remember them ever seeming like they were "in love." They always slept in different bedrooms and had workaholic tendencies. Very cold and condescending towards each other, and would trash talk each other to me. They seemed like they had to "work around" each other rather than with each other, as a team.

Now as an adult, I find myself rolling my eyes at other peoples' relationships. It's hard for me to believe that people actually care about and love each other, especially people that aren't family members with entrenched codependent patterns. Like, people actually purposefully go out and date and look for someone to spend time with?! Why would you do that? Relationships are such a burden and life is hard enough, why would you add to the drama.

Funnily enough, I was in a relationship for four years. I can't believe it lasted that long. He was a sweet, loving guy. I often felt guilt and anxiety because he much more into it than I was, but me breaking up with him didn't seem like an option. He would talk of marriage, moving in together, and I would "play along" but I never actually believed he wanted those things; I thought he was saying it just to say it or feel like he was fitting in with his friends. It wasn't until a conversation we had not long before he ended things that I realized he was serious -- he did want to spend his life with me, he did really care for me, he wanted the best for me. I was shocked, and it scared me.

We broke up in 2018 and I don't miss him, it's definitely for the best, we wanted such different things in life. But seeing how emotionally invested he was in it was such a surprise to me, and it's partly what led me to start researching attachment styles and now emotional neglect.

I do a little better with friendships, but only if they're okay with minimal contact and keeping the focus on surface level things.

TL;DR: I feel like relationships, especially romantic ones, are a joke and I can't take them seriously. I think this is an effect of emotional neglect in my childhood, and I'm wondering if other people feel the same way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have this problem, too. It's rough. It feels like the food is stuck and like you said, I really have to focus on the mechanism of swallowing. I also have emetophobia so then I start panicking that I'm going to throw up. And of course while all this is going on I have to maintain a conversation and act "normal."

Unfortunately I haven't  found a way to stop this from happening. To alleviate the feeling, I cut my food into tiny pieces and try to chew as thoroughly as I can, and I take frequent small sips of my drink so my mouth doesn't get too dry. (But of course I don't sip too quickly because then I'll get hiccups).

Sending hugs. This phenomenon is definitely one of the most inconvenient things about anxiety. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> One of many reasons I'd never be able to get my own apartment is because of all the pacing I do late at night. My downstairs neighbors would hate me, hahaha!

I could get a ground floor apartment but then I'd constantly worry about someone breaking in and killing me.

Looks like I'll be staying in my childhood bedroom indefinitely!

Of course all of this is a moot point because I'd never be able to afford my own place anyway, maladaptive daydreaming (as well as depression and anxiety) has taken over my life and made me unable to function on most "real life" things other than the bare minimum.

I don't say this to discourage anyone from getting their own apartment. Just wanted to share why I decided long ago it just wouldn't be practical for me, l0lz!

<TEXT> I've spent some time trying this. With me the issue seems to be that I am so detached and uninterested in my "real life" and I can be completely unrealistic in my daydreams. For example, I often play music and imagine myself singing and performing onstage. I have no singing or dancing ability, but it's my favorite daydream to imagine I am talented at these things and that I perform at concerts. If I sang and danced well, you could say I was using my imagination to create my future, or putting energy towards it. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to handle questions about my niece and nephew that aren't related to me </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-04-30 01:52:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My brother passed away last May, and his girlfriend was pregnant. We later found out she was expecting twins, a boy and a girl.

They arrived last December, and they're healthy little ones. However, the bigger they get, the more we're doubting that they're my brother's children. There are numerous reasons we have suspicions, the biggest of which is that their mother hasn't gotten DNA testing for SSI benefits yet. There are many, many other red flags and problems (drug use, etc) going on. All in all, it's been a horrid situation, an elephant in the room that no one will address.

My etiquette question is, how should I handle this if my coworkers ask how the twins are doing? Some of them are well-intentioned but loudmouth, nosy people who will probably spread this around like pollen in the spring time.

 I thought of just saying "Yeah they're doing well!" but as time goes on it looks like we're losing contact with them altogether and I don't know if I can just keep lying about it.

Some of the people I work with, I'm close to, and don't mind telling them the details, and I know they'll be discreet. But the people I'm not close to, I need to figure out what I'm going to say if they ask me about the kids. I'd really rather not get into all the depressing particulars.

So, are there any graceful ways to handle this? </TEXT>

I feel like an idiot because I studied creative writing in college (English major, with creative writing as a concentration) and I have nothing to show for it. Turns out I just wanna live in my head all day, stare at the walls and dissociate. Too bad there's not a major for that, l0lz. </TEXT>

For years, since childhood, I thought I wanted to be a writer because I was always doing this in my head. But when I try to write stories "for real", like sit down and actually do it, it never works and I can't concentrate and I go back to, you guessed it, daydreaming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> [TL;DR at the bottom]

I either don't share enough of myself, or I share too much. I'm very reserved and shy and I feel that if someone got to know the "real me", they'd be disgusted and distance themselves. This frustrates people because they think I'm cold and standoffish, and eventually they give up and more or less stop talking to me.

On the other hand, when I share too much, it's intense and I know I can be super draining to be around.

I have depression as well as anxiety and so I'm not interested in much of anything, I'm too broke to go anywhere, I don't see a point to anything. I'm a proverbial wet blanket. When I'm comfortable with someone (for example, the friend I mentioned in my post, she was one of my teachers in high school and we were very close for a long time because we both struggle with anxiety) I can get to be "too much". I don't know how to balance the "please help me I need support" times with "let's have fun and relax" because I'm so tense and uptight.

TL;DR: I don't think I'm a good friend because I'm just straight up not fun to be around, and I can't balance emotional drama with good times and cheer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! Dealing with something like that at the moment. Last Friday at like 4:30 AM I emailed a friend of mine going on about something I was worried and anxious about and asking her opinion on something. She hasn't answered, which isn't entirely unusual for her, and it's okay if she doesn't want to talk to me, I respect that, but now I'm so, so embarrassed for having sent the email, and twice as anxious as I was originally.

"Reach out to someone!" they said. "It'll help!" they said.

I'm hoping she saw the part where I said "I'll be mentioning this \[situation\] to my therapist tomorrow" and hasn't answered because she figures I can work it out with my therapist. Of course, it's also possible she hates me, and that's okay. I'm not a good friend anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this post is a few days old, but I do this too, it's one of my most common daydreams. I love playing music and pacing and pretending I'm performing. I even do this with raunchy/sexy songs that are so out of character for me (Tove Lo songs, for example)  In "real life" I have no talent for singing and I don't play any instruments. I do love music, though, and will often become obsessed with certain albums. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly! I have to hide my "real self" from everyone, especially at work. No one needs to find out how dark my humor is, how bleak my outlook is, how pervasive my depression is. People always say "Call me anytime! I'm here for you!" But I know if I call them I'll end up listening to them and helping them with their stuff. This makes it so hard to make "real" friends, if such a thing exists. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I wasn't raised atheist, per se, but my parents are definitely skeptical about religion. They sent me to a Christian school for grades K-5 and a Catholic school for grades 6-8 because the public schools in my area are pretty bad.

Anyway, the Christian school had a lot of weird things, like not celebrating Halloween at all (but the Catholic school did, weirdly enough). We had to memorize bible verses and stuff like that. I remember in first grade during our prayer time, we had just seen someone's car on fire in the parking lot, and someone requested to pray for the car. The teacher flipped out and told him, "We never pray for inanimate objects or animals! People only!" and he had to stay in for recess as punishment. I thought that was super harsh, then and now.

Oh, and the Christian school also taught that if you weren't baptized at birth, you were 100% going to hell. So of course my neurotic ass starts panicking and worrying because I was never officially Christened or baptized. My parents offered to do it at the kitchen sink when they saw how upset I was, but I declined because their "spirits don't have the right attitude about it" (basically quoting one of my teachers). So at age 9 I resigned myself to thinking I was going to spend eternity in hell.

Oddly enough, the Catholic school had a more cheerful atmosphere overall. They still had bizarre, persnickety rules to follow, but they seemed to have a better outlook on life at least.

Now as an adult, I'm agnostic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had very similar experiences with Law of Attraction. I feel like it helped for a while, and it did give me belief and motivation to make good things happen in my life, but ultimately I still feel like everything is pointless and meaningless. And trying to pretend otherwise felt really fake and contrived. I look back on old blogs/FB posts from 2008-2011 (back when I was really studying law of attraction and trying to apply) and I cringe because it's so "not me."

Law of Attraction also triggers a lot of guilt and anxiety for me, because I get obsessive and ruminative and start thinking about the past and things that happened and I drive myself crazy thinking about how I "attracted this into my life" and I should "take responsibility for it", etc. My brother committed suicide last May and I'm trying not to start ruminating on how I "attracted that" or "made it happen" because I know it'll cause me to have another nervous breakdown.

So, while I'm glad it's helped and inspired people, for myself, I limit my exposure to it because in my case it causes more harm than good. </TEXT>

<TITLE> How to handle questions about my weight? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-04-23 02:20:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I (28F) have a coworker (mid forties, F) who is very nosy and condescending. She's a rude, childish, self-centered person and very vigilant about her own boundaries, but consistently disrespects other people's.

I've been off from work due to quarantine and I'm thinking about ways to change the dynamic with this coworker. Because she is older than me, she seems to think she can "parent" me and tell me what to do. \[For the record, she's like this with a lot of people.\]  I'd like her to start treating me like an adult instead a four year old, and to have her respect my boundaries. This will require some changes on my part on how I carry myself, and how I respond to her.

One of the (many) things she does is badger me about my weight. I'm 5'6" and about 115 pounds. This coworker will grab me by the shoulders and say, "indulgent\_taurus, you're getting skinny again! Are you losing weight? What do you eat in a day?"

This makes me super uncomfortable, especially because she does it in front of coworkers and customers. I never know what to say, so I stammer something like "Oh, I don't think I've lost any," and she proceeds to criticize me that my clothes look too big, etc.

What can I say if she does this again? I need to firmly say that I don't want to discuss it....is there a "script" I can use?

I don't want to embarrass her in front of coworkers/customers, but then again, she consistently embarrasses me and I'm sick and tired of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My brother (RIP) was 11 years older than me. My parents were actually living apart when they conceived me and they decided to "start over" (they're still together but it hasn't been a happy marriage). Honestly growing up it was like being an only child. My brother left right after high school for the army, and then after that he had his own apartments, etc.

We got along well. But I do agree that it can be selfish or not ideal. My parents worked full time and my grandma looked after us most of the time. By the time my brother was in high school he had part time jobs and would be out most of the time. He did look after me sometimes if our grandma went somewhere, I have fond memories of ordering a pizza and watching movies with him one day. I wonder what his perspective on it would be?

Sorry for rambling, his birthday is today and I'm struggling a bit.

My parents were also a little "older" when they had me: Mom was 38 turning 39, and Dad was 39 turning 40. My mom has confessed to me that she worried about being around long enough to take care of me into adulthood.

In general, I do think it's kinda selfish to have kids with such huge age gaps, especially if the older children are expected to look after the younger ones. This also happens a lot with very religious fundie families. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Good question....there's a blog called "Biblical Gender Roles" that goes in depth with a lot of this stuff, but as far as I know it's run by one man so it's all his interpretations and views. Lots of articles on different kinds of sex, consent, etc. (I've even wondered if this guy is an elaborate troll, tbh) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for this! We're about the same age and I've been thinking a lot about how relieved I am to have more of a "choice" about friendships now, it's not like in school days.

In particular I relate the the interrupting and rude comments -- last year I was spending time with someone who would do those things in particular, and it drove me up the wall. When she mentioned that she was moving, it was like a light bulb went off in my head and I realized "Hey I don't have to do this anymore." We grew apart naturally and I don't hear from her anymore. And I've learned that I don't have to tolerate draining friendships I don't really click with. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Missing my brother on his birthday. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-04-22 10:38:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Having a rough time at the moment. My brother committed suicide last year (May 27) and today, April 22, is his birthday. He would have been 40. My birthday is April 25 (I'll be 29).

I feel so lonely (rare for me, thanks to extreme introversion combined with avoidant attachment). I miss my brother so very much. I'd give anything just to hug him one more time.

He struggled with alcoholism for much of his adult life, and lived far enough away that to visit he'd need to take the train (he stopped driving sometime in his mid 20's). He would never give us a specific address as to wear he lived, just "downtown" or "near the sports complex" something like that. So we didn't see him often. He would disappear sometimes, we'd get worried, then he'd pop back up on social media. He was in jail off and on. He always seemed to "land on his feet" so to speak, was well liked at his jobs as far as we knew. Pretty secretive about his life.

His girlfriend was pregnant and gave birth to twins in December but, as time goes on we have reason to believe they aren't my brother's children. (He'd always said he was sterile because of something that happened to him in the army.) So, there's another potential roller coaster and elephant in the room. I'm not mad if they aren't his. Just exhausted at this point.

My parents are getting older and that makes me sad. I notice the liver spots on my dad's hands, and the crepey skin on my mother's forearms, and it makes me want to cry. I miss my childhood, my brother, the pets I've had over the years, old school friends I haven't heard from in years. I feel intense guilt because I feel like I didn't appreciate things enough when I was a child/adolescent, and now I'm a barely functioning, borderline recluse adult with no real direction in life. (Side note: I have depression and anxiety, currently working with a therapist).

I keep thinking about one of the last times I saw him, he was getting out of our dad's truck at the train station and about to shut the truck door and he said "Watch your fingers," just like when I was little and he would look after me. I remember the time I was about 5 years old with my first bicycle and zooming down the driveway, him running to the end of it to catch me (I didn't know how to use the brakes). He took me to see the first Harry Potter movie when it came out. I remember all the gifts he would get me for Christmas, the jewelry box I still have.

Basically I'm feeling an intense, although not unexpected, surge of grief right now. Mixed with the grief and sense of loss is nostalgia for the past, wishing I'd appreciated things more, feeling sad that I've spent so much time and energy on things that don't matter to me. One good thing about quarantine is that I've had time to refocus and reprioritize. If there's a silver lining to grief, it's that it can remind us what really matters, and encourages us to focus on what really matters.

ACB, I miss you so very much. I hope you know I much I love you. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The Pick-Up Truck </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-04-17 00:49:01 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This happened in February or March 2005. I was 13, almost 14 years old. I used to take my dog Mitzi for walks around the neighborhood. Usually these walks were peaceful and without incident.

I remember on this day, must have been a weekend, it had been cloudy all morning but then the sun came out full force in the afternoon and I decided to take Mitzi out so we could enjoy it together.

We went our usual route. At one point I could hear a vehicle behind me and it sounded like it was slowing down. I looked around and noticed a filthy old pickup truck with two middle-aged men in it. They were driving super slow and staring at me.

Being the overly polite and agreeable person that I am, I smiled at them. \[Side note: for years afterwards I wondered if I'd "enticed" these men by smiling. Yay guilt complex!\] They smiled back and the guy in the passenger seat rolled down the window and said, "Heeeeey girl."

At this point I realized my mistake of smiling and simply nodded and picked up my walking pace a little. The guys in the truck beeped at me, which made me jump and I could hear their laughter from the open window as they sped up and drove away. The passenger seat guy stuck his whole head out the window and grinned/laughed at me, giving me a "thumbs up."

I felt unsettled, but it seemed like the men were driving away, and I figured we were okay.

So, the neighborhood is set up with "loops" and cul-de-sacs. Basically big circles. On this particular loop, Mitzi and I usually walked it three times. Since I thought these guys had left, I figured it was probably safe to walk it again.

HAHAHA NOPE. Who do I hear creeping up behind me again, but the two men. They drove real slow again, just staring at me. I was so nervous I simply stood still and watched them, making uneasy eye contact. They drove away and Mitzi and I started walking again, this time planning to head straight home.

So I'm heading towards a different street and the men drive past me a third time. By now I'm thoroughly creeped out and getting scared. I was afraid to walk to my street because I didn't want them to know where I live. They honked their horn again and I refused to look at them, trying to hold my head high and appear confident.

When they drove away this time, I stood at the corner, breathing heavily and trying not to panic. Thankfully, I saw one of my next-door neighbors walking. I called out to her and we walked together and I told her what happened. We walked around looking, but we didn't see the truck again. She was very reassuring and told me to call her if I needed her.

It was a long, long time before I went for another walk with Mitzi by ourselves. Even now as an adult, still living in the same neighborhood I get nervous sometimes.

<TEXT> With quarantine I've been diving deep into my drawers and closets and finding lots of items I'm willing to let go of, which is a miracle in and of itself. Most of these are clothes (the books I'll be taking to 2nd and Charles when they reopen).

Most of these items are brand new with tags, and were safely stored in a Rubbermaid bin for a few years. While I have no problem donating, I'm wondering if it's worth selling things online, or does that just add to the hoard?

I have a hard time with keeping up and following through with things, and I'm thinking if I take the time to take pictures of all the stuff, upload it, post it on Ebay or wherever, and then have to figure out what kind of package to ship it in, etc....I can see this quickly becoming another "good intentions" type of thing that just buries me in more clutter (even if it's mental stress).

So, I figured I'd check in with my fellow hoarders/recovering hoarders: anyone here had any success with selling online, or did it just create more clutter and stress? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Last night a coworker I'm friends with texted me, saying, "are you up for a phone call?" I was, and we chatted for three hours! It was great. We always talk at work, but we're never able to go in-depth or have a nice long heartfelt discussion because we have to interact with customers and stuff.

It was so, so good to talk to her. I can't remember the last time I talked on the phone for "fun" purposes.

After we hung up, though, I noticed that I felt *exhausted* and I fell asleep immediately afterwards. Idk if that's because it's been a couple of weeks since I've really talked to anyone except my parents (and therapist via webchat) and my "social muscles" are going flabby or what. LOL

I'm still really glad I talked to my friend, and I feel closer to her. It's just funny how even a phone call can take a lot out of us introverts! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had this book in middle school and only read maybe 1/3 of it. I liked it, just never actually finished it for some odd reason. The cover was dark blue/black and had a girl's frightened face and a dollhouse prominently featured.

Every time I try to look it up, "Dollhouse Murders" by Betty Ren Wright comes up (which is a fantastic book, I actually have it c/o from library right now, and it's what prompted me to try and find this other book). A similar story but not the one I'm thinking of.

Now that I think of it, Betty Ren Wright may be the author of this book? But I can't find a book by her that matches what I remember. Maybe it was an author inspired by her. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, seeking reassurance is one of many things I struggle with when dealing with my OCD tendencies. I hate that I'm like this because it gets excessive and I wish I could stop but once I'm on a roll I just keep going. I don't like how this makes me appear, I feel like I put a lot of effort into seeming "relatively normal and carefree" and I end up revealing too much of myself.

Went to the dentist the other day for my six month checkup and it went pretty well, but anything dental/medical has become really triggering and upsetting for me in recent years. I found myself asking tons of questions and I could feel myself getting "weird" but I couldn't help it, I just wanted answers to things, and the hygienist was really kind and patient. But she could tell I was nervous and getting a little worked up and she said "It'll be fine, honey. Don't worry."

Afterwards, in my car, I got really upset because I was doing my best to seem like a calm, rational person who's just trying to be an "informed consumer" but YET AGAIN I revealed too much and came off like an obsessive weirdo with nothing better to do than research different brands of floss and toothpaste. I try to present myself in a confident manner, but the façade always disintegrates and I end up rambling on and on and coming off as "sad and pathetic, thus easily tricked and taken advantage of."

I'm worried that because people can tell I'm shaky and scared and need reassurance that they'll use this against me somehow and "trick" me. I feel trapped in a scary, hateful world full of vengeful people and that no one can be trusted. I know how paranoid that sounds but lately my OCD has had a really strong grip on me and it's been rough.

TL;DR: I wish I could stop asking people so many questions or at least do so in a more confident manner. I come off like a scared, uncertain person and I don't like that people think this about me. They treat me "gently" and that makes me self conscious.  I want to appear as an "informed consumer" and not the obsessive weirdo I really am. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The days are slowly getting longer, and today in particular the weather is very nice: about 65 degrees and sunny. I have my bedroom window open and I'm enjoying the sunlight.

The depressing thing though is that these longer sunny days really highlight how messy my hoard is. I mean I knew this, it's not a surprise, but it's really sobering to see it in the natural light. The teetering piles of books, the stacks of unopened mail, the dust, the stale air (thank goodness for the fresh air coming in via the window). I also have carpet beetles, so, yeah that's fun. \[Side note: Anyone know how to get rid of those? Moth balls or something? Once I have enough floor space I'm going to start vacuuming regularly again and I know that will help keep them at bay.\]

I'm thinking I'll use these longer days as motivation to make some progress with cleaning up and letting things go. I did okay last year but then "slacked off" by the end of the summer. Time to get back "on the wagon," so to speak. On the bright side, I've done well with buying fewer items since the new year, so there's that.

....Here we go again! Best of luck to anyone else getting back into a hoard clean up. </TEXT>

<DATE> 2019-12-28 05:25:09 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Had my last therapy appointment today, at least for a while. My therapist's contract didn't get renewed, so she is in the process of looking for another job. The therapy office offered to transition me to a new therapist, but I'm going to wait and see where my current therapist ends up so I don't have to start over with someone new.

Then I went to Wal-Mart for "just makeup remover and foundation" …..and came out with $70 worth of stuff. It's all stuff I use on a daily basis, "restocks" if you will, but 95% I did NOT need to get right now. It could have waited. As I was leaving the store I felt that familiar tight, fluttery feeling in my chest.

I'm considering returning some of the stuff. But the hoarder/shopping addict in me is like "Just keep it because you'll use it eventually." But I'm angry with myself for buying more than I told myself I would. And I need to be careful with money right now because I haven't had as many hours due to the holidays, etc.

So, all this considered, it's definitely time for a no-buy in 2020. For cosmetics and toiletries I'll be doing a "replacement only" no-buy, with a limit of one unopened backup for each item. I'm working on refining my rules for other categories. I feel pretty scatterbrained right now and kind of panicky, so I'm going to get some rest and work on this tomorrow, write up a short contract for myself.

I'm also going to start the no-buy on tomorrow's date, instead of waiting for January 1. Normally I'm very weird and particular about certain dates and will wait until New Year's/my birthday/etc to start something new but when it's in the middle of the week like it is this year, it feels like it's hard to get the momentum going, or something. That might not make any sense, IDK.

Anyway, I'm rambling. Just wanted to get this off my chest. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Feeling anxious and awkward when people give me gifts </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-12-18 16:34:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> DAE feel shy/awkward about when people give you gifts? I always feel like I'm not showing my gratitude enough. I feel like they'll think I don't like the gift, or that I am not gracious. It's especially awkward in person, because I hate being the center of attention and people watching me open things. Being given something in private is easier because I have time to plan my reaction.

For example, a dear friend/coworker just gave me an adorable owl necklace and a sweet note. She left it on my desk, so I was alone when I opened it. I teared up a little with happiness/thankfulness and then immediately got nervous- how should I thank her? Should I approach her, or let her come to me first? If I don't find her myself to thank her, will she think I'm not excited about it? But on the other hand, if I approach her in front of someone to thank her for a gift, is that a faux pas if she didn't get the other person something?

I decided on wearing the necklace right away, as it does match my outfit today, and this was good because she came over and saw I was wearing it and we hugged and I thanked her and it was good so I feel like I "did it right". (Now of course I'm anxious again because I can't afford to get her anything in return, but that's another story).

I'm pretty sure this stems from childhood- my grandmom and mom were always very manipulative about gift giving. Things they gave me always had "strings attached" and a lot of emotional weight that always took the joy out of it. And if I didn't use the item quickly, they'd accuse me of not liking it, of not liking them, etc. So now I have a fear people not believing my gratitude is real. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Retrospective & Thinking Ahead for 2020 </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> As 2019 closes out I'm starting to think about my goals for 2020 and most of those goals relate to budgeting and dealing with my shopping addiction. This is just me sort of thinking out loud, if this kind of post isn't allowed please remove it.

At the end of November, my therapist told me she just found out that her contract didn't get renewed. Her final day at the practice is December 31, 2019. So, we've only got two sessions left. The practice has offered to transition me to a new therapist, but I'm not sure if I want to.  I'm very attached to my current therapist and we work well together. I'm still adjusting to the sudden news of her contract ending. I *really* don't feel like starting over with someone else. My therapist is very rattled by it, too, and is working on finding a new practice or maybe opening her own. She has my contact info and said she'll let me know when she gets settled somewhere else.

Overall I'm doing "okay" with my compulsive shopping. Not great, but not terrible either. My monthly student loan payment just went through today and I've got a credit card bill looming over my head, so those factors have motivated me to "behave" these past few weeks.

I don't even know what budget/shopping goals to set for 2020. With such a deep-rooted, compulsive behavior it's almost like I'm just going to have to take it day by day, moment by moment. If I set really ambitious "no-buys" I get anxious and end up going overboard. But giving myself reasonable "budgets" for stuff that I want (books, makeup, etc) gets me into trouble too because I can't stick to the rules I set. I feel very untrustworthy with myself.

2019 was tough. My brother passed away in May and his girlfriend just gave birth to their twins last week. I'm glad the twins are here, but it's so bittersweet and emotional because my brother isn't here for it. Lesser concerns include  my carpal tunnel and my usual mental health issues. I often feel tired, anxious, hopeless, which in turn makes me feel like saying "fuck it" and just buying a ton of stuff. On the bright side, I got a small promotion at my job earlier this year, and I have caring, supportive friends and coworkers. So that's good. (No word yet on that full time job I interviewed for a few weeks ago).

TL;DR: Feeling okay but sort of lost, unsure of what goals to make for 2020 concerning budgeting and no-buys. I'd like to see my behavior change for the better but I don't trust myself at all. Also worried about losing my current therapist, even if it may be only temporary. </TEXT>

I did yoga, took a luxurious hot shower, and washed all of my bedding. I don't get to wash my bedding as often as I should because my mom gets mad when I use the washer/dryer (she's a hoarder with control issues) and so when I do laundry, I usually only have time for my clothes.

Then I made macaroni and cheese (the Annie's brand from a box, one of my favorite comfort foods) and now I'm feeling clean and cozy and comfy in my favorite jam-jams with clean sheets as a bonus. I feel so good right now. <3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> Today I went to a baby shower for my sister-in-law. I went with my parents and we met a lot of my sister-in-law's family for the first time. I was pretty nervous, but overall it was a good time and I felt fairly relaxed. As everyone was getting ready to leave, one of her aunts said to me, "All you do is just smile constantly! It's just too cute!" I laughed awkwardly and looked away.

It upset me a little because I do smile a lot, too much probably, and it's out of fear. I feel like a vacuous, empty-headed person in social situations, and I just smile and hope no one talks to me or asks difficult questions. I wish I could be more "normal" and not be so caught up in this pathetic people-pleasing persona I have. </TEXT>

Wednesday morning I have an interview for a full-time library assistant position. I'm currently a part-time circulation, computer, and children's aide. I have almost 5 year's experience with the job I'm in now, and ten years total library experience (my high school job and volunteering, etc).

I'm just doing some preparation and wanted to know if there are any common questions that come up for this type of interview? I've been told by colleagues that the questions usually focus on customer service and knowledge of library policies and software.

I'm mostly concerned if they ask questions about "tell a time when you provided leadership to other staff" because as a part-timer that hasn't really been an issue; although I've helped train new staff and answer questions if people ask. I don't really think of myself as a leader, though, so I'll have to work on showing confidence in my knowledge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> ....Surprise, surprise. I mean I always want to buy stuff but right now I'm really struggling because:

1) This interview is for a full-time job in my field and I'd have more money, which is good, but I'm scared I'll just dig myself into a deeper hole. I don't manage the money I have now very well, so why should I earn more? I have no self-control. I almost wish someone else controlled my finances and just gave me an allowance, as pathetic as that sounds.

2) I'm really, really anxious. My whole body is shaking and I have a whole week to go before the interview. So I'm tempted to buy stuff because that's my favorite way to self-soothe. But I shouldn't, because it's so destructive. But I'm so damn scared and overstimulated and I can't think straight.

I'm doing my best to distract myself from online shopping right now, which is tough because I'm working at a computer for the next couple of hours. My plan is to look at cute animals on Reddit. If things get really rough I might grab a coloring sheet from our art supplies and try that out.

When I get home I'm going to self-soothe with food, which isn't healthy either but is a better option than shopping. I'm going to get a smoothie from my favorite place and drink it really slowly, enjoy it, maybe have some popcorn with it and watch a movie. A chill, lo-fi kind of night.

My next therapy appointment is Friday.

Looking back over this post, I realize I sound like a drama queen, but I feel better for having expressed my thoughts. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Yet Another Wake-Up Call </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-10-21 22:45:12 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I saw my therapist on Friday and we were talking about my usual struggles with shopping and hoarding (this particular week, we're having a DVD/CD sale at work and it's been really hard for me not to go overboard....$1 dvds and 50 cent CDs) and she asked me something that really surprised me.

"Do you think you have a shopping addiction?" she said.

The question floored me. Honestly I thought we'd already established that I have an addiction, and it's the main reason I'm in therapy. But the fact that she is just now coming around to calling it an addiction makes me wonder why she thought it was any different.

I'm a people pleaser and I tend to sugar coat everything, especially bad news about myself. So I'm thinking maybe all this time I've been in therapy, she didn't realize how serious the shopping addiction was, because I frame it in a "haha isn't this funny, I'm such a shopaholic, L-O-L, please don't make me talk about how fucking depressed and angry I am" sort of way.

I hesitated to answer the question, and she asked me things like, "Have you ever been able to not get food because you bought other things?" (Yes) and I also told her how I've been wanting to get my hair cut for a month now but haven't been able to because I keep buying other stuff. (Planning to go this Friday, for real this time).

So, now that she and I are both on the same page that it's an addiction, she said that we're going to start approaching this in a different way.

I'm nervous, and I feel like I've "let her down," but maybe I'll finally start making some progress. It was embarrassing to have this discussion, but also a relief. Let's not pretend anymore, let's stop pretending like I'm going to be able to set a budget and stick to it. I'm a shopping addict, I have a serious problem, I'm grappling with deep-seated emotional issues, and I need help. </TEXT>

<TITLE> My hoarder brain makes no sense.... </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-10-10 01:57:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm a hoarder with OCD tendencies and I tend to acquire multiples of the same item. I also "personify" items and it feels like certain things have "spirits" or human qualities.

So, I work at a library and have access to a back room where we store weeded books and donations. As you can probably guess, this is a treasure trove for me- I'm a hoarder, I love books, and these books are FREE. Staff members can take what they like and the rest is sold in our book sale or given to Better World Books.

Recently our call number section 158 was weeded. 158 is the call number for self-help and emotional health books, my favorite genres. So yesterday, when I saw an *entire cart* of discards from this section, my hoarder brain went WILD.

In particular, I saw a title *Making Work Work for the Highly Sensitive Person* by Barrie S. Jaegar. This is a fantastic book. I know this because I've borrowed the library copy a few times and eventually bought my own copy, and referred to it often a couple of years ago. I know I still have the copy I bought, but I don't know where it is. It's in my room somewhere, probably buried under hundreds of other purchases at this point. So here's the conversation I had with myself when I saw the discarded library's copy sitting on the cart:

My Brain: You love that book! Take it!

Me: But we bought our own copy, remember?

Brain: Yes, but you don't know where it is!

Me: That's because our room is a mess. If we cleaned up and got rid of stuff we'd come across it eventually.

Brain: But this copy is right here in front of you! JUST TAKE IT!

Me: No. Just because we can't find something doesn't justify getting another one. We're leaving.

Ten Minutes Later on the Car Ride Home:

Brain: Don't you feel guilty, though? It's probably getting weeded because you bought a copy and stopped borrowing that one, so its circulation numbers dropped and now they decided to get rid of it. That book helped you a lot and now it's probably your fault it's getting discarded.

Me: Oh shit, good point! I'll get it tomorrow.

But alas, when I came into work today that particular cart had already been emptied into the Better World Books bin. These bins are huge and it would almost impossible to find it at this point. So, I'm going to have to let it go. Which is fine, because this is good motivation for me to clean up and *find the copy I already own.*

WHY AM I LIKE THIS, THOUGH. I feel like all my energy is spent talking myself into, out of, and then back into acquiring stuff. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Bought a lot of fragrances and now I can't really use them </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> If anyone here needs encouragement to not "hoard" and stock up on the latest thing you're fixated on, here's an example:

So in 2018 I decided I needed a "signature scent" for perfume and for a couple of months bought a whole bunch of sample vials and full bottles. I did find some scents I really like, but it takes *a very long time* to finish even a sample size (I only wear 1 spray at a time).

Last week the library system I work for implemented a state-wide "fragrance free workplace" policy. It makes sense, many people are sensitive to perfumes and stuff, so that's fine. (And I sincerely hope no one was ever bothered by mine).

But damn now I'm never gonna use up all the perfume I bought! Why couldn't I just be a "reasonable human" and buy a couple of things instead of a whole bunch of stuff at once (and spent a lot of money). I get obsessed, buy a whole bunch of something, and then move on to the next thing and the cycle continues. It's madness. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Goals for September </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-09-04 16:41:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I got an "extra" paycheck in August (not really extra, but the way the weeks fell, there were 3 in a month so it feels like it is) and decided to be wise with it. I just paid my car insurance with my credit card and the new statement will be reflected on my October bill, so, I'm abstaining from shopping to give myself a cushion for that increased minimum payment.

I'm taking this just two weeks at a time, because in the past when I think "no more shopping for X amount of months" I get panicky and it backfires. My basic guidelines are:

1) No Starbucks (slid back into the habit and I need to escape it)

2) No "recreational" shopping (this includes all my problem areas: books, music, movies, clothes and accessories).

Potential pitfalls include:

1) Working the computer area at work. This gives me lots of "window shopping" time, so I'll need to be proactive and bring other things to do. Perhaps I'll work on some long-neglected writing projects, or read a PDF book.

2) The new Tove Lo album comes out on September 20, I believe. I may allow myself to buy this since I've been really looking forward to it and I love music so much. We'll see. That's a little ways off so I'm putting it out of my mind for now. Reminding myself to just think of this in two-week stretches to make it more manageable.

Went over this with my therapist last week and she agrees it's a good plan. I'm off to a great start and was able to side-step all the Labor Day sales. Hopefully once I've got some momentum going it'll inspire me to stick to it.

Sending out vibes of self-control and mindfulness to all my fellow shopping addicts out there! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been feeling wound up this week and it's been really hard to resist overshopping. I've given in to the urge many times. This will probably be a very long and rambling post, and for that, I apologize. My mind is all over the place and I'm trying to clear my head. I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom.

I had a dentist appointment on Monday, my first in 2 years. It went well and it feels good to have my teeth cleaned up, I do feel a bit better about myself. I'm nervous, though, because the dentist wants to redo one of my fillings because of its "discoloration" (this honestly sounds like bullshit but whatever) and I'm getting a small spot restored on another tooth. They didn't even notice this spot until I pointed it out to them, which troubles me. I wish they were more detail oriented. I do have insurance but I'm worried about paying for what isn't covered. Maybe I can postpone the replacement filling? I might ask about doing that.

All week at work I was buying lots of things on ebay, because I was still "up" and jumpy about the dentist.

Today the new Taylor Swift album came out, yay! And I went to Target to get one of the deluxe editions. I had planned to take the bus there, since I hate driving to the mall, but I got on the express bus instead and ended up downtown. So I had to get the bus back towards where I live, and this one didn't stop at the mall either (I now realize I misread the schedule). After all that I ended up driving to the mall myself anyway. It was fine, a nice easy drive. I got the album and then, of course, my dumb ass decided to go to Barnes and Noble. WHY do I do this to myself? I got the new Joshilyn Jackson book I've been wanting (could've just ordered it from Amazon, or better yet get on the hold list at the library) and at check-out the cashier convinced me to renew my mom's Barnes and Noble account so I could get \~extra savings\~. I feebly tried to explain to her that I don't really go to bookstores that often, but in the end she won, with her cheery smile and "soothing, knowledgeable grandmother" aura. I feel like an absolute idiot. (It costs $25 to renew a Barnes and Noble membership. I did save 50% on the book, but would have been cheaper to not renew the account and just buy it full price).

WHY am I so silly, and stupid, and easily swayed? WHY did I not just go straight home after Target? WHY did I think I could handle being in a book store? God I'm so dumb. I'm not getting better at all. I'm just as addicted to shopping, and gullible, and weak-minded as I've always been. I have no mind of my own and I shouldn't be allowed to handle money. Really struggling with intense self-hatred right now.

TL;DR - Have been feeling really anxious, hyper, jittery, and wound up all week long and it's making me want to shop more than usual. I feel crazy and out of control. I have an appointment with my therapist later today, so I'll be discussing these feelings with her and getting her insights. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've been feeling particularly irritable the past few days. One of the "upsides" to feeling angry is that it means I have less tolerance for clutter. Some of my best clean-outs have been fueled by pent-up rage.

My bedroom has a stale smell to it, probably from all the clutter and the window not being opened much. The whole "vibe" of this room is just....*tired.* Tired, dusty, cluttered, run-down, overwhelmed. This morning I tripped over one of my piles of books for the millionth time and something in me just snapped: "This is it, I can't take it anymore." I got a large trash bag and started throwing away things that were obvious garbage (take out containers, water bottles, receipts, etc). Then I boxed up a whole bunch of books for donation. Most of these were used books I bought at the book sale at work, cheap paperbacks and stuff like that. In my fed-up state, it was easy for me to decide "To hell with it, they've been sitting here for months and I haven't once look at any of them." I also ripped all the bedding off my bed and threw it in the wash (a brave move considering my overbearing control freak mother is home today, and she hates when I use the washer and dryer, but to hell with her! I need clean sheets, damn it!)

It's now a few hours later and I've calmed down a bit. I still have piles of clutter, but there's a bare spot where that one pile of books was, and it makes me so happy to look at it! It's a little easier to open my closet door now. I took a shower and I'm sipping some juice and savoring this bit of progress. It's not much, but it's something, and I feel like I used my anger for something constructive, instead of just stewing in it.

ETA: Wow, thanks for the gold, kind stranger! :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Buying Nostalgia Makeup </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-08-11 20:44:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I was thinking about the very first makeup items I ever used, and was reminded of my first eyeshadows.

I turned 13 in 2004 and this was when my mom started letting me wear makeup (only around the house, as it wasn't permitted at my Catholic school). For Easter that year I got a CoverGirl gift set with a single eyeshadow and a lip gloss, both in the shade "Pink Chiffon." In June 2004, I remember getting a Covergirl 3-pan eyeshadow called "Cafe Au Lait".

I found out that CoverGirl still makes the Cafe Au Lait, and I bought one the other day. (I don't think "Pink Chiffon" is manufactured anymore, although I could probably find one on ebay.)

Did I need it? Hell no.

However, the shades in it are safe beige neutrals which are my favorite for everyday. I bought it for both nostalgic and practical purposes. Feels like I've come "full circle" with makeup, starting out with really light natural colors, then goth makeup in high school, smoky eyes in college, and now back to basics.

I shouldn't make this a habit, though. Just because I have fond memories of something and it looks good on me, *does not mean I need to buy it.* I let my feelings get the best of me and convince me to buy things when a logical, frugal approach would be best. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Just wanted a bottle opener </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So frustrated. Earlier today I (28F) had this interaction with my hoarder mom (66F):

Me: I opened a kitchen drawer looking for a bottle opener for my soda. It was a struggle to open it because it's crammed full of things, and several items fell to the floor while I looked through it all.

Mom: (approaching quickly, hovering anxiously): What are you looking for?

Me: Do we have a bottle opener?

Mom: I don't know. Maybe in one of my spare rooms. I don't want you going in there though. You just want to go through my things. (We have two spare bedrooms, both filled with her stuff, as well as most of the rest of the house)

Me: Not really....just wanted a bottle opener. (I tried to be neat but more things were falling out of the drawer).

Mom: Why do you need one anyway? For aLc0h0l? You shouldn't be drinking Alc0h0l! We have alC0h0lic genes in this family!

Me: Just a soda....

Mom: Well you shouldn't be drinking that either!

Me: Nevermind….

I started to pick up the items but my mom said "No, just let me do it, they need to be washed now anyway, just get out of the kitchen."

While her back was turned I snuck the soda upstairs and opened it with my house key. This whole thing was so ridiculous. I'm 28 years old, if I want a goddamn soda, I'll drink a goddamn soda! Makes me so mad that I'm in a position where she still talks to me like I'm 10 years old. I hate that I've allowed this weird, hateful, codependent relationship to continue this far into my adulthood. I had hoped I'd have cut her off by now.

I'm far from innocent, relationships are a two-way street. In fact, I myself have hoarding tendencies and a shopping addiction. Just sharing this for any teens/young adults who may be living with hoarders. Make plans to move out and have your own space. Staying there will arrest your development. I am living proof of this. </TEXT>

<TITLE> The time I had a panic attack during a therapy session </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-08-04 01:07:17 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This happened yesterday. Everything was fine and then BAM! I started getting panicky. For me panic attacks always feel like I'm choking and/or like I might throw up. I have a phobia of throwing up, so feeling like I might get sick intensifies the panic, and it goes on and on in a vicious cycle. I also felt clammy and lightheaded and slightly dizzy.

My mind went blank and I had a really hard time concentrating on what we were talking about. I was super fidgety and kept touching my hair. I'm pretty sure my therapist knew something was up.

I don't know why I didn't tell her that I was having a panic attack? I think part of me couldn't believe that it was happening, it was so ironic. We weren't talking about anything particularly upsetting or triggering. It came out of nowhere, like it always does.

I felt better after the session, and was even able to manage a trip to the grocery store.

Next week I might tell her what happened, but I feel embarrassed about it. I know that's kinda silly, she's my therapist after all, but I'm worried she'll think it was something she did or said that caused it because it definitely wasn't- just my nervous system being idiotic and overreactive.

So, yeah. Panic attacks suck! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Dealing with repressed rage </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-08-03 12:13:52 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I've often heard that depression is anger turned inward, and in my case I'd say that's pretty accurate.

It's 5:58AM and I've been up all night because I'm too angry to sleep. Every time I try to fall asleep, I start thinking of the people/situations I'm angry about and I get riled up all over again. So I get up, pace around, throw pillows at the wall (I want to throw "harder" things but I don't want to wake my parents up), rehearse "tell-offs" and showdowns in my head that I know will never happen.

Most of my rage is directed towards my mother. We've never had a good relationship. Too much stuff to put in one post but basically she's a toxic energy vampire and drags me down and suffocates me. She's passive aggressive, manipulative, and emotionally abusive. She disgusts me. My lifelong issues with being unassertive and unable to have satisfying relationships with other people stem from my dysfunctional relationship with mom (and grandmom, too, who had the same personality and lived with us. She passed away in 2015). Thankfully, my relationship with my dad is good.

I've gotten so good at repressing my emotions and being "nice" that I don't realize how angry I am until I'm alone. I have to constantly distract myself with movies/TV/YouTube, food, compulsive shopping, etc. because otherwise I get consumed in my anger. It feels like heat and electricity coursing through my body. Once it was so intense I was literally brought to my knees. It's like a panic attack, but with anger instead.

I saw my therapist yesterday and I tried to explain my repressed rage to her, but I don't know if she understood the full extent of it.

Clearly I need an outlet for this anger. It feels "stuck" in my body. If I could process it somehow, then maybe my depression would let up a little. I don't think confronting anyone would really help. I'd probably just make myself look really unstable and "crazier" than I already am; especially since a lot of the stuff I'm angry about happened years ago. But I can't keep repressing this. Maybe if I improved my everyday communication skills or something? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Man on the Bus </TITLE>
<DATE> 2019-08-02 09:37:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This happened in June 2010. I was 19 and taking summer classes at my college and I used to take the bus downtown. I'd encounter all sorts of people on my bus rides but this one stays with me for some reason.

So one morning I'm on the bus and it's pretty empty. A skinny, middle-aged man got on about halfway through my ride. I felt him looking at me pretty intensely, so I made a point of avoiding eye contact. This in itself wasn't too weird; I'd gotten good at avoiding talking to strange men.

In my peripheral vision, I noticed that this man kept switching seats every few minutes, working his way closer to me. Finally he landed in a seat in front of me and turned around. "Hello," he said. I remember he had dark shadows under his eyes, and he smelled of pencil shavings.

"Hi," I said cautiously, half expecting him to start hitting on me. Instead, he launched into a long, intense talk about the end of the world, angels and demons, God and Satan, etc. The way he spoke reminded me of my professors giving a lecture- it seemed almost rehearsed, like he'd given this talk many times.

He would get excited and start gesturing, and then look around and lower his voice, leaning his face close to me. I mostly just nodded politely. Then he suddenly looked up and said, "Here's my stop, we'll continue this tomorrow," and got off.

This continued for about two weeks- he'd get on at the same stop, sit near me, and give me a detailed lecture about demons, and numerology, and end times, and how the "whole world is gonna fall apart, and all these people care about is their Starbucks" and stuff like that. He never even told me his name, or asked for mine.

I felt weirded out, but honestly, I'd experienced worse, and he wasn't flirting with me, so I just let it continue. I figured he had a mental illness or something.

The last bus ride I saw him, he hardly spoke at all. He sat in front of me like usual, but didn't lecture. Instead he just wrote something on a piece of paper and right before he got off, handed it to me. I've long since lost it but it said something to the effect of"This bus is bugged, I can't look out for you anymore. I have to disappear. Stay safe."

Now this was really, really creepy, especially since I didn't see him anymore after that, but again, I chalked it up to either extreme eccentricity or a mental illness.

Two years later, in 2012: It was a bright, clear autumn day. I was on campus and had just stepped out of a coffee shop and was on my way to my next class. I walked past a bus stop, which was near a crosswalk. While waiting for the light I was looking around and saw him, the same man. He smiled slightly, and saluted me. I smiled back and then thankfully the light changed and I was able to cross the street. That was the last time I ever saw him.

Okay now that I've written this I'm realizing that it's really not that exciting or "out there," but I hope it was at least mildly interesting! I'll have to think about some of the other creepy encounters I've had on public transit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So, yesterday I just bought two mascaras I've been wanting to try for awhile (Maybelline Great Lash & Maybelline Lash Sensational). I have 3 other mascaras I need to use first, but I finally gave in and bought these Maybelline ones because I've wanted them for a few years now.

Part of me is really excited that I'm finally going to try these products, and part of me is disappointed that I added yet more stuff to my stash.

I only use one mascara at a time, for 4 months, so I use 3 mascaras every year.

My favorite is Covergirl LashBlast, but haven't bought it in a while because I was working my way through some deluxe samples and "free gift with purchase" stuff. As of right now, with the new purchases I have 5 unopened mascaras. A lot less than I used to have, but still a lot.

The "free gift" mascaras are ones I'm not particularly "excited" about using, whereas with the Maybelline ones I'm really stoked to try them out. So maybe I'll just give away the ones I'm not excited about? But what if I try them and really like them and hate the Maybelline ones? I know I'm really overthinking this.

"It's only drugstore, you didn't spend much" I keep telling myself, but still, I need to be saving money, not spending it. I don't know why I can't just wait until I actually need a product before stocking up on it. (Actually, I do: I'm worried it'll get discontinued).

Thinking ahead for the rest of the year, I think a no-buy is in order. I need to stop accumulating so much makeup. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello all,

I've been wondering how other library/computer aids handle it when a busy, frazzled mom and her fussy baby are in the adult computer area. When this happens I can tell that mom is doing her best to keep the little one from having a meltdown, but sometimes babies get loud, and you can't really reason with an infant.

Obviously if the baby is full-on screaming/sobbing mom takes them out. But I always feel awkward when the baby is sort of borderline loud/whiny and I can tell that other patrons are getting annoyed by it. The last thing I want to do is go up to a mom who's already at wit's end and tell her they need to be quieter. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My goal for this month was to cut out some of my unnecessary spending and shopping (namely, Starbucks/Ebay every day) to save up for a basic dental insurance plan. I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do it, since I've tried and failed in the past.

But I did it today! I purchased a dental plan! I'm really proud of myself. This is the first "mature, adult" self-care thing I've done in a long time.

Now my next tricks will be:

1) Actually going to the dentist (I don't wanna! I'm scared!)

2) Keeping up with the monthly payments (should be do-able as long as I stick to my budget).

I know this is a simple thing, but I'm excited! It's been so, so long since I made a goal like this and actually achieved it. Just wanted to share! Doing my happy dance right now! :) </TEXT>

<TITLE> Didn't use highlighter, turns out I look better without it </TITLE>

<TEXT> So, yesterday I was in a rush for work and tried to shorten my routine by not putting on highlighter (I usually use one of the e.l.f. ones).

Halfway through the day I was in the restroom and thought, "Hmm, my skin looks really good today" and then remembered I hadn't had time to put on highlighter.

To top it off, my mom said at dinner, "Your skin looks great! Like it's less oily or something."

SO, seems like I either wear too much highlighter (entirely possible, as I've been heavy-handed in an attempt to use up my extensive makeup stash) or I just plain look better without it.

I decided to skip it again today, and I'm liking the look.

Only thing is.....I have like, 15 highlighters (pans/palettes) that I haven't even opened yet. Looks like my hoarding tendencies got me again!

I have a few friends who love makeup, and I'm going to offer the unused highlighters to them.

Overall, this has been an expensive lesson. I let the "hype" get to me and I bought all kinds of stuff that it turns out I probably won't use. I went through this a few years ago with liquid lipsticks, too.

Just sharing this as an experience for my fellow makeup rehabbers out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As I prepare for another massive cleanup of my bedroom, I've been reflecting on the particulars of why it's so hard for me to let go of things.

I'm a hoarder, and my mom is, too. And whenever I finally get around to throwing some things away, my mom will go through the trash and take things out. She loves to do this with personal papers of mine- bills, journals, diaries, etc. Really private stuff that I don't want her to read. Last year after I cleaned up a little, I found notebooks that I'd thrown away next to her bed in the living room (she's always slept in the living room for various reasons.)

These notebooks were double bagged, and I'd made sure they were on the very bottom of the trash barrel, so she must have had to really dig to get to them (through food and cat litter and god knows what else). There was some super personal, very embarrassing content in those notebooks. I don't know if she'd actually gotten around to reading them yet.

I had originally planned on completely destroying the notebooks, but I was so tired from the cleanup that I just didn't have the energy.

I thought about confronting her, but ultimately decided not to, because I know from past experience that it won't go well.

This is partly why it's so hard for me to get rid of stuff....my mom is an obstacle. So when I throw things away or put them in the donate pile, I'm dealing with my own resistance, AND my mom's nosiness.

I'm guessing this is a pretty common thing in hoarder families. Have any of ya'll had to deal with something like this? </TEXT>

<TITLE> "Afraid" to Save Money/Earn More </TITLE>

<TEXT> Don't know if anyone can relate, but I am very resistant to saving money because, from past experience, I know I'll just end up blowing it all at a later date. I'm also resistant to earning more money (by going full time at my job, or picking up another job) because I know extra income will just cause me to dig myself into a deeper hole.

It depresses me that I'm like this, that my self-control and self-respect are so low that I'm "afraid of success" and that the thought of having long-term savings, a retirement account at some point, etc. seem like an impossible dream.

I plan on mentioning this to my therapist tomorrow. </TEXT>
