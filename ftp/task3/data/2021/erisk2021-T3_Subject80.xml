<TEXT> routine: wash with Loma moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. scrunch excess water out with big t-shirt. then apply Not Your Mother's detangling/leave-in conditioner spray (the stuff in the pink botttle). brush hair out with Wet Brush. apply Uncle Funky's Daughter: Curly Magic gel. plop for at least ten minutes (sometimes longer if i get busy). after plopping diffuse until 90% dry (i get tired of diffusing lol). then i get my bangs wet again (they look funky after diffusing) and apply Herbal Essence Curl mousse to them. then i scrunch out the crunch when it's 100% dry! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no idea. Neither of them got scholarships and my dad even ended up dropping out and going to a technical school. I think it's cause I'm a "former gifted child" which means they expect perfection from me when in reality I'm maybe slightly above average. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the reply. I kind of agree. I tried book club for a couple but didn't like the people. I'm also doing online school this year so clubs are kind of impossible. I might try some volunteer stuff but it might be hard with my work schedule. I'm not worried about my GPA because it's at least a 3.7 maybe a 3.8. </TEXT>

I have been arguing with my parents (mostly my mom) for a couple of years about this. My parents keep insisting that unless I get PERFECT A's in ALL my classes I won't get a scholarship. I haven't applied anywhere yet but I'm planning on applying to some state colleges. I am NOT going to an Ivy League school where they probably wouldn't give scholarships to anyone with less than a 4.0.

Everytime my mom brings it up I can't help but just internally groan and roll my eyes. How is getting a couple A minuses or B pluses going to dramatically affect my likely hood of getting a scholarship?? I don't expect to get a full ride or anything because I don't participate in clubs or sports and I don't really have anything else going for me, but I'm not not going to get a scholarship at ALL. I plan on applying for a bunch of small $500 scholarships too because apparently those add up fast and don't have much competition. Not to mention the fact that I am not going to college as soon as I turn 18, I'm going to work for at least a year to save up.

Are they spewing complete bullshit, partial bullshit, or do I really need perfect grades?? </TEXT>

<TEXT> i use BSL shaders! what world i use kind of depends. sometimes i like building on superflat if it's just a normal build. i use regular worlds if i want to try building on the side of a mountain or something else that might require terrain. using regular worlds can be good for inspiration! you might see a river and think "oh i want to try building a house that sticks out over the water." but in the end, it doesn't really matter what world you use :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> i used to struggle a lot with details too. tbh what helped me was looking at other peoples' builds for inspiration, watching youtube tutorials, and experimenting (mostly in creative mode). [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vbNeYh3C54) is a video by Grian that might help. i like to fill in empty space with fences, walls, and trapdoors. don't do overboard with details though, too much looks cluttered! using a variety of blocks helps too. another big thing is adding depth! in this particular build i used stripped warped logs as pillars and i made them stick out from the blackstone. i also used warped fungus to separate the first and second floor, it sticks out pretty far. another example of depth would be adding a layer of stone bricks (or cobblestone) on the bottom, in front of the blackstone (or whatever you are using as your main wall), to look like a foundation. it's kinda hard to explain. sort of like building in layers. it takes practice to learn how to add detail but it's not hard when you get the hang of it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> try different shapes! i like building in an L or T shape. sometimes stacking shapes can be cool too (like building the second floor larger than the first). using different roof styles as well can take your builds to a whole new level. sometimes i build something and it looks really boring until i add the roof! when i build something i experiment a lot and try different stuff to see what works. using a variety in blocks (like buttons, fences, walls, etc.) is good too. you can also use real life references if that helps. </TEXT>

<TITLE> DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam alternatives? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-07-09 21:28:11 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> hello! i would first like to mention that my hair is 3b and fine so i can't use any heavy products that contain ingredients like shea butter or coconut oil. i recently got my hair cut at a curly salon. the stylist recommended some styling products for me to use. i have been using Uncle Funky's Daughter: Curly Magic (a curl stimulating gel) and DevaCurl Frizz-Free Volumizing Foam. i was aware of the DevaCurl controversy but i figured i would try it out anyway. not the greatest idea. i've been losing almost twice as much hair than normal even though i got about half my hair chopped off :/

i also switched my shampoo and conditioner from Maui Moisture to Loma.

i like Curly Magic and i would like to continue using it (i have a huge 32 oz bottle). any good dupes for the foam? preferrably something cheaper. maybe something else to use instead of the foam that would mix well with Cury Magic? </TEXT>
