<TEXT> First I must provide that I am diagnosed with BPD and I find a lot of difficulty in making decisions for myself and therefore I just coast by most of the time.

Now onto the show haha,
I have thought a lot about myself and why it is so hard for me to connect with people or form basic friendships. I have come to the conclusion that this is because I have never done anything interesting, I have any hobbies or passions, I don‚Äôt go out of my way to try new things, I barely even do my school work, hell, I haven‚Äôt ever even asked a girl out.
Through these realizations I have decided that I need to find a hobby to hopefully discover myself again and hopefully discover other people as well.
Please help me think of hobbies or passions that I can look up and hopefully get into. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I‚Äôm really sorry you guys have to deal with this. A very important thing that I like to tell myself is that it is that life will continue moving, bad things unfortunately happen to the greatest of people, it‚Äôs our decision whether we get up and keep going or we let it continue to eat away at us. We make that decision, not the bad thing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I like to consider myself high functioning and I‚Äôm currently trying to make a decision to get on meds (with my psychiatrist of course) and I am mostly normal but I do have certain days where thoughts or ‚Äúfalse realities‚Äù become very strong and it is nearly impossible for me to get rid of them. A very common one is when I‚Äôm going to sleep by myself I feel a malicious presence of someone standing above me or just in the room with me. Despite many coping mechanisms such as deep breathing and counting, or trying to focus on music or watching a YouTube video to distract me. It doesn‚Äôt help until someone else (an actual physical real person) is also in the room.
To sum it up, I really don‚Äôt like medicine but I also really don‚Äôt like having these thoughts and feeling so I want to try medicine again but I‚Äôm terrible at making decisions :/. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had my first appt with a therapist through my school in about a year and she told me that my old psychiatrist had diagnosed me with ‚Äúdrug induced psychosis‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúBPD‚Äù. I knew about the BPD one but she never mentioned the other one. Which I felt kinda hurt by that she wouldn‚Äôt tell me about it. Like I know that they‚Äôre just professionals and it‚Äôs kinda reinforcing that they don‚Äôt actually care about me and they just write their little notes without a care in the world.
I also had my first meeting with a psychiatrist today (through my school and since the beginning of this year) and she kept comparing me to someone with Schizophrenia because I was talking about being confused about this reality (kinda complex). I just really can‚Äôt convince myself to trust the ‚Äúmental health professionals‚Äù. I feel like I need to talk to other people that have personal experience with this stuff instead of just learning about it in a book. (Another reason why I want to become a therapist) </TEXT>

<TEXT> CW: Suicidal thoughts and self harm
Anyone love going on late night walks? I am currently sitting outside my campus‚Äôs church so I don‚Äôt hurt myself and so I can focus on other things than suicide. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep the past few days and I‚Äôve just been hurting on the inside. I have my first therapy session (for about a year or so) in two days and I also have a chemistry test that I have no idea about, I also have a calculus test and I skipped my biology quiz last week. I‚Äôm literally falling apart, I have been trying to pull it together because my mom is getting married in less than a week and I want to be happy for her because she‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm still living today.
60% of my thoughts the past few days have been about dying or otherwise hurting myself because I need to release this pain that‚Äôs just been building inside me. This was supposed to be a nice post but at this point I just want to stop existing </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I personally haven‚Äôt been through this but in my head, (based on my emotions), I personally would never be able to justify something that is hurting someone else simply by saying I have BPD. In other words I don‚Äôt think it is an acceptable reason to act the way you have described without some sort of trying to better yourself.

And a romantic relationship between two people with BPD is always very very difficult. (Atleast from what I‚Äôve read about people and what I would assume from my life)

The only thing I can really advise is to follow your heart and you should always seek to increase your own happiness and allow yourself to blossom first </TEXT>

But I usually just don‚Äôt tell anyone that I have BPD, the only people that know are my parents and my sister. If I was going to tell someone I had BPD I would probably wait until you‚Äôve known them for a while because there is such a stigma attached to it. So that way the person won‚Äôt associate the stigmas with you because they already know how you are. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I absolutely do this as well, I don‚Äôt think of it as a bad thing because the things I don‚Äôt tel her are things that I don‚Äôt want to burden her with? Even though I should absolutely be telling her about everything that is causing me trouble. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a form of manipulation, I don‚Äôt like to consider myself manipulative but I do try to sway people‚Äôs opinions by acting certain ways and almost like telling them what they want to hear.

Something that I need to keep reminding myself of and I recommend you do the same is that your therapist is there to help you, they are in that profession to help you get through life, and they are unable to do this 100% if they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs really rough for me to come to terms with this but I‚Äôm working on it and I hope you can do the same :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have BPD and it certainly is annoying hearing it be used as a descriptor for people‚Äôs negative actions. But BPD is a highly stigmatized disorder and the majority of people who don‚Äôt associate or talk with someone who has BPD and only hears about it online are most likely going to assume BPD is terrible.

The only advice that I have that I use is to just try to not let it define your life, you are a human who happens to have BPD, not a Borderline human, if that makes sense </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I know this might not matter, but there is always a reason to continue on. I have been in the lowest of low points in my life, completely out of my mind on drugs screaming at myself in the mirror with a knife to my throat, but something inside me stopped me from putting in that final cut to take me out of this world. I still to this day do not know what that special thing was but I am so ever grateful for it. I‚Äôm still not 100% better but I am so much better off than that point, my point is that it takes extreme lows or dips in our lives for us to truly bounce back. It‚Äôs like landing on a trampoline, the deeper you bounce the higher you go.

<TEXT> It is certainly not an easy situation to be in. The only thing I can think of is to tell her that you want to help her and you only want the best for her and you will be there if she needs you but you cannot be in a romantic relationship with her if she continues to explode and then blame you for things she does.
It may not be good advice but It‚Äôs what I would want someone to do with me if I were doing that. (It might be really tough at first for her to accept and that‚Äôs the most crucial point to be supportive) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with other commenters. As someone with BPD it is very difficult to have a relationship with someone who has BPD, but that person should not use that as an excuse to treat the other person poorly. If the person with BPD is not able to have healthy mechanisms to deal with their own issues, they shouldn‚Äôt be in a relationship. (Side note: This is why I am not in a relationship haha) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey guys, I am a 19 y/o sophomore in college and I have BPD (borderline personality disorder). My school offers free counseling and I did attend therapy pretty much all of my first year and that‚Äôs how I got diagnosed and they put me on an antipsychotic and this mood stabilizer that‚Äôs normally used to treat seizures. I have yet to go back this year 1. Because they are doing just online video sessions 2. Because I‚Äôve had this switch within my thinking where I feel like they are trying to control my mind and they are just trying to hurt me or make me part of the system.

Explanation for #1, I have this irrational fear of phone calls and the video call seems like it is just a setup and isn‚Äôt real.

Explanation for #2, I‚Äôve always felt like they were against me but I kept going to talk about my feelings. But over the summer I stopped talking my meds cold turkey and I felt absolutely the same about a month later, this furthered my idea that they weren‚Äôt trying to help me, because the medicine did absolutely nothing yet my psychiatrist kept telling me that she saw improvements. </TEXT>

Although i have found that the diagnosis has 100% helped me in finding my identity (albeit quite a scattered one) it has still helped nonetheless.

A lot of the time i also feel horrible about my classes and I feel like i‚Äôm doing something wrong just by being in college and not doing something else.

A lot people use moderation as a mechanism for Alcohol or dieting but i have found that applying this ideology to normal life to be helpful. I tell myself that if i do 3/4 assignments then i am doing perfectly fine and it‚Äôs okay to miss some. same with classes, if I go to most of them then I am doing alright, thankfully my classes don‚Äôt count attendance.

<TEXT> I have only ever had one girlfriend and that was truly the happiest i have ever been in my entire life so far. Ever since then i have just been soul searching and avoiding forming relationships with anyone. I still feel like even though i was with my ex for a year, i never really became attached to her, because i knew she would eventually leave. I think i just enjoyed having someone to be intimate with and that was all it was for me. I basically just played her ‚Äúgame‚Äù of the little relationship things that you do like ask about how their day was or go on little dates, etc. This was before i was diagnosed with BPD and i knew something was different about me but it seemed like all the disorders that i read about on the internet all applied to me, anxiety, depression, bipolar, and i also had auditory and visual hallucinations but i tried to not tell anyone about that because they weren‚Äôt frequent and i didn‚Äôt want to be labeled a crazy. Back to having someone in my life, i feel like i‚Äôm missing a puzzle piece and that piece is on the shape of another human being. The only issue is that i‚Äôve developed a really unhealthy mechanism of not talking to anyone more that idle conversation and i‚Äôve just come to the conclusion that i am better off alone because i don‚Äôt get along with anyone and nobody would be able to understand my problems. Part of me also doesn‚Äôt want anyone to have to deal with me and to save everyone else i have built up 30 ft wide concrete walls 12 miles underground with laser turrets on the surface so nobody even comes close </TEXT>

<TEXT> *disclaimer: i‚Äôve been self harm free for nearly 2 years
Hey guys so i usually do not self harm or anything of that nature as when i think about it, the other side of my head reminds me that it only leads to regret and always makes me feel worse than the moment i was in that made me self harm in the first place. But recently i was gonna go to a party (in a college student) and then i told the person i didn‚Äôt want to go anymore like 10 minutes before because i just had a really bad feeling about the whole situation. Then that thought began to grab ahold of me and i just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to go at all, so i didn‚Äôt go. But then after that he went and i felt this overwhelming sensation of dread, despair and guilt like i just killed someone‚Äôs cat. Then then out of nowhere the thought of cutting crept into my head. I told myself i wasn‚Äôt gonna do it because it just makes me feel bad about myself and this one time my mom almost noticed my scars and i never regretted something so much in my life before. I went for a walk around my campus and just tried to listen to music but the more i walked, the more powerful the  thought of me hurting myself became. Then i started to think about the positives of it, (i know they‚Äôre are virtually no positives but I thought of stuff like it releases pain from my body). I then went back to my dorm and i tried to watch a movie and stop thinking about hurting myself, but then it was almost like i wasn‚Äôt in control of myself and i started cutting. that was three days ago and i still feel horrible about it and i don‚Äôt know why that thought decided to come into my head. I would love to know anyone‚Äôs coping strategies or how they prevent themselves from self harming so i can hopefully prevent it in the future.
side note: **maybe triggering** i was taking a shower and i was feeling the cuts and i began to visualize/see myself completely covered in scars and actually happy for once </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree, even though I had an ego death on Dec 15 last year I still look at it a learning experience, like not to take four white on white in a frat house with people I‚Äôve never met before </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don‚Äôt want to do it atleast 90% I would not recommend it but if you still want the experience I would keep a safety net like maybe your favorite music in a playlist and easily accessible headphones so you can come back to a happy place if you feel yourself slipping away, I wish you good luck and sending good vibes for your time <3 </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally have BPD and I used tripping to escape reality and enjoy other worldly feelings because I absolute dreaded being in this world. I tripped maybe 50 or so times, sometimes up to 6 hits and I would always have a good experience until I went to my friends frat house and tripped with him and two people I didn‚Äôt know and I took 4 white on white tabs and I ended up having an ego death and I still deal with flashbacks or waking up and having my soul sucked back into my body and my body feeling like glass shards and portions that don‚Äôt have feeling. The point is it only takes one trip when you have a mental disorder (like mine, idk about others) and always make sure you are with people you know and people you trust especially when you are suffering from a mental disorder </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it‚Äôs for other people to gauge how it‚Äôs going to feel and how they‚Äôre going to be throughout. But as someone who‚Äôs bought white on white from cartel (pretty close to the source if not the source) the guy still didn‚Äôt even know how strong it was, he just gave me a range of 200-300, of which I took 4 and had an ego death so I could reasonably assume I was on 800 and I will not be taking that amount again XD </TEXT>
