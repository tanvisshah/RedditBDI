<TEXT> Not to discourage you from talking about it with your mom or anything but I’ve been trying to look happy around people since I got out of the hospital because they’ve been so worried about me. It just hurts knowing that I’m not better and no one understands. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I feel you. I’ve been struggling with mental health since March just before covid became a big deal and honestly I thought it would get better but this semester is kicking my butt. There was a notoriously hard class and I passed the first exam by 4 percent and failed the final by 10 percent. I still have 2 more exams to make up because I had a mental breakdown due to this class and ended up in the hospital for suicidal ideation and missed 2 weeks of school. I was taking 18 credits and ended up dropping 2 electives and still barely keeping up with schoolwork. I’ve been really anxious since I got discharged a month ago and have been having flashbacks about being admitted daily and being on campus triggers it so much more. I’m not actively suicidal but I feel the thoughts coming back. I don’t care about grades like I did before, gave up on my dreams and just want to quit my job and school because I hate it. I honestly don’t know what I’ll do if I fail the 2 exams and fail the course and end up getting held back. I used to be an A student, top 15% of class and now I’m failing exams and getting bad grades. I don’t see a future for myself beyond this academic year and I’m just so miserable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m a third year pharmacy student and have had really tough time with mental health because of school and just childhood trauma since March just before covid became a big deal. My mom found out after she found a bill for my psychiatrist and I ended up telling the truth. It broke me to see her cry even though she was part of the reason for my trauma. I’ve tried so many meds and have been talking to the counselor since but school just got harder to the point I was really suicidal about a month ago. My counselor basically forced me to go to the hospital and I had to tell my mom about that. Since I’ve been out she’s been saying I sound and look happier and better but honestly I have more anxiety from being in the hospital than before. I might not be actively suicidal but I can feel the thoughts creeping back. I failed my last exam (which is the first time I’ve failed an exam in my life) and it probably was too soon for me to go back to school and I should have taken a leave. But I can’t disappoint my mom after skipping a year of college from AP credits in high school. Sometimes I hate pharmacy and wonder what’s the point but my parents invested so much money. I’m scared for APPEs next year and really don’t see a future for myself beyond this academic year. I want to do a residency but I don’t think I’m good enough. I once thought about going to med school after saving up money from working retail but I really don’t want anything in life anymore. My counselor often asks me what I would want if he had a magic wand and what I really want is to be not here and just be forgotten that I ever existed but I just say something vague. I’ve had good grades all throughout school but I feel like a failure to my mom and myself </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went into pharmacy school thinking that I would go into community. But in the middle of it, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and after having been in the psych ward for suicidal ideation, I realized that I had passion for psychiatry. You get exposed to so much new things in school, even areas you’ve never thought about. Community is not the only option and you might realize you have a passion for a certain area. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before I had anxiety it was mainly psychological, I had maybe 3-4 panic attacks that I can remember. I’ve tried 4-5 meds but none of them really gave me the physical feeling of anxiety. While I was at the hospital a month ago they put me on duloxetine and since then I’ve had really bad shaking, tremors and anxiety where I went to the pharmacy right after I got discharged and it was almost painful to stand there. The nurse at the hospital told me it was anxiety but honestly I thought it was from the med. My psychiatrist thinks that it’s from the bupropion so he’s been tapering me off of that. My shaking had gotten better but still there. Although my anxiety had gotten worse that being at school triggers my memory of when I went to the hospital (school counselor basically forced me to go) and I’ve had flashbacks every single day since I’ve been discharged. Now when I have flashbacks my body starts to shake and I have to take my clonazepam to make it go away. It was actually bad today at work that I felt nauseous when I had a random burst of flashback.

So in other words, yes my anxiety has gotten to be more physical symptoms after starting a new med. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They increased my dose while I was at the hospital. I only took it for a week before my psychiatrist decided to taper me off of it because I had really bad shaking and tremor in my hands and anxiety. They added duloxetine while I was in there so honestly that could have been the cause of the shaking. It’s been about a month and I’m now on 150 mg and my tremor is a little bit better so I don’t know. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’ve had a better experience than most horror stories I’ve heard. Most of the patients were normal (most were just dealing with withdrawals or depression like me), two people to a room, facility was decent and most of the nurses and techs were nice. The only thing was that it felt like you were in jail with the locked doors, everything being locked up and nurses checking on you every 15 min. Some places have decent therapy but the only group “therapy” I went to was playing games. You see the doctor once a day for about 5 min and pretty much have rest of the day to do....nothing. Most people watched tv all day, some colored or read books, at least they let us be in our rooms so I slept all day. When you’re in there, you really look forward to meal times just to break the monotony. The food wasn’t as good though. I got put on one med (duloxetine) but they only kept me for 2 days after starting it so I didn’t feel much effect except for terrible shaking that I still have which they told me was from anxiety. As far as medical records go, it probably stays on your record especially if it’s electronic medical record that’s commonly used by hospitals but you probably don’t have to worry about it affecting employment unless you disclose it. At least they aren’t supposed to have access to it...what actually happens? I don’t know </TEXT>

<TEXT> I told my therapist how I really wanted to die and wish I would never wake up and ended up in the hospital. It wasn’t a bad experience but I think it messed me up psychologically. I don’t know if I’ll be able to tell him if it happened again in the future though </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’ve been taking bupropion 3 months. When I first started taking it, it got me out of a slump, got me to actually do things instead of staying in bed all day and stop suicidal thoughts. And then school started and I can feel myself slipping again but it was manageable. About a month ago, I was really stressed out and had a mental breakdown. My counselor and my friend (along with many other people) basically forced me to go to the hospital. I stayed there for about a week but it got me a lot better. Psych wards aren’t exactly a therapeutic place but it can help you out of acute danger and adjust your meds so that you can feel better enough to seek therapy or more long term help. Depending on the hospital, it might be a good or bad experience. I’m still a mess and probably have been traumatized by my experience but I can’t deny that it helped me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m in my third year and did pretty well so far. This semester was just really horrible. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about 7 months ago and have been struggling with it since. About a month ago I was really stressed out and just had a mental breakdown and ended up in the psych ward. After a week being in there I dropped 2 courses, quit an on campus job and reduced my hours at the pharmacy. It’s a lot manageable now, but I had the same feelings, like everyone else can do it but I can’t. Just take it one step at a time. Focus on whatever is most urgent and don’t worry about all the the things you have to finish by the end of the week. Many people have gotten through it and you can too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have them right now, not sure if it’s because of bupropion though. They put me on duloxetine and increased my bupropion to 450 mg when I was in the hospital a month ago and that’s when it started. I had a practicum at school a week after where I had to transfer liquid from a vial to an IV bag using a syringe and my hand was trembling so much that I had to use all my concentration just to keep it steady. My psychiatrist’s been lowering my bupropion dose to stop it so we’ll see. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Having been in A’s shoes, here’s my thoughts. I was struggling with suicidal thoughts at the time and one day in class I broke down and texted my friend some stuff. She got other staff involved (the ones we know very well and trust). I needed to talk about it so I contacted my counselor on campus. He told me I could go to the hospital voluntarily or he would call the ambulance. After 3-4 hours I finally ended up agreeing because I had no way out of it. I don’t have a car so my friend volunteered to drive me. She had a doctor’s appt so we agreed to go after. I sneaked out but got caught by my counselor who happened to be outside at the time. Long story short I ended up in the psych ward for about a week. I was really angry at my friend and my counselor and just everyone. It seemed like they were all against me and didn’t care about what I wanted. A month later I still have some grudges and I feel like I just need to keep some stuff to myself from now on.

But I was able to forgive my friend because she was always there throughout the whole thing. I would get bored and call her 3 times a day and she would always answer my calls. After I got out I couldn’t stay by myself in the dorms so she let me stay with her and her boyfriend. She would make sure I take my meds and eat. But most of all she would remind me how much I meant to her and all the people who care about me. I deny that I needed to go to the hospital but I know that if I hadn’t, I would have tried something eventually.

Your friend might be too angry to be receptive, but show that you care. If they react negatively, you probably just need to give them space. I know that when I got out I was just so overwhelmed that I needed to be away from everyone in a quiet place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow that sounds a lot like me. I’m a third year pharmacy student, and got pushed into this field by my mom. I wanted to be a history teacher originally but she said I couldn’t get a job that way. I did pretty well in undergrad and up to this point actually. But I got burnt out by studying all the time, taking summer classes and trying to do well on rotations. There’s a class called infectious diseases that’s notoriously difficult. I barely passed the first exam. About a month ago, we had another exam that I was not prepared at all for. I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression and was struggling a lot with suicidal thoughts at that time. I had a mental breakdown in class right before the exam  and told my friend that I needed help. Long story short, my counselor coerced me to go to the hospital (it was either I go voluntarily or he would call the ambulance). I somehow mustered the courage to tell my mom and of course she was more concerned about me missing classes. I spent about a week at the psych ward and came out with more of an anxious mess (still am actually). I failed the final that we took couple days ago and I have to make up 2 exams during finals. If I don’t pass this course, I don’t know what I’m gonna do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tl;dr being involuntarily hospitalized traumatized me and I went from a smart student to a crazy person with serious problems and lost a part of myself.

I had to get this out there because I don't think anyone in my life understands.

About a month ago I had a mental breakdown at school. During the week prior, I was struggling with suicidal thoughts. Every single night I contemplated overdosing on my meds. I talked to anyone and everyone I confided in because I knew that it was getting bad. There was an exam that Friday that I was not prepared for. I barely passed the last exam so I knew I would fail this one. Right before the exam, I had a class. During class, I was thinking about how I would fail the exam and how I had to go to work for a 7 hour shift after even though all I wanted to do was sleep my troubles away. That morning when I really wished I wouldn't wake up and was angry that I did. My brain told me that I could still OD so that I wouldn't have to go to work. It was that point when I realized that I was having a mental breakdown and I didn't have the mental capacity to take the exam. I texted my friend because she understood what I was going through, having mental illnesses herself and I emailed my counselor for some resources or people I could talk to so that I can figure out how to manage my course load. My friend told some library staff about my message (we have a really close relationship with them) and they called the security to check in on me. The problem was that I was in class so they stopped the class to talk to my professor. He forgot to turn the mic off and unintentionally revealed that I had depression. After that I just had a panic attack for the rest of class. I ended up getting an excused absence for the exam and went to go talk to my counselor. I spent about 3-4 hours in his office with him trying to get me to go to the hospital and me refusing to go. He got my friend involved because I didn't have a car and after all that, I finally agreed to go because it was either I go voluntarily or he was going to call the ambulance so I really had no way out of it. My friend had a telehealth appt with her doctor so we were going to go after. I decided to take a nap but I had so much anxiety that I just needed to talk to someone. So I sneaked out of my room to go talk to one of the library staff. I was actually prepared to hide from my friend to avoid going to the hospital. Somehow my counselor saw me and thought that I was running away. He found me talking to the library staff and we had another chat. In the end, we compromised on me going to a behavioral health urgent care that recently opened up. He actually walked me to my room to get my insurance card because he thought I would run away again. After about an hour or 2 at the urgent care, they told me I couldn't leave and they had to admit me. So I went through all this trouble just to end up with the obvious outcome.

I spent 5 days in the psych ward. I hated the first 3 days because I didn't want to be there but slowly accepted it. I slept pretty much all day because there was nothing to do and I didn't want to watch TV. Their group therapy was just playing games with a group and there really was no therapy at all. The doctor spent at most 5 minutes just asking questions and seeing how you were doing and I saw the social worker once. The food was really bad and it was annoying having the nurse check in on you every 15 minutes and waking you up at 6 am to take vitals. But overall compared to other stories, I had a better experience. Everyone was "normal," just struggling with their mental illnesses like I was. There was no isolation or restraints (or rather it wasn't needed) but it was just so boring. Every morning I would wake up and just think another day of doing nothing. There was no doctor on the weekend so when I arrived there I didn't see anyone and I thought I would never get out of there.  But I have to admit it was nice just being away from social media and rest of the world and not having to worry about school. I was put on another medication which made me really shaky and had really bad tremor in my hands. On the last day I was there I had HR of 122 even though I wasn't doing anything. It was so bad that on the first day I went back to work I was shaking so much that I couldn't type, write or do anything.

So one month out from the psych ward, my mood's been better and I haven't had any suicidal thoughts. When I first got out I had so much anxiety that I couldn't be around people and couldn't stay in the dorms by myself so I've been staying with my friends. I dropped 2 electives (I was taking 18 credit hours before), quit an on campus job and got my hours reduced at work. I'll be making up my exams during finals week, so everything's all better right?

I feel like I lost a part of myself at the hospital. Every single day and night my brain replays that week over and over again. What if I had run away? What if I didn't tell anyone and OD'ed? Everywhere I go on campus it reminds me of what happened. When I walk to my room, it feels like my counselor is next to me, making sure I don't run away. I remember most of the conversation, word for word. And it just causes so much anxiety and sadness. When I'm with my friends, it just stops at the memory. But when I'm by myself in my room, it spirals down to more complex thoughts that I know will eventually lead to suicidal thoughts.

I'm happy to be with my friends. They've been really supportive and taking care of me. So why do I feel so empty inside? I would often stare into space and feel sad. I study and try to do well in my classes just like before but I don't care about my grades anymore. I go through the actions of my normal self but it means nothing to me. The future still seems bleak and I'm not good enough to achieve my goals. I laugh and truly feel happy around my friends but I feel like I've crossed a line where they don't understand me anymore. No one knows what it's like being in a psych ward. The moment they took me in a wheelchair from the urgent care with the security next to me, I felt defeated, powerless and helpless. I felt humiliated when they strip searched me and took everything, even my hairband away. My friend actually held my arm yesterday and I couldn't handle it because I felt so restrained. I hated myself for getting in this mess and felt like everyone was against me, banded together to put me in a psych ward. I truly felt like I'm crazy enough to be put in a psych ward. I went from being a smart student in the top 15% of the class to a crazy person with serious problems. I look at everyone and think 'you will never understand me.'  I don't know if I can truly open up to anyone again. If I can look for help when I'm suicidal and tell someone I'm close to losing it. If I can be honest and true to my feelings. When the people who know about the psych ward ask me how I'm doing, I say I'm better. But I'm not. Even at the lowest of my lows it was better than this because I was myself.

&#x200B;

Every day I wish I could just be locked away forever. Being a socially awkward introvert among strangers with similar problems and  not deal with the world anymore. I may not be suicidal but it doesn't mean I want to live.

If you've made it this far, thank you for reading. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took it about 4 times while I was in the psych ward. I was pretty anxious because I didn’t want to be there (kind of involuntarily voluntarily went). It took me hours to actually fall asleep because of all the thoughts in my head, the nurses checking on you every 15 minutes and my roommate was snoring all night. Taking it made me relax and made it so much easier to go to sleep. It’s not as strong as clonazepam which is what I usually take  but I thought it helped given the situation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started cymbalta at the psych ward about 2 weeks ago. The day after I took it I was just really shaky and felt like my heart was pounding. The last day I was there I actually had HR of 122 just after lunch. The nurse told me it’s just anxiety. After I got discharged I went to the pharmacy to get my meds filled and standing there, waiting for the prescription with all those people (even though I work there so I know all the staff) I was just so anxious that I felt like I couldn’t remain standing. The next day I went to school to see couple of people and my friend talking to someone was so overwhelming and anxiety inducing. I went back to work couple of days later and was just shaking so much. It’s gotten much better after 2 weeks but my body is still shaky. I haven’t had to take my klonopin in a while so I can see that my anxiety has subsided a lot compared to when I went to the hospital. I still get flashbacks of being at the psych ward and that sometimes get anxiety and feel really empty sometimes but it got better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m so used to saying good that I just automatically say it when someone asks me. My psychiatrist asked me “how are you good if you’re so anxious from your medication?” Worse is when I say good to my counselor as a formality he actually believes it and I can’t really bring up all the problems I have after that.

This happened a couple of days ago at work. My boss has been on a business trip for about 2 months so we haven’t seen him. He stopped by when I was working and asked me how school was going. Automatically I say it’s good and he said you sound so sad. The truth is that I was. 3 weeks ago I had a mental breakdown in class and ended up in a psych ward for about a week. Since then being on campus triggered flashbacks from the hospital and just thoughts that’s not necessarily suicidal but can spiral into bad thoughts. On one hand I wanted to tell him but I didn’t want him to think that I was crazy. It makes me die inside when I have to lie about how I am.

I learned that I could say the truth but also kind of cover it up with cheerfulness like “oh it’s been rough but hanging in there.” If they want to know , they’ll ask more about it or if not, just let it go. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m in grad school and thought it would be a great idea to take 18 credit hours (which is the max we can take without paying extra). 3 weeks ago I had a mental breakdown in the middle of class before an exam for another class. It wasn’t even about not wanting to take the exam, I mentally didn’t have the capacity to take it. I was dreading work that afternoon and all I could think about was taking all the meds I have. Thinking back on it I probably wouldn’t have died with the meds I had but nevertheless that’s how I felt. I texted my friend that I needed help, emailed my counselor and just talked to anyone I felt like I could talk to. I spent about 3 hours with my counselor with him trying to convince me to go to the ER and me refusing to. I ended up agreeing because he threatened to call the ambulance and I stayed about 5 days there.  I hated it at first because I didn’t want to be there but eventually got used to it. It was just nice sleeping all day, not worrying about anything and being away from social media and the world. I got discharged and applied for excused absences for about a week because I had exams that I simply could not take. Because I was asking for so much time off, the dean wanted to meet with me. I ended up dropping 2 classes and working less hours. I’ll be making up the exams during finals which gave me time to catch up on homework. I’m still an anxious mess and a lot of things still overwhelm me. Going to the hospital was like a defining moment in my life both good and bad where I realized I need to take care of myself instead of studying all day to get good grades but also just not knowing what to do with my life.

Sorry about the long story but I felt that it was very similar to your situation. Maybe you don’t have to go as far as actually attempting suicide. If you’re willing to, staying in a psych ward isn’t as bad as it sounds. It got my mind off of school and as much as I hated my counselor for forcing me to go, I really needed that break and I probably would have tried to overdose eventually from added stress. I’ll admit that while I’m not suicidal anymore being at school triggers certain thoughts that can spiral down and I often feel empty, but school doesn’t have to be everything. I was one of those people who would freak out about missing one class. I don’t regret one bit about missing 2 weeks of school from my hospitalization. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I felt that way when I got out about 2 weeks ago. I couldn’t stay in the dorms by myself so I ended up staying with my friends for a while. I had pretty bad anxiety around people for a while but I’m doing better now. I still constantly think about the day I got involuntarily admitted (my counselor threatened to call the ambulance if I didn’t go voluntarily) wondering what would have happened if I didn’t tell my friend that I was really suicidal or if I ran away when I had the chance. Well I’m still alive and not suicidal (maybe I’m scared that it would happen again so my mind is blocking those thoughts) but being on campus triggers these thoughts and feelings of emptiness. I go through the motions of being a student but it doesn’t give me any feelings of fulfillment. I feel lonely and like no one, not even my best friend who has been suffering with mental illness longer than I have or my counselor who also has depression, understands what my mind is going through. And a lot of times I wish I was back in there, where I could sleep all day and forget about everything that’s going on in life, away from social media and politics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’ve been on 6 different meds in the past 5 months since I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. There were periods when it made me feel better and less depressed and times when they stopped working. Just 2 weeks ago I was admitted (unwillingly) at the hospital for really bad depression and suicidal ideation. I’ve been better now but realized that there’s a void that depression used to fill. I’m not as depressed now or feel suicidal but I feel empty. I go through the motions of life like before but at times I stare into space like nothing matters. Depression made me feel like a human. And now I feel so distant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’ve been struggling in class because of my work schedule and couldn’t focus because of my depression. Today I had an exam that I was not prepared for and had been having really bad suicidal thoughts, although the amount of pills I had probably wouldn’t have been nearly enough to kill me. I had a class at 8 and the exam at 10. I was having a panic attack in class at 8 because of the exam coming up. I told my friend, who told couple of trusted adults at school and they called the public safety to check on me. Kind of awkward because it was an in person/online class where some people were in class and some people online and the professor had his mic on so people heard some things about me. I really felt like I couldn’t take the exam because I wasn’t in the right mind with suicidal thoughts so I emailed my counselor if there was anyone on campus I could talk to. Turns out he was on campus (he had been working from home for couple of days before), so I went to talk to him. That was a huge mistake. I spent 3 hours in his office while he was trying to get me to go to the hospital and I didn’t want to because of the cost, my work, not wanting to tell my mom all that. He dragged my friend into it and it was either I go to the hospital or stay in his office for god knows how long until he called the ambulance. So now here I am in my room, can’t even take a nap while my friend has her doctors appt (she was going to take me to the hospital after) because I have so much anxiety right now. I might sneak out and hide for a bit. I wasn’t going to kill myself tonight or actually do it but my counselor didn’t believe me. I’ll just see how t he rest of this day goes </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’ve been on bupropion for over a month now, it worked great until school started. I’m taking this 5 hr credit class crammed into one month so we have quizzes/exams every week, currently taking 18 credits (I was dumb for thinking I could do this) as well as tutoring people and working in retail pharmacy. Well I barely passed my first exam and don’t have the mental capacity to study for the upcoming one on Friday and just keep on doing horribly on quizzes. I work majority of my weekend so I don’t have the time to catch up or study. The bupropion was helping with depression and suicidal thoughts and it’s come back so much worse.

And then today my school announces that they are changing its name without asking for our opinions. My school had a good reputation and now no one is going to know who we are. It’s just a generic name like university of health sciences (I won’t indulge the full name here) with a crappy logo and at least 90% of the people I’ve talked to and seen on facebook hate this. There were some issues before but I didn’t regret coming here....until now. I don’t know why I’m at this shitshow of a school to go into a profession that’s hopeless (berated by patients, controlled by insurance companies and belittled by corporate) to help shitty people who feel they are entitled to everything.

I don’t know why I’m still alive. I hate myself, I hate the world and I don’t want to know what the future brings. I think 20+ years is good enough. I don’t want to hurt all the people who love and care about me but I just don’t want to fight life anymore. My counselor tells me that he’s happy that I’m in his life but I’m not. He tells me I’m strong for making it this far, but I just can’t go further. Recently being diagnosed with anxiety and depression changed me that I want to give up and stop the suffering. My mom fought with my dad to have a second child. I wish she hadn’t.

I sat for 30 minutes staring at my medicine bottles. I’ve got everything I need, I still don’t think it’s enough to OD and I keep thinking I should get a refill so that I have more on hand. It’s just funny that today was probably the closest I came to doing it. I have the means to do it, more than ever before. Then my mom called me and said I was in her dreams and was just checking on me. I don’t know if you believe in these things but her dreams give freakishly accurate warnings when bad things happen. Is this fate’s way of keeping me alive? Well I’m still alive I guess. I don’t know for how long but the way 2020 is going, who’s knows?

Sorry it’s a messy rant and just want to tell someone because how do you tell someone you want to kill yourself constantly when you don’t want to hurt them, even if they are a counselor?

Tl;dr thought things would get better with school opening up again but struggling with classes and school deciding to change its name out of nowhere. 2020 is just full of surprises. </TEXT>

<TEXT> you might see some decrease in blood pressure while taking it due to lower heart rate and maybe some increase in blood pressure when you go off on it. If you have a normal baseline blood pressure the fluctuation shouldn't cause you to have problems with your blood pressure. I would say 12.5-25 mg is a low dose compared to dose for hypertension (around 25-200 mg) so it shouldn't cause any problems. But each person reacts differently so you can definitely monitor blood pressure for a while when you start it, but I think a lot of doctors wouldn't consider it significant enough to monitor at every office visit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Normal therapeutic dose of atenolol can go up to 200 mg (not anxiety specifically but in general including other indications) so I would say you should be safe at lower dose of 12.5-25 mg. There is a warning that it can worsen asthma in patients if you already have it but the chances of that are unlikely given that atenolol has 20 times more affinity towards beta 1 over beta 2. Atenolol is also used for high blood pressure and chest pain and it does that by lowering your heart rate. If you have really low heart rate, it’s probably not the best choice for you (my friend can’t take propranolol for that reason) but it won’t have any lasting damage to the heart or anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have experience with it but yes, atenolol has a lower risk of causing asthma. Atenolol is a beta blocker and there are two types of beta receptors, beta 1 and beta 2. Stimulation of beta 2 induces bronchodilation, and that's why a lot of asthma inhalers target beta 2 receptors. Atenolol is a beta 1 blocker, which has no effect on the airways at therapeutic doses. At really high doses it can induce asthma, but it has lower risk than other nonspecific beta blockers that target both beta 1 and beta 2. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see medication as an adjunctive to therapy. You can fix your brain chemicals but if your mental health is negatively impacted by past trauma, it’ll come back. Taking medication and feeling better helps with therapy a lot because your brain can process things more easily when you’re not constantly depressed, anxious or suicidal. Therapy and especially cognitive behavioral therapy can help in learning to deal with things like anxiety attacks or negative thoughts. </TEXT>

It felt weird at first to tell someone I just met all these things about my life but he was very understanding despite cultural differences. I think that that’s what made me trust him and the fact that he was trying to understand my culture.  I’ve been through some rough times since then with suicidal thoughts and he’s always tried to be there for me although not always accessible. Given the circumstances, telehealth is better than nothing and it did help a lot. The only thing is that I didn’t have much privacy at my home and internet connection issues.

<TEXT> I've taken wellbutrin less than 3 months, actually less than a month, but it's the best one among all the other ones I've tried. It gave me energy and motivation and the biggest thing is that it reduced a lot of suicidal thoughts. The side effects are manageable and the benefits outweigh them. I'm hoping that it stays that way because I would hate to switch to a different med. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depression and anxiety have a weird relationship. When I had really bad depression on Zoloft, I was sleeping all day and couldn’t think which decreased my anxiety. On the other hand, when my antidepressant worked and I could think clearly, I had a lot of anxiety. But sometimes my anxiety leads to depression and vice versa </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’ve stayed up till 4 once because my anxiety was really bad from Wellbutrin. It’s like my body is tired but my brain is too active for me to fall asleep. I’ve tried melatonin which sort of worked and then stopped working and my psychiatrist prescribed Ambien but I’m trying to not take it everyday. It’s just annoying when I keep waking up hours before I have to actually get up. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m on Wellbutrin right now but tried abilify for a month before switching. I was on 2 mg for 2 weeks, 5 mg for 2 weeks and 10 mg for 1 week. It worked for the first week of 2 mg and 5 mg and then stop working. Then I stopped with 10 mg because it had no effect (heard it’s not a usual dosage for depression). The only side effect I had was weight gain, I think I gained about 20 lb in the month without much changes in my diet. But Wellbutrin helped lose some of that weight.

<TEXT> Being an Asian myself, I have some theories. The first is that mental health isn’t considered like physical illnesses. There’s a lot of stigma and less help available for mental illnesses in the Asian culture.

The second is the amount of stress. Korea has one of the highest teenage suicide rates because of a huge focus on academics and pretty much everything depending on grades, even starting in elementary schools. Not to mention bullying in schools is rampant. </TEXT>

I had to increase the dose every 2 weeks because I would feel better for the first week at each dose but I would be depressed again. My pharmacist and psychiatrist thought it was odd that I had some sleep issues (waking up several times a night) since it’s not much of a stimulant but other than that the only other issue was gaining weight and not having much effectiveness.

So for example one of the anxiety I have is not studying enough and not doing well on my exam because I had to work the day before or I’ve got other classes to worry about too. He told me to think of a time when I actually failed my exam and I couldn’t come up with anything. There are times I didn’t do as well but even then I couldn’t think of any times when that exam ruined my college career or something like that. It helped me with spiralling thoughts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m currently taking Wellbutrin, which is the 4th one I’m trying after all the ones had bad side effects or stopped working. It’s helped a lot with my depression but not so much for my anxiety. But one of the biggest problem I have is insomnia. I have so much anxiety that I don’t fall asleep until 3 or 4 and usually get like 4-5 hours of sleep.

My psychiatrist prescribed Ambien to help me sleep even though clonazepam helped me sleep sometimes (I just don’t take it daily). He told me that it can lead to sleepwalking or sleep eating and now I’m scared to take it. Supposedly it’s a rare side effect but the fact that I could do crazy and dangerous things and not remember in my sleep is making me anxious. I could just not take it but I know my psychiatrist is going to ask me about it. When I was prescribed clonazepam I was scared about addiction so I didn’t take it and he seemed kind of pissed because he wanted to see if it helped me or not. I keep thinking about it and changing my mind on if I should take it or not and it’s triggering my anxiety. </TEXT>

Sometimes I use it when I have a lot of anxiety at night and can’t sleep, just feeling really emotional from anxiety, or have an anxiety attack at work. It’s nice to be able to clear my mind when it’s loud with all these thoughts and just generally helps me calm down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They say that antidepressants can increase the risk of suicide in younger people. Often times this is because it takes a while for the medicine to build up and have a full effect. In the meantime you have more energy and mental capacity to do things, yet still depressed which can unfortunately enable people to commit suicide. But it depends on people and as long as you’re aware of it, you can talk to your doctor as soon as you feel that something is off and discontinue the med.

In regards to addiction, antidepressants aren’t really addictive. You do need to wean off and if you’re going to discontinue after a long time because your brain is used to having that much serotonin and need time to adjust. But it doesn’t have any addictive properties as some meds like Xanax which is commonly used for panic attacks do. Some people take them for years, I haven’t seen anything that says they’re harmful over a long period of time.

If you struggle with your panic attacks and if it impacts your school work, it’s worth trying. Having relief from panic/anxiety attacks can help improve your grade.

Just keep in mind that antidepressants work differently for people and just because it doesn’t work the first time doesn’t mean it’s bad or you shouldn’t take anything at all. I have depression and anxiety and it’s made such a difference in helping me focus and be motivated as well as have less suicidal thoughts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Usually I post with my throwaway account but whatever.

I had an argument (not really an argument since it was a one sided argument because I refused to talk to my mom) about going back to school in a week.

Basically it triggered memories of childhood abuse and sexual assault from my brother. It took me months of talking with my therapist to get over this and it comes back again to haunt me. I thought I was finally at peace with my past but I guess not.

On the other hand I’ve got to do a whole bunch of COVID testing as part of my job by myself and I hate it. I’m dreading work tomorrow.

I’ve been thinking about overdosing on my med even if I fail. I started on a new med that made me feel so much better and got rid of a lot of my suicidal thoughts. But they’re back again. All mg memories and suicidal thought just haunt me and how much I don’t want to be here </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’d definitely ask to switch, it usually takes a while to find the right combination of medications and there are just so many out there. I’m currently trying my fourth medication which got my depression under control but anxiety not so much. You can feel a lot better and don’t have to feel this way, it’s perfectly fine to say this doesn’t work, let’s try something else </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was on abilify for about a month, 2 weeks of 2 mg, 2 weeks on 5 and 1 week on 10 mg. It helped me a lot in terms of my depression and anxiety. It gave me energy and motivation. The only problem was it only worked for 1 week at each dose and at 10 mg it stopped working. I gained about 10-20 lb and that’s the only side effect I had but after being off it and taking Wellbutrin I’m starting to lose some of that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had this feeling when I started my job as an intern in a retail pharmacy because I felt useless and so slow. He told me I was doing great and that I'm a hard worker and that made the feeling go away. And 2 years later, we've hired 2 more interns. I feel like I'm being compared to them and that I need to be better because I've been there longer and a year ahead in pharmacy school.

There's a website that the company uses to recognize people in the workplace. Just anything that helped the team or whatever. I logged on out of curiousity and saw that he recognized everyone except me. I work hard, and I cover shifts whenever I can. I do everything to help out because it feels like a family. I don't know if it's because he recently found out I had anxiety and depression because I fill my prescriptions there out of convenience or if I'm doing something wrong. My anxiety makes me keep thinking about it and makes me think that he doesn't like me and then I try to analyze every single thing. I don't know if I have a future with this company when I graduate or if it's even worth staying. It was like my backup job but I don't know anymore </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm 22 and I feel that way. I'm coming close to graduating with a pharmacy degree in 2 years, this year will be my last year in classroom and then I have to go out there and work in various pharmacies for a whole year. My identity was being a student and my goal was getting good grades and now that I'm nearing the end of it, what happens next? I know what it's like to work in retail pharmacy and experienced all kinds of crazy people from the public and probably will spend rest of my life doing the same thing over and over again. There's nothing that I do that keeps my attention for more than 15 minutes that I'm just sleeping or on social media all day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’ve tried sertraline, trazodone and abilify and now currently on Wellbutrin. Sertraline helped, maybe because it gave me such a bad depression that I was sleeping all day and not want to do anything, even pulling. I started doing it again on abilify but switching to Wellbutrin has helped so far (but I’m only 4 days into it).

It’s hard to mention it to anyone and it was really cringey saying it. But I think I got the courage to because I stopped at the time and wasn’t as ashamed of myself so I know how hard it is to get help for it. My psychiatrist said that it’s linked to anxiety and controlling anxiety could help. I’ve tried to quit for years by myself and never got past one or two days before starting medications. I’ve seen a lot of people use an app to keep track of how many days you’ve been pull free if that might help motivate you </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mine was mostly on my scalp but I've pulled for about similar amount of time as you (started around 9/10, currently 22) and it was just something I hated about myself. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about 4 months ago and started taking medicine for it and it actually helped me stop. It's also something I haven't talked too much about with my therapist, I just mentioned it once, but if you're not open to taking medication, behavioral therapy is an option to help stop. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry I haven't taken Abilify as a combo, just as monotherapy but it was very odd for me. It would work for the first week I took it at 2 mg and then would stop and then work for the first week of 5 mg and then completely stopped working altogether after increasing to 10 mg. It was great when it worked, and maybe it would have worked if I took it as a combination with something else but I honestly didn't really like the weight gain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know I haven't taken it long enough to say it works but I hope it eases your mind about side effects at least. I've taken it for 4 days and I would have to say it's the best one so far (I've tried Zoloft, trazodone and Abilify) and currently on clonzepam for anxiety as needed. I have depression and anxiety and when my depression was bad I would have no motivation to do anything and just sleep all day. Wellbutrin gives me enough energy and motivation to get through my shift at work (I work in retail pharmacy which can be mentally and physically draining) and at least not stay in bed and sleep all day. Sometimes it gives me too much energy that I can't get to sleep but I take melatonin and it helps, and also the formulation (SR vs. XL) can make a difference if it bothers you. It's been working well so far for my depression, I wish it helped with my anxiety more too but at least I don't think it's worsened my anxiety because I haven't had to take my clonazepam much since taking wellbutrin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don’t have any experience with them but being irreversible refers to how they work. Basically enzymes called MAO bind to neurotransmitters important for mood such as serotonin and dopamine and degrade them. MAOIs are inhibitors of MAO so that the neurotransmitters aren’t degraded. The irreversible part refers to how the MAOs are inhibited. With irreversible binding, the MAO enzymes can no longer be used whereas with reversible binding, the enzyme will come off sometime later and can be used again </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a similar situation once, I was in a very bad place and my counselor was concerned about me. He told me to voluntarily go to an ER or he would call an ambulance and have me admitted. He told me that he didn't want to do anything that I didn't want to do (go to hospital and be admitted in this case) but it was his duty and job to make sure I didn't hurt myself and if he had to he would get me admitted.

So that could be one thing. Another thing is that when you're voluntary, you can choose to leave earlier if they believe that you're not a threat to yourself. But when it's forced you do have to stay there for 72 hours. So it could be that they wanted to give you a choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We've been doing COVID testing for 4 months and this is the first time I've seen anyone like this. It wasn't me doing the test but we talked about this for a long time after it happened.

There was a patient who started off well until the point where she opened up the swab. I guess she must have seen something on the tip of the swab, dust maybe? But these are sealed so I highly doubt there was anything really on there but who knows. My coworker gave her another one but then she refused to do the test with the swab that we gave her. If she refused to do the test then, it wouldn't have been a big deal. She then came into the store to buy a Q-tip because she believed that the government was spreading COVID through the tests. Another one of my coworkers went up to her and told her a Q-tip wouldn't work and so she left the store. She came back through the drive thru claiming that she used the swab. I was helping her at this point and we were lost on what to do but she ended up just ignoring us and dropping her kit in the box. I honestly don't care what she used and if she did use anything other than the swabs, the lab people probably wouldn't run her sample but that was just the craziest thing I've heard all day. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If your depression and anxiety are preventing you to be a student, and especially with suicidal thoughts, you should try them. That being said, at the end of the day, no one can force you to take them so you'll have to accept it rather than anyone telling you to.

Here's my experience with it. I was diagnosed with anxiety by my therapist before the quarantine hit and depression much later. With the COVID it got really bad that I had panic/anxiety attacks everyday and I couldn't focus on studying. I almost had a panic attack in the middle of an exam and at work and I had no motivation to do anything. That's when I decided to try medications because it was something I'd never experienced before and I was scared. I tried sertraline first, which is SSRI and it gave me really bad depression that I was sleeping all day and not doing anything else. 2 weeks after I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed trazodone. It worked great, it made me feel normal again but it gave me diarrhea every morning and stomachache that I couldn't handle. I'm currently on Abilify and clonazepam. I will say that I was scared to take clonazepam at first because of its habit forming abilities but it's helped me out a lot. Abilify worked great with mood, motivation and pretty much everything I was struggling with but it only worked for one week at 2 mg, 5 mg and now I just increased to 10 mg. So clonazepam helped with suicidal thoughts and anxiety when abilify didn't work.

Bottom line is, it takes a while to find something that works. Even when you do, there may be some side effects that you don't like. I gained about 30 lb I think due to abilify and I'm still trying to decide if that's worth it. But I love this feeling of not crying every day and wanting to kill myself and feeling like needing help all the time. If I gain any more weight, I'll probably ask to go off on it but I'm planning on start working out again as soon as my school opens. It's all about balances and how much you are willing to handle/tolerate the side effects because when the medication works, it makes things so much better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've had some that work and some that don't, and some with side effects which wasn't bad but I couldn't handle like diarrhea and stomach pain. Trying all these medications made me realize how much difference they make when they work. I have motivation to do daily tasks, much less anxiety and suicidal thoughts. It helps me control my thoughts and feelings without them getting too carried away with anxiety. In other words, it makes me feel normal and functional without feeling the need to cry and lie in bed all day. </TEXT>

We just got notice that they won't be accepting us anymore because of COVID so now I have to find a new psychiatirst. I've seen him for about 2 months and he's been really thorough and understanding. It's either find a new one or go to his other clinic about an hour away, which won't be possible because I don't have a car.

<TEXT> Some of my favorite things were flu shot clinics at a living facilities and taking blood pressures for them. There was a mts clinic right next to the pharmacy so I got to sit in on that too which was fascinating because I didn’t know anything about it. I actually didn’t see my preceptor for the first 2 weeks which I wished he could have been there more but he taught me about control inventory and I helped out with it which was fine. The things I didn’t like was them pretty much handing things off that they didn’t want to do like adherence phone calls (I do enough of those at work) without any learning point behind it and just filling. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been wanting to just overdose on my medication and just go into a deep sleep. If I had alcohol maybe I would have come close to it. If I didn't have any obligations for school I would have checked into a hospital because my thoughts have been uncontrollable for the past few days. Every time I pass a bridge I think about jumping and usually thinking of my friend and therapist stops a lot of these thoughts. But now I don't care. If I hadn't called the behavioral health line 2 days ago, I might have actually attempted it. It's just been so much struggle trying to get past every day. Maybe one day it'll be 2 tablets and then 5. I don't know how long I can deal with these emotions. It's not even feeling hopeless, it's just really raw emotions that hit me no matter what the situation is. </TEXT>

I’ve been taking abilify for depression and anxiety and klonopin for anxiety attacks. I’ve been taking abilify for about a month and the first week it worked great. Then it stopped so the psychiatrist increased the dose. It worked well for another week and not so much anymore. I don’t like taking klonopin because I don’t want to depend on it but I’ve been taking it everyday to get through my anxiety. Now I took it about 3 hours ago and it’s doing nothing. I just want to take all I have and take a nice sleep or something because I know I don’t have nearly enough to actually die. I hate feeling like this. I don’t know what to do anymore. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Currently on mine right now. First week we did a lot of tech stuff within the inpatient pharmacy, so filling orders, delivery, pulling from the carousel, compounding, stuff like that. A lot of our time was spent filling. Second week we got to shadow pharmacists verifying orders and product. Our preceptor is a med reconciliation pharmacist so we did a lot of med rec. Next week we’ll look at IV/TPNs. We have a writing assignment from school but our preceptor also gave us a packet of questions to answer using databases. We were planning on shadowing rounding too but with covid a lot of it is telehealth so probably won’t be able to do that. Depending on your preceptor and site you might have projects like journal club but we don’t have any major assignments like that. I was worried about clinical knowledge but all they asked us so far is what each drug does, and just look up new drugs to share each day and random questions as homework. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used to be really outgoing as a child, and then we moved to 2 different countries and new schools and that just made me really introverted and having anxiety doesn't help. One of my biggest fears going into college was making friends. I couldn't make friends even with my roommate and really couldn't make friends with anyone because half of my classes were freshman and half were sophomore classes so I didn't really fit in. There was one girl that I did project together once, I didn't know her that well but I saw her studying at the library all the time and something just clicked in my head. After weeks of debating whether I should go up to talk to her, I finally got the courage to and she's my best friend now. I had all the fears that you had and of course having no friends worsens your depression. My advice for you and one I glad I did is muster up the courage to talk to them and if it doesn't work out, it wasn't meant to be in the first place. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Feeling really low and suicidal </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Just mentioning beforehand that I have thoughts of suicide, just saw a bridge on the way home and was thinking about something random like how big the sign was so close up (I was in a car) and then my mind just immediately switched to wanting to jump. But I have no plans of killing myself as of right now, I just need some words of encouragement so that I don't go any lower.

To start off, I have anxiety and depression and have been diagnosed for about 4 months. I started taking Abilify about a month ago, and the first week of 2 mg I felt great, and then it stopped working after a week. The doctor increased to 5 mg, which worked great again but now I can feel the same thing happening and just not working anymore.

I am currently a pharmacy student and on rotations for 3 weeks. For those who don't know, basically we go to a pharmacy in different settings, hospital for me, and just shadow, learn the job, stuff like that. I'm about halfway into it and I just don't want to do it anymore. This, school, just everything. I made so many mistakes that are probably no big deal but anxiety makes it so much worse. Pharmacists are the last check before a medication goes out to a patient. With anxiety, I doubt my decisions every time and just paranoid that I did something wrong. I don't know what I want to do when I graduate and I have a really bad knee and ankle from a sprain few years ago so I don't know how long my body will hold out in retail (that's where I work at now).

I don't have my psychiatrist appointment until next week, my counseling appointment isn't until Friday  (and he's pretty bad about checking and responding to emails so I don't want to bother him) and I don't want to bother my friend with my problems. I thought about suicide hotline but honestly I didn't find it very personable. I need some support to get the courage to get through...this thought? Day? rest of the week? I just need some encouragement </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was diagnosed with depression and GAD about 4 months ago and at first I easily accepted it, like it explained a huge part of me and my personality. But now I'm having issues coming to terms with it. I know that they're pretty common and a lot of people have it, but I can't help but think that I'm messed up in the brains. I have to keep reminding myself that it's not something that happened overnight and I've been living with this for years, even before I was diagnosed when I thought I was "normal." The self that I thought was normal was me still with these problems but now whenever I have  anxiety attack or think about death I feel like it's something abnormal and external that's just not myself. On one hand I want to treat it like a disease, like diabetes, but on the other hand it's pretty much defined who I am and how I've been living life so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Doing my hospital rotation, that's how I feel. I work at retail and I'll admit it's stressful. I hate doing COVID testing and dread going to work. But I don't know if I like the environment in a hospital. There's no camaraderie, especially none between the techs and pharmacists (maybe it's different in other hospitals). As much as I hate entitled customers, I miss having the interaction and forming relationships with them. And being so used to a fast paced setting, the comparable lack of urgency makes it seem really static especially when you just sit and verify all day. </TEXT>

Yeah unfortunately my mom still doesn’t understand that a lot of my anxiety comes from being a perfectionist and that was because of the way I was raised (she thinks that I’m just being harsh on myself, which is true but you can’t deny the reason I’m still that way). I think she’s accepted the fact that I have these problems and are taking medications but she also thinks that it’ll all go away after the pandemic is over (which may or may not be true, I won’t argue with that).

불안발작 오면 심장이 두근거리고, 엄청나게 더워지고 숨이 가빠요. (When I have anxiety attack, I have heart palpitations, get really hot and shortness of breath)

모든 사람들은 스트레스 받으면 불안증상이 나타나는데 불안장애 있는 사람들은 이유없이 수시로 계속 걱정하게 되고 이런 증상이 나타나요. (Everyone experiences anxiety when they are in a stressful situation, but those with anxiety disorder continue to worry without any reason and have these symptoms.)

This is just me since I'm taking medications

한 3개월동안 상담을 받아왔고 1개월 전에 약먹기 시작했어요. 혼자서 조절을 할수있었으면 약까지는 안먹었을 텐데 어떤 때는 너무심해서 자살생각 까지 했어요. 약없이는 너무 힘들어서 한번 먹어보기로 했는데 도움이 많이 돼었어요. (I've been seeing a counselor since 3 months ago and started taking medications about a month ago. If I could control it by myself I wouldn't have taken medications but it was so hard that I sometimes had suicidal thoughts. It was really hard without medication so I decided to try it and it helped a lot.)

Obviously you have a different situation and what you might want to tell your mom. If you need help fee free to dm me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say it stabilized me a lot. Without it, I was having anxiety attacks and just crying daily without any reason. I would have suicidal thoughts and no motivation, no desire to do anything. Now I have motivation to do things and a lot less anxiety (I still do at work and I still need to take anxiety med when it gets really bad but it's been less frequent). Sometimes I actually look forward to the future, but there are also days I'm scared. It's sometimes still pretty rocky between depression and anxiety but definitely made things better. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Rant about COVID testing </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-06-29 04:53:57 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It's been about a month since starting COVID testing in our store. At first it was okay, that is, when we had adequate hours. But now it's become the thing I dread when I come into work. Here's my insight to COVID testing for those who have had the fortune of not having to deal with it.

1. I would say the biggest thing is hours. We got 70 hours when we started with about 10-20 ish tests/day. A store down the street from us started testing. That cut our demand to about < 10 tests/day and our hours got cut to about 30. And now we're back up to doing over 20 tests, still with 30 hours. Not to mention we've had two full time techs on leave, one new tech training, and just part time students filling in as much hours as we can. It's been hell. Today it was just me and the pharmacist and we got nothing done until we asked for help to one of our techs who came in even though he had worked for 8 days straight trying to cover shifts. They only give hours to cover the testing, they don't even consider the additional phone calls and the burden on lane two.
2. They add more and more stuff that takes more time to do, and still gives us 10 minute windows to get everything done. At first it was pretty simple, ask few questions about insurance, consent for PHI release and then just get on with testing. Now we have to upload insurance images on some phone type machine (don't know what those are called) that doesn't even zoom in. So you have to ask the patients to get out of the car and put their insurance card against the window. And majority of the time they don't like that. Not to mention it takes forever to upload them. Which brings to my next point.
3. Crappy speakers in drive thru. They are the worst. You ask for primary care doctor? You can't even understand what they are saying. Social security number of insurance card ID number? Can't understand a word. It's hard enough trying to sell prescriptions with that crappy speakerphone, trying to take down information that requires accuracy is so much harder.

Now this is more about the patients

1. Those who come in the store after testing without a mask and touching everything. If you think you might have COVID and got tested for it, don't come in the store.
2. People who come to the wrong store for their test. This happens with prescriptions all the time too. I get it, the road name's the same, but at least make sure beforehand which store you're going to and don't assume.
3. People who come 20 minutes before their test and getting mad when I tell them they have to come back. I told them there is someone who is supposed to have their test done before them but they still got angry that I was making them (god forbid) come at the time they signed up for. Do they go to doctor's office 30 minutes early and ask to meet with the doctor at that moment?
4. People lying about having an appointment. This happened to us today. There were two people in line who said they were supposed to have their test done at 11 am. We checked with the store down the street, checked at different stores, nothing. The lady told me that she had a confirmation text but when my pharmacist asked to see it, she said she couldn't. Eventually she left and came back 40 minutes later with an actual appointment. When we say no on demand testing, there is no on demand testing. Plain and simple. There is nothing we can do without your name in our system, so stop wasting our time and just go sign up on our website. It's not that hard. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does anyone have trouble staying asleep while on Abilify?

I would wake up at least 3-4 times a day, sometimes every 2 hours and I would be so exhausted in the morning that I would sleep all day (in increments of 2-3 hour naps). I’ve tried melatonin and my psychiatrist thought that increasing the dose might help but I’m still having this issue because he thought it was from my anxiety . Just trying to see if it’s me or if it’s a side effect from the medication </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's worse when your fellow pharmacy workers do it to you.

Long story short I'm in the state where 3 letter is acquiring a local chain and they've converted about couple days ago. Each store has their own converting "deadline" but there was this one store in particular. I think ours was the closest one, so instead of dealing with the workflow, they sent all their customers to our store, telling them that their prescriptions will be ready when they got here.

I get that they're not familiar with the computer system (even though they had months to convert and familiarize themselves with it) and that it's gonna be chaos on the first day of conversion. But we're the only 24/7 pharmacy in the area, one of the busiest in the district and already doing covid testing. At least let us know that they are sending all these patients over so that we can at least be prepared for them and try our best to get them done before they come. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’ve been taking Abilify for depression and anxiety for about 10 days now. For the first week it was great, I had motivation and didn’t feel as depressed and didn’t need my anxiety medication. And then about 2 or 3 days ago I was at work and it was really stressful (I work retail) and I had a small anxiety attack which was the first time I really noticed it at work. So the next day at work I knew it was going to be stressful so I took klonopin before going in and it helped a lot. Now I feel like Abilify isn’t even working anymore. I feel hopeless and depressed and randomly crying. I have more anxiety and while haven’t had suicidal thoughts, I feel like they’re going to come again.

Is it normal for the medication to stop working after a week when you’re first starting it? It’s the best one I’ve tried so far aside from Zoloft and trazodone and the only thing that made me hesitant was that it kept making me wake up 3-4 times a night so I’m exhausted by morning. But I was honestly surprised that it was effective within few days of taking it especially because it takes a few weeks for full benefits. </TEXT>

<TEXT> That happens all the time for me, every time I fight with my mom or something happens my mind always resorts to suicide. When I was in really bad depression it would be my "solution" to everything and way out and even though I'm doing better my mind still goes to those thoughts. My therapist says that it's so ingrained in my mind, like a habit that even though something that is less big of a deal happens my mind will go straight to that thought. It's a process of retraining your mind to think about things other than suicide and learn to stop suing avoidance as a coping strategy </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took Zoloft for 2 weeks as my first med. Same with you, I had no anxiety but probably because my brain was out of energy to think about stuff. I had no motivation or energy to do anything the entire time so I slept all day except to go to work. I had a lot of suicidal thoughts and that’s when the doctor who was a GP decided I should probably see a psychiatrist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is just my experience with CVS hiring. So it took me about 2 years to get a job end of fall semester of P1 year). I applied as an intern at one store which I didn’t get the job, and tech at another, which is the one I work at now. When I got hired as a tech I went through background check and everything and then they told me I had to reapply as an intern since I was in pharmacy school. So I did and got hired again as intern after 2 months. I’ve heard people apply and never hear back for the intern position, I think that the fact that the store was desperate for a tech helped me get hired. You could start off as a cashier, but both tech and cashier are entry level jobs, go for the tech position if you can. </TEXT>

When I stopped that and took trazodone, it made things so much better. I had more motivation and energy. When I had to get off of trazodone I could definitely see a difference.

<TEXT> I had a similar time once. It was my friend's birthday and she invited her close friends, who I wasn't really close with, she was my only friend at the time. I don't know if I have social anxiety but I have a really hard time meeting new people and getting along with them. I wanted to be there for her but at the same time I didn't think I could handle it. So when my job needed someone to cover, I volunteered. I kind of forgot/kind of didn't that our plan was that day. I heard they had fun and I sometimes regret not going. I eventually ended up being good friends with them, except one of them ended up moving schools and the other had a fight/conflict and just fell out, so it's just me and her.

There was another time after that, again it was her birthday and we were going to go to a restaurant. At first it was going to be a few close friends but her boyfriend invited his friend group, who we weren't really close with but I was really uncomfortable with them. I told my friend and we arranged it so that I could be more comfortable. We had 2 tables where I was with my friends and the other people were with their group and it worked out.

You could maybe talk to your friends and express your concerns. Maybe they could do something. You could also avoid the situation, but I don't think that's a desirable option for you it seems like. Or you could just face it and who knows, maybe you might end up liking them. Through experience, I found that talking with my friend was the best option. She understood how I felt and changed things to accommodate me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to put a trigger warning here.

My mom, me and my brother moved to a different country when I was young so I pretty much lost my dad in my life. My parents would fight all the time so whenever my mom needed something from my dad, she would always make me call him and then he would yell at me. Being an Asian my mom always had high standards for my grades and physically and emotionally abused me from when I was little throughout high school until I lived on campus in college. My brother sexually abused me for a period of time when I was little and I hate his guts. And then I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety before the quarantine started and being back home made it a lot worse that I was struggling with suicidal thoughts. </TEXT>

Even during undergrad years in college I had no idea I had anxiety and I would joke about killing myself all the time but actually meant it. I only got help from the counseling centers after 22 years into my life because there were multiple people who were concerned about me and told me to get help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first time I can say for sure it was a panic attack was when I was looking at my phone just scrolling through facebook. I think I was about a week in taking sertraline, which was the first medicine I ever took. I got hot really suddenly out of the blue and had trouble breathing, which at that point I thought I had COVID. My heart was beating really hard and I just couldn't shift my thoughts to anything else. It went away after couple of minutes and that's when I realized I had my first panic attack. I haven't had any since that's as bad but it did scare me.

Panic attacks do come differently for each person but it sounds a lot like a panic attack to me. Something probably worth mentioning to your doctor/psychiatrist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression 3 months ago and struggled a lot with suicidal thoughts since the quarantine. I tried couple of medications, sertraline, trazodone for depression + insomnia and clonazepam. Sertraline made me really depressed and no energy, trazodone gave me bad stomach issues and clonazepam helped with anxiety but my anxiety and depression skyrocketed when I didn't take the medication (even though it was less than a week of taking it so it couldn't have been dependence on it). And then about of week ago I started taking Abilify (aripiprazole) and so far it's been the best out of everything I've tried. It could be that I was just working more than usual but i haven't have had very bad side effects other than occasional wave of dizziness. There would be moments at work where I would start to get an anxiety attack or suddenly lose the motivation but it being a retail nature and a stressful job, it's something to be expected. I haven't actively thought about suicide for the past 5 days I took the medication, but then could be from just being busy and exhausted from working 40 hours vs. 20 that I usually work. So things were ok, I was tired of going to work every day but other than that I would say my mental health has been relatively stable.

I had my counseling session today and it was good, it wasn't particularly upsetting or anything. But every single time my counselor says "I care about you and I want you to live a happy and long life," I don't want to. I don't care if I die tomorrow, I don't really want to be happy (I don't even know what makes me happy) and I don't really want to live that long. I've been in the slumps for weeks, there were 2 incidences where I would have attempted suicide and I finally feel "better" but I still feel that way. Apathy might be the right word. This is the most motivation and energy I've had for 3 months, my best friend stopped by my work yesterday and made me so happy but I just don't care. I don't particularly look forward to the future but I can finally think about it without panicking or starting to cry. I've been feeling more positive about going back to school in the fall and just getting my life together again but that feeling is still there.

I've been reading about anxiety and depression trying to make sense of it and trying to understand why I feel or act certain ways. But it's a pretty complicated subject and even harder to diagnose. My psychiatrist mentioned that there might be something more than just anxiety and depression but he doesn't know yet. Is this feeling normal with depression or is there something more complicated? </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, seeing a psychiatrist was kind of similar to seeing a therapist except they’re more objective. They will ask you questions like what symptoms you have and then go into details like when it started and what might have triggered it. My psychiatrist was more in depth because obviously he’s trying to make a diagnosis instead of using therapy to help you cope with situations. My therapist diagnosed me with anxiety, my psychiatrist diagnosed me with anxiety and depression and thinks that there’s more. A lot of their focus is on finding the problem and using medication to treat it so the approach and focus on emotions may be different </TEXT>

The day after I felt so much better and maybe taking trazodone may have helped but it gave me bad stomach issues. So now I’ve been on Abilify which I thought was interesting because it’s an adjunctive with SSRI, not usually a monotherapy for depression but it’s better than when I was taking klonopin alone for anxiety. I still get moments when I get really sad and lose motivation but also want to lash out at people especially at work but hard to tell since I’ve only been on it for 4 days </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts for years, more frequently recently with the quarantine. There was a time a month ago when I started a medication and it made me so depressed that I wanted to jump off a bridge even though I had a great time at work. The next time was when I stopped being on an antidepressant and my anxiety and depression was skyrocketing and I had a conflict with my mom. I felt that I had no future and really nothing to live for. I wanted to take all the medications I had and overdose.

Each time there was always someone who stopped me. The first time I sent an email to my counselor and he talked to me over an hour on the phone outside of his business time trying to make sure I was okay. The second time I took a walk thinking that I would just go somewhere and never come back. I saw a friend who works at my school and haven’t seen him since the quarantine started. Seeing him made that thought go away.

Then I started on a new medication few days ago. I started working more. It’s not perfect and I still have moments where I lose all my motivation or just want to lash out at people. But it’s so much better. Even my lows aren’t the lowest I’ve been in. I haven’t had a suicidal thought since the last time, which is about 5 days, but still better than having them daily.

Please get help. It truly gets better. Take some medication and it might not be perfect or even work the first time but it can make things easier. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you don't drink alcohol as much or often (and by a lot, I mean more than 3 drinks per day ), taking acetaminophen once after drinking isn't going to produce a lasting damage. The danger with taking tylenol and alcohol is the risk of liver damage. There is a substance produced by liver that reduces the toxicity of acetaminophen and alcohol as it is cleared from the body. When you take Tylenol and alcohol together, they can rapidly deplete this substance, resulting in toxicity to the liver. But this is more likely to occur when you drink a lot and take tylenol daily. If you're  someone who drinks on a social basis or take painkillers every once in a while for headaches or occasional pain, you don't have to worry about this. It would depend on your body, race and all that, but generally about half of the alcohol is cleared after 4 hours. So if you wanted to be cautious, you could wait about 4 hours before taking Tylenol. If you got drunk and woke up the next day with a hangover and a killer headache, it would be safe to take Tylenol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I usually just calculate everything. I never assume the day supply.

For ear and eye drops, we use 20 drops per mL
If the patient is using 2 drops per day and we give them 5 mL
5 x 20 = 100 drops
100/2= 50 days

For inhalers, I always check how many puffs each inhaler has, some has 120, some has 200
If the patient uses 2 puffs every 4 hours with 200 puffs on the inhaler
2x6 = 12 puffs/day
200/12 = 16 days supply

Of course some Insurances won’t like it if you go over 30 days supply or have some specific days supply they will cover. In that case, I would just change 50 to 30 days supply or maybe change to 2.5 mL dispensed which would equate to about 25 days </TEXT>

My coping mechanism all my life was denial. For every traumatic thing that happened, all the abuse from childhood, I stored them away deep in my brain.

<TEXT> I take klonopin, I was scared about dependence too, but my psychiatrist said that he won’t leave me on it too long. I had to take 0.5 mg twice daily for about a week while I got the Zoloft and trazodone out of my system except that my anxiety and depression was skyrocketing with benzodiazepine alone so he put me on Abilify. I’m hoping to go back to taking as needed. But I will say that it has helped a lot. I would have bad anxiety attacks and cry daily and it helped me calmed down, but kind of made me feel empty. Even today at work I was getting overwhelmed and just hated people (I work in retail pharmacy and we get a lot of interesting people) and just taking one tablet made the rest of my shift tolerable. But yeah if you can, you really shouldn’t mess with this stuff. I’ve seen people at the pharmacy who has to get early fills every month and get so much benzodiazepines and honestly I don’t want to become one of those people. Not to mention I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts and having a whole bunch isn’t a good idea when you know so much about drugs and overdose </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pharmacy student here - the reason why you shouldn’t take Zoloft with ibuprofen is due to risk of GI bleeding. Ibuprofen blocks the enzyme that protects the GI lining and serotonin seems to increase bleeding. However, if you are taking ibuprofen every once in a while (not every day for months), you’re going to be fine. And especially at a lower dose for Zoloft, it’s unlikely to happen. However, if you do have a history of GI bleeding related to NSAIDs or medications or are still uncomfortable with it, go with Tylenol. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who works in a pharmacy, usually we’re able to give you a couple of pills while waiting for a new script from the doctor and just take those out from the new script. Citalopram isn’t a controlled substance (at least in the US) so that shouldn’t be a big problem. Meanwhile, see if you can send a message to the doctor through an online portal if you have one or talk to a nurse who can maybe send over a script to hold you until your appointment. If not, another option I can think of is going to an urgent care, sometimes they are able to prescribe a maintenance medication for one time </TEXT>

M (me) and MK (milder Karen)

M: Thank you for calling 3-letter pharmacy how can I help you?

MK: There's a script there for me, I need you to cancel it. I'm picking it up at a different pharmacy.

M: Sure it looks like there's one in process and one that's also ready.

MK: Cancel that too.

M: Alright it should be good to go at the pharmacy you're at.

Before I hang up, I hear her say "I'm here to pick up a script" and then I hang up.

Few minutes later, I hear my coworker working the drive thru say her name and the medication that I told her that would be ready.

M: Wait, is her name MK?

C (coworker): Yeah, she's got omeprazole.

M: She literally called me a minute ago saying she was picking that up at a different pharmacy and told me to cancel it.

And then she ended up sitting at the drive thru staring at us the whole time bitching about how she had to wait for the prescription on hold to be filled because like she told me, I canceled her order.

&#x200B;

TL;DR lady calls the wrong pharmacy thinking that she's canceling the refill at a different pharmacy when she actually cancelled her order at the one she just arrived at to pick up her scripts </TEXT>

I've been hiding everything from my mom, from lying about phone calls I had to make, scheduling appointments to when my mom wasn't at home and paying for my medications with gift card/cash (I don't have a car but it helped that I work in a pharmacy). I tried to make all communications from my insurance company and the student health center electronic too so that I wouldn't get mail but it seems that the student health center's system wasn't coordinated with the hospital that the psychiatrist was associated with. I got a bill in the mail and my mom asked me what it was for. I could have lied and said it was a bill from about a year or 2 ago that wasn't taken care of. But I was already lying about all this and I knew the truth had to get out sometime, especially when my mom sees over $100 charges on my bank account. But I wasn't expecting her to find out this early, and certainly not this way.

I had to go to work so it was a pretty brief conversation. It happened so suddenly that I don't remember everything but I think it was mostly about why I didn't tell her. There's a lot of reasons. I wanted to be in control of my own health. I didn't want her to constantly ask me if I took my medicine or if I even picked up my medicine. I was just so sick of her interfering with the littlest thing that I just wanted to have a part of my life that was just my own. The second reason is, I guess a lot of people can relate, the stigma on mental health. But I didn't tell her any of this. The biggest thing was how do I tell someone that they are the reason for me being this way? How can I explain that I have depression and anxiety and have had suicidal thoughts since 10 because of all the trauma and abuse? She asked why, but I just simply couldn't say anything beyond the fact that she was the reason for a lot of the stress I had. She ended up crying and of course I felt horrible so I ended up crying. And this was the final reason, I didn't want her to worry. As much as I hated the way the relationship was right now, I didn't want her to try to be "nicer" because after all these years, it couldn't just erase all the pain and just would have made things weird.

During work I was thinking about all this and what to say. After, I explained what I was going through and why I felt that taking the medication was necessary. I got through 20 years of my life, I guess "mentally strong" as my mom says. I just bottled up all my emotions and tried to be strong because I always had that sense of responsibility of keeping my family together even though I was the youngest sibling. But as my counselor told me, it got me through 20 years of my life, but it just simply stopped working. It was a good coping mechanism for a while, but it isn't anymore and that's why I'm mentally in this position today. But my mom thinks I'm not mentally strong enough and I'm too sensitive. She talked about how she was going through all this too, with anxiety but she didn't have to take medication. I felt that I needed medication because I was having panic/anxiety attacks daily and just really bad suicidal thoughts almost daily. There are times I came close, and quite frankly, medication isn't the reason I'm still alive. I'm still struggling to find the right medication and sometimes I just want to give up because it is painful to hit rock bottom, get better and hit rock bottom again. But I certainly couldn't die because of everyone who wanted me alive and if I didn't even have the hope of medication making me feel better, I don't know, maybe I would be dead or at least attempted to die.

What came out of this conversation? What was I even expecting? There were times I wanted to tell her everything. But with withholding my emotions and with the language barrier, it was almost impossible to really say what I felt. And today's conversation was a fraction of what I've told my counselor and what I want my mom to understand. I realized that this is probably the limit to what I can tell her. I tried my best, but one moment isn't going to break the barriers that I've built around myself for years. I know that she still doesn't believe in medication. She thinks that my anxiety and depression just comes from the fact that I don't have anything to do because school's over and that getting a boyfriend will make things better. She thinks that I was too quick to jump to medication. To be honest, I didn't want to take medications either. I guess it just affirmed that my problem wasn't just simple as talking to a counselor. But I felt like I needed it. And I know I need it. I was off of antidepressants just for few days and on benzodiazepine for anxiety alone and I could feel my anxiety/depression and suicidal thoughts just skyrocketing. But she'll never understand that. An hour's conversation isn't going to scratch the surface of what I've been struggling to understand about myself for months. I guess if anything came out of it, I don't need to hide the fact that I'm taking a medication. She will probably freak out once rest of my bills come in and find out I need to keep seeing my psychiatrist. And this will probably be the last conversation I have with my mom about my mental health. Because it's just too painful for me to talk about it and she'll never understand fully. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest with you (not saying I appreciate this), if it wasn't for the potential to get the COVID part, the work's not that bad. I would prefer to call patients to preregister them on the phone than to deal with PCQ calls and yelling patients who doesn't understand how their insurance works. Except for the very few people who come to get the test who refuse to listen and end up messing up, they're way more decent than the regulars who come to pick up their scripts </TEXT>

<TEXT> It can be habit forming if you take it long term. It would depend on the dose you take, how often and how long. I guess the benefits would outweigh the risk if it really helps you with anxiety, like you can’t function because of your anxiety attacks and the doctor was very cautious on how long they have you on it for and was really conservative with it. I know that it can be tempting to just take it for little things but you would also have to be conscious on how much you take </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry to hear that. I'm Asian and there's a lot of stigma around mental health and medications too. I've been lying about my psychiatrist and counseling appointments (which is all telehealth) to my mom saying that it's a meeting with my professors. I work in a pharmacy so I'm fortunate to be able to pick up my medications after work but honestly I'm scared that my mom will see over $100 charge on my credit card for my medical bills. I tried to cover up everything, from making everything through email instead of paper mail and paying cash/gift cards.

There's a couple of options I can think of but I don't know if it'll be possible for you.

1. Get a 3 month supply so that you can make the supply last until you can go back to school
2. Instead of using insurance, ask if they have a discount card they can apply. GoodRx might be an option too, you can just search GoodRx on google and look for your medication. Sometimes it's cheaper than insurance, sometimes it's not. But sertraline typically is a cheaper medication than most. I don't know what pharmacy you use and the prices tend to vary according to the pharmacy (and some may not even accept them so be sure to ask) but from what I can see, #90 of 100 mg is around $38 at the highest (price may fluctuate too so you would have to see for yourself).
3. Is there a friend who can pick up your medications or get them mailed (to your friend's house if you're not comfortable having it delivered to your house)? </TEXT>

<TITLE> Experience with Abilify </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-06-10 22:07:21 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I'm not sure if Abilify (aripiprazole) count under antidepressants since it's an antipsychotic or if anyone's used it for depression/anxiety.

Long story short I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression 3 months ago and started sertraline about a month ago. After 2 weeks of sertraline I was taken off because I had really bad depression and what I thought was worsening suicidal thoughts (might have just been me, I don't know). Then I tried trazodone for a week, which helped a little bit but gave me stomach issues. I've been taking clonazepam for about a week now twice a day, and it's helped with whenever I would have a bad anxiety attack pretty much daily and cry but it hasn't helped me with insomnia from anxiety. Not being on any antidepressant has actually made my depression and anxiety worse.

Anyway I had an appointment with the psychiatrist today and he thinks there's more than just depression and anxiety but he can't figure out what it is. So he's trying me on Abilify and pretty much told me a common side effect is nausea. Other than that I really don't know too much about it and just want some input in other people's experiences because it's not something I see too much on here. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be honest with you, finding the right antidepressant can be a long journey. So far I've tried sertraline, which made my depression really bad and left me with no energy, and trazodone, which helped, but gave me bad stomach problems. I take clonazepam, which is a benzodiazepine, kind of a short term med for relieving symptoms of anxiety attacks. the clonzepam helped me with anxiety attacks, but didn't really do much in terms of my depression. Without any antidepressants I found that my anxiety and suicidal thoughts were really bad. So as much as I haven't found one that works for me yet, I know that I truly need something to function normally. If you asked me 3 months ago before the quarantine happened I would have said I'm fine without any medications, but now things have gotten so bad that I know that I need it.

If you aren't seeing any therapist, that would be the first option to try. Often times therapy can help you feel better, and they may be able to help you decide if you do need medications. Antidepressants aren't something that's addictive. The reason people say it's hard to get off of is because sometimes when they go off of it, they go back to being depressed again. And even when you go off of it, you need to titrate and lower the dose gradually to let your brain get used to the change so that you don't experience withdrawal symptoms. Some people take it for years, some people are able to go off it after a year or so. It really depends on how you feel.

On the other hand, benzodiazepines, which are anti-anxiolytics (for anxiety attacks) can be more addictive. That's why they aren't used long term and should be used with caution. Typically anxiety can be managed with antidepressants and doctors won't prescribe you a benzodiazepine unless you have really bad panic/anxiety attacks.

At the end of the day, if you feel like your depression and anxiety is preventing you to live your life like you want to and is really bad, it's something worth trying. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Worsening panic/anxiety attacks, depression and suicidal thoughts are black box warnings for antidepressants, especially if you're under the age of 25. Even if you don't stop now, it's definitely something you should tell your doctor. I took zoloft for 2 weeks and I had really bad depression with no energy to get out of bed except to go to work. I finally realized that it was getting really bad when I had a great day at work and all I could think about was jumping from a bridge. The doctor took me off of it and within a day or 2 of stopping, I felt so much better. I had more motivation and energy to do things. It may be a just a side effect that may go away, or maybe a sign that this isn't for you. Definitely talk to your doctor.

I tried trazodone after because I had insomnia from all the anxiety when I was in bed. It worked great and I felt happier after just a week except for really bad stomachaches and diarrhea waking me up every morning. And as of right now I'm only on clonazepam which helps with calming down especially because I've been having really bad anxiety attacks/depression daily after being off of antidepressants. It helps with symptoms but definitely not for actually increasing serotonin levels to elevate my mood in general. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a similar feeling a while ago, not with medication but with therapy. I thought therapy was supposed to be easy, you know, like you talk about your feelings and it makes you feel better. I didn't know that I would be reliving years of abuse and bringing up memories of trauma and end up breaking down by the end of the session. And sometimes I wondered if it was worth it all, like if I didn't have to think about all this and lived my life as it was, I could at be happy, maybe not all the time but at least in a way I knew how (like how ignorance is bliss).

My counselor told me that sticking with the status quo has worked so far. After all, I'm still alive. But I'm here, doing therapy because it no longer works anymore. There's a point where all the coping mechanism just doesn't work anymore, and that's when things go downhill.

It's similar with medications. There's that sense of normal before medications. But eventually, there will be a time where it won't be the same. The more you leave anxiety untreated, the more likely it can lead to depression and other conditions, such as hypertension or stroke. Medication might change you at first in ways you don't want to, but it will help stabilize the level of serotonin in your brain so that you can function better and have less anxiety.

I will admit that the first medication I tried, sertraline, was a really bad choice for me. It made me really depressed and suicidal all within 2 weeks. I had no energy to get up to do anything and no motivation. I stopped taking it and started taking trazodone instead. That made me so much better, so much closer to my "normal self," except that I had to stop it because it gave me stomach issues.

Choosing an antidepressant is a journey. Sometimes you need to try a whole bunch of medications before you find one that works for you. If something makes you feel off and not like yourself, you can try different one. But at the end of the day, it will help you feel much better. </TEXT>

<TEXT> GI symptoms are pretty common with antidepressants. I would say flatulence with strong odor is common. How would you describe your stool? Almost tarry, like blackish? Or just really dark brown like you sometimes get with diarrhea? The reason I'm asking is because effexor may lead to GI bleeding, which is not very common (< 2%). From how you're described it I don't think it's GI bleeding and probably not serious but if you're really concerned you could ask your pharmacist/doctor. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This reminded me of a facebook post I saw today and it resonated with me a lot.

[https://imgur.com/a/hLJMZi4](https://imgur.com/a/hLJMZi4)

When I first started seeing a counselor for school related stress and anxiety, I thought it would be so simple. I would learn how to cope and manage my stress and stop freaking out. Little did I know that I would bring out memories of years of trauma and abuse from my childhood. Some sessions would go smoothly and some would be really rough that I would cry by the end. I've been one of the worst depressive episodes I've had from having to relive those moments especially with my mom and on the edge of committing suicide. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth making my life complicated by thinking of all these things and sometimes it's putting me in a worse place than I was in before. Sometimes my counselor tells me I've grown so much but I can't feel it.

One thing is that I do know more about myself. I don't know what I'll do with this knowledge but it's a process of healing and getting better </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately my mom is the same way. She works in a store in predominantly black community. She got hurt once trying to stop someone from stealing and just constantly goes on about how if they tried harder they would be in a better place (like "model minority" we are right?) At this point, I've given up and just want to avoid any more conflict because I know it will trigger my anxiety attack again. The best thing is to focus on what we can do. It is our generation, and we will determine how the society will be years from now. Just like breaking the cycle of parental abuse, we should work on breaking the cycle of racism by changing our attitude and mindset. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My counselor said that they're very much related to each other. Sometimes your anxiety is so bad and you worry about something so much that you get depressed that you can't do anything about it. I think that anxiety and depression are linked to each other for me. I first found out I had anxiety by talking to a counselor. I think that things got so bad that I had no control over my anxiety and had a lot of depressive/suicidal thoughts because I couldn't solve any of the problems. I got diagnosed with depression too when I saw a doctor for anxiety. After taking SSRI for 2 weeks I was in a really bad depression where I had no energy to do anything, laid in bed/slept all day but surprisingly kept my anxiety away mostly because I had no energy to think/worry about anything. I tried trazodone after that and stopped it after a week because it gave me stomach issues. After stop taking antidepressants, I can definitely feel my anxiety coming back. I would have physical symptoms, even if it's not anxious thoughts. I'm taking clonazepam for anxiety and it relieves the symptoms, doesn't really help with serotonin levels.

Sorry it's probably confusing. Long story short depression can come with anxiety, or they can clash with each other where you're too depressed and have no energy to have anxious thoughts.

There are SNRI's - similar to SSRI but it also affects norepinephrine more

atypical antidepressants like trazodone which is also taken for insomnia

benzodiazepines if you have bad panic/anxiety attacks and need immediate relief

 TCA's or MAOI's </TEXT>

<TEXT> Does anyone get a feeling of comfort in depression?

I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about 2 months ago and started taking medication about a month ago. It helped me with anxiety but made my depression really bad, like I would lie in my bed all day and sleep to get away. Maybe the depression made me so out of energy that I couldn't even worry about things. 2 weeks after taking sertraline my doctor decided to take me off of it because I was actually thinking about jumping from a bridge. Since then, I've felt so much better, but it doesn't feel right. I have more motivation to do things, still get depressed on a daily basis but I have more energy. Probably because I'm less depressed, I've had more anxiety and I just worry about the future and all the things I have to do for school with no answer. I don't want to say I'm self-destructive but at the same time I want to go back to the days where I would lay in bed and not think about anything and everything was simple. Even the suicidal thoughts gave me some comfort because it gave me a way out of my problems like a solution, whereas I don't have any answers and that makes me more anxious.

Does anyone else have these kinds of thoughts or am I just weird? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Benzodiazepines are generally used if you have really bad panic attacks and it helps relieve symptoms, not recommended for long term use, but sometimes used daily for some conditions. I got prescribed some but honestly I’d rather not start it than to try to quit later.

Trazodone is useful if you have insomnia. It’s an antidepressant but the side effect of drowsiness helps with sleeping. Unfortunately for me it knocked me out for 16 hours the first day I took it and just been giving me stomach problems.

SSRI/SNRI are more long term, takes about 4-6 weeks (could be less for some) for benefits. There’s a wide range of medications and act differently for each person. Sertraline was the first antidepressant I tried and it worsened my depression and increased suicidal thoughts after 2 weeks.

People can tell you all about their experiences and they can be helpful. But it doesn’t mean it’ll be the same for you. Antidepressants work differently for everyone and like the other person, it’s just trial and error </TEXT>

<TEXT> Basically there are neurons in your brain, which transmits signals and messages. Between each neuron is a synapse. Synapse is basically a space between 2 neurons. On one side you have a neuron sending signals and on the other side you have the receiving side of the message. And in this case, the message (hormone) that you are transmitting is serotonin, which makes you feel better along with other functions. The goal of SSRI is to increase the amount of serotonin that reaches the receiving neuron.

There's also something called reuptake. The neuron sending out the serotonin takes some of the serotonin back, decreasing the amount of serotonin that reaches the receiving neuron. SSRIs inhibit the reuptake, so that there is increased amount of serotonin reaching the receiving neuron.

Hope that helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that it is because diabetes is more objective whereas depression is subjective. You can measure diabetes in terms of A1c or blood glucose and associate that with actual physical signs such as kidney or nerve damage. With depression, there really isn't an objective measure that can detect the presence of the condition. Everything is based off the patient's perception of mood and symptoms. It's similar with other conditions that don't have an objective way to detect it, like migraines or fibromyalgia.

And even more, people think they understand what depression is when they really don't. The word "depressed" gets thrown out so easily. Everyone feels sad every once in a while, maybe even more intense grief if you lose someone really close to you, but that doesn't mean they actually have depression. Because they just think that being depressed is same as being sad, they think that it's something you can control if you try hard enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is one of the theories. Basically SSRI's increase serotonin in the synapse. When there is an overabundance of serotonin, your brain does something called downregulation where it decreases the number of receptors in order to match increased serotonin. Because there are less serotonin receptors, your body is basically receiving less serotonin, leading to low mood and depression.

There's another theory I read couple of weeks ago but I can't find it at the moment. SSRI's increase serotonin but also decrease another hormone which can impact mood (I think it's dopamine). Basically dopamine is responsible for a lot of things, including desire. It could be that the time it takes for SSRIs to decrease dopamine enough to make you feel depressed is much shorter than the time it requires to increase serotonin enough to boost your mood, so you feel more depressed when you initiate treatment. </TEXT>

I’m sorry you’re struggling with this. I know it sucks, but it will go away. Just focus on getting through the moment. And then if possible and if you haven’t already, get professional help. Talk to a therapist about your anxiety issues and coping skills. If you’re willing to take medications, find a doctor who can prescribe you something.

<TITLE> First antidepressant experience with Zoloft </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-05-28 09:04:51 </DATE>

<TEXT> TW: suicide

I started Zoloft 2 weeks ago for anxiety and depression. About 2 days in I had really bad depression where I didn’t feel like doing anything, didn’t find joy in life and just sleeping all day. I had relatively mild side effects (other than depression) with decreased appetite and nausea when I increased from 25 to 50.

3 days ago I was coming home from work, and I was having a pretty good day so far. I work in retail pharmacy, no one really yelled at me, it wasn’t too busy and I had a great time with my boss. I saw a bridge and got really sad and just thought about jumping. I didn’t obviously, but that was when I realized my depression was getting out of control. Even before then I was looking up ways to die so I emailed my therapist that night. He got really concerned that I would kill myself and just talked with me for an hour on the phone and made sure I was okay. The next day I got an appointment with my doctor and a referral to a psychiatrist. And today, the psychiatrist took me off of Zoloft and put me on trazodone and clonazapem.

I honestly didn’t expect to have a serious problem with sertraline and actually thought it helped a little with anxiety. I’m very hesitant about taking clonazapem because as someone who works in a pharmacy, I know how serious drug dependence can be and I’m hoping I won’t ever have to take it.

That’s my very short lived experience with Zoloft and for those trying it for the first time or struggling to see any benefits, hang in there. Hopefully you’ll have a better experience than I did, but if not, you’ll find something that works. My heart goes out to everyone who is struggling </TEXT>

<TEXT> TW: suicide

TL;DR unintentionally made my counselor think I was going to kill myself when I wasn't

Since about 2 weeks ago when I started sertraline, I was really depressed, had no motivation and basically slept to escape from reality. The only thing that I could manage to do was go to work, I was either lying in bed sleeping or scrolling through facebook mindlessly. I didn't associate it with the medication, I thought it was just me but now that I think about it, it's probably from the medication. So yesterday I went to work and had a pretty great day. I work in retail pharmacy and it wasn't too busy, no one really yelled at me and I had a lot of fun with my boss. But on the way home, there's a bridge and I just had a thought that it would be nice to not have to worry about anything anymore. I was already having anxiety about having to move homes and summer classes and I thought life was too complicated and didn't want to deal with anything. And that day I realized that my depression was getting worse because I had a great day and still had that thought. I emailed my counselor last night/this morning around 2 am because I had a really bad headache so it took like 2 hours to write that email.

So today, my counselor emailed me back and I was half asleep reading that email. I completely missed the part where he wanted me to email him back ASAP. About 3 hours later he sent another email telling me to call him so I did and he was really concerned and thought that I was going to kill myself tonight. Which I understand his concern and I probably phrased things in that email like I wanted to die. He wanted me to go to the hospital (which I understand) but I had to refuse because my mom didn't know I was going through anxiety and depression and didn't want to make her worry too. He made me call a crisis hotline. I had to call him back after and he asked me if I could promise him not to kill myself tonight and I said yes. He said "you're lying" with such certainty that I was kind of taken aback. I wasn't thinking about the whole email until then and certainly had no plans to kill myself. I understand why he might have thought that but that statement made me feel awful. I have moments where I get really depressed in addition to already low mood and have suicidal ideations but when it goes away I don't feel that awful. I was having an okay day, just sleeping as usual and now I feel so awful for making him worry. I could hear in his voice that he was really concerned (like not his cheerful self). I feel like a burden on him and even though I know it's his job I don't know if I feel comfortable especially talking about suicidal thoughts with him. On one hand I want to get it off my chest but at the same time I don't want to make him worried like today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have it both ways, sometimes I would spend hours worrying and thinking about something and sometimes I would repress the thoughts in which case it comes physically like you said. Honestly it feels more normal to worry about something and freaks me out when I don’t worry but have physical symptoms. It’s probably just me but when I’m more depressed I tend to push my thoughts away because I don’t even have the mental capacity to worry about stuff and just don’t care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don’t take beta blockers but I’m a pharmacy student. Generally nonselective beta blockers (works on both beta 1 and 2) are not recommended for asthma because blocking beta 2 specifically can lead to bronchospasm, basically an asthma attack. Commonly propranolol and atenolol are prescribed for anxiety, propranolol is nonselective whereas atenolol is beta 1 selective. At high doses of atenolol it can also work on beta 2 but at low doses it should be fine. You can ask your doctor about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was on 25 mg for 4 days and then increased to 50 mg. The first day I took 50 mg I had nausea but it went away after that (I usually take it after eating too so that could have helped). I had decreased appetite for 2-3 days but that's gone away too. The only thing that's really bothered me was depression, but I'm not sure if that's just myself or the medication. Other than that I've spent the last 2 weeks just sleeping all day but it's starting to get better. I think it's helped a lot with anxiety and panic attacks, like they aren't as frequent and as severe but still waiting to see if it's working for my depression. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's 2 type of medications you can take, one for immediate symptom relief (meds such as alprazolam, diazepam or lorazepam) or one that is more long term but help stabilize the hormones in your brain (SSRI, SNRI etc). The ones for immediate relief have more abuse potential, and is generally not used for long term, but you can be on it for more severe symptoms. Meds such as SSRIs or SNRIs aren't as "addicting" and have low abuse potential. The reason why you can't really quit cold turkey isn't because it's addicting, but you have to let your brain get used to decrease in dosage so you don't get withdrawal symptoms. This is done by tapering over a certain number of weeks. I've seen people who are able to completely go off of it after a while, and some that really need it for longer time. So whether you completely stop taking the medication is up to you and your doctor. Usually it takes about  4-6 weeks to see full effect, could be less for some people, and it's recommended to decrease dose by tapering if you've been taking it for more than 4 weeks.

I want to say first that how you react to the medication is different for everyone. You might find that the medication is the perfect one or you might find that it doesn't work. For a lot of people it takes a lot of trials to find a working medication, so it might take some time to actually find one for you. So don't give up even if you don't feel like it's doing anything for you.

That being said, here's my take on it. I'm taking sertraline for anxiety and depression, which is a SSRI. It's been 2 weeks for me and while I haven't had as bad of side effects (I had loss of appetite and kept waking up early in the morning before falling back asleep which I didn't mind as much). I will say that I had a pretty bad depression, though whether it's just myself or from the medication, I'm not sure. I had no motivation and just wanted to sleep all day, which is definitely getting better. In terms of anxiety, I think that the medication helped a lot. Before I used to have anxiety/panic attacks every day and while I do get anxiety attacks sometimes, it's not as bad or frequent. I almost did have a panic attack at work but it lasted like a minute or 2 before it went away. The main thing is that it's stopped my brain from thinking these thoughts that just randomly pop up, or sometimes if there's a trigger it stops my brain from going further if that makes sense. Maybe it's just me but sometimes I feel like there's a physical wall in my brain that's preventing my anxiety from getting out of control. It's definitely prevented a lot of physical symptoms like heart palpitations and feeling like I can't breathe. I still feel tense and that tension, but it's much better.

So if you're taking one that's more long term, it's pretty common that you don't see the benefits for couple of weeks. However, you don't have to worry about being dependent on it. Hope it works out well for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I lived 22 years not knowing that anxiety was a thing and that it was not normal to worry excessively all the time. And then I started getting panic attacks and anxiety attacks. The first time that happened it freaked me out and I kind of accepted that it was much more than just stress. I accepted the fact that I had a disorder and now I’m working to learn to live with it.

On another note, I also have depression and I said something along the lines of “oh it’s just a depression thing” to my counselor. And then he said, “it’s not just a depression. Depression can kill.”

There’s a lot of stigma about how this is just a way of thinking that we can change but it’s a real problem just as broken bones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m seeing a counselor through my school’s counseling center and we’ve been meeting online for 2 months. There’s a specific HIPAA compliant program that they use so you could ask about that if you’re concerned with privacy. I just schedule a time when my mom is at work so that I don’t have to worry about her overhearing. I agree that it’s not as effective as in person, and there’s some stuff I would rather talk about in person. But overall it hasn’t impacted the sessions too much, although there can be some distractions. The thing that I like is that he’s more flexible schedule wise so if I’m having a really rough time I can meet with him the same day or the next day. Although I think that telehealth isn’t as good compared to in person, I still think that it’s better than not doing therapy at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I went to therapy for anxiety symptoms related to school but didn’t know I had anxiety until my counselor told me. The first session is mostly the therapist getting to know you. There probably will be a lot of questions like what you’re going through and your background. I think during my first session I learned coping skills for anxiety attacks and mindfulness. It made me feel free that there was an explanation to why I was feeling all these things but also a lot of questions because I didn’t really know too much about anxiety.

Therapy takes a long time and some sessions may be harder especially if you have painful memories from the past that might contribute to your anxiety but part of the process is to recognize it. After 2 months I feel like it’s helped a lot but sometimes also made it really hard. But overall it has helped me understand myself more and dealing with anxiety </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say covid just exposed the things that were already there. Like pharmacists not being considered healthcare workers. I don't remember who it was but some politician from New York initially didn't include pharmacists with healthcare workers until there was angry letters that made him correct his statement. And some restaurants not giving discount/free food to pharmacists because they weren't included as health care workers. Another thing is that corporations didn't provide adequate PPE, especially in the beginning where they were given surgical masks and were supposed to reuse them for a week. There's just a lot of things about how they're still encouraging people to shop for unnecessary things by still giving out coupons, not giving hazard pay (cvs did give a bonus but that was heavily taxed so people aren't too happy about that) and making stores covid testing sites and cutting hours. And then COVID just emphasizing how stupid people can be. Retail pharmacy was a horrible environment to begin with, covid just emphasized them all. </TEXT>

It got worse after coming home due to the lockdown and he was asking about my relationship with my mom. That was the first time I really recognized that it was child abuse. I'm sure she loved me, as it is with a lot of Asian parents, but I do realize now that there is chastising your kids and straight up child abuse. It's still painful to think about it and sometimes guilty talking about it but it's definitely liberating in recognizing that a lot of this is the reason why I'm the way I am and not because I'm a bad person. </TEXT>

I woke up around 5:30 and then had to wake up at 7 to register for classes. And then I just slept all day probably because I didn't get that much sleep. I definitely noticed lack of appetite but that was the only new thing I felt. Yesterday I got really depressed, didn't feel like doing anything, just took naps even though I wasn't tired, scrolled through facebook and stared at a wall all day.

<TEXT> I probably had anxiety most of my life but just got diagnosed with it a month ago when I went to see a school counselor after I was really stressed out about exams and stuff. At first I was hesitant about getting help at all because I didn't think it was a big deal but I found that it helped me get through rest of the semester. He asked me if I was on antidepressants and I said no, I didn't really like taking medications if I could help it. I guess it gave me a sense that there was something truly wrong that couldn't be fixed by just talking about it with someone. The past month it got worse every day until I had panic/anxiety attacks almost every day. I finally decided to take medication for it and I started on it few days ago.

My school is pretty small so we don't have a student health center so my counselor referred me to just a general practitioner at a college nearby. I met with her online for about 30 min and she asked stuff like what I was experiencing, just stuff about my anxiety. She prescribed me sertraline and so far I've experienced loss of appetite, insomnia and lack of energy. It's better than what I've heard from others and honestly I won't know if it's for me until at least a few weeks in but I'm going to see how it goes. I'm in pharmacy school so I'm always looking up drug information and stuff like that. You should always let your doctor know and check that you can take your other meds with the antidepressant but as far as I know, there isn't major interaction with birth control and commonly used antidepressants. But again, check with your doctor/pharmacist.

Antidepressants work different for everyone, so for one person, sertraline might work perfectly but another person would react badly to it. So it requires a lot of trial and error. Just because the first drug doesn't work for you doesn't mean that no other drug will, and it might be that you need more than one drug. You could try figuring out something with the doctor, but there might not be a set time frame like 6 months. A lot of antidepressants show efficacy around 4-6 weeks, maybe less for some. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My mom is the same but I did go to a college where freshman were supposed to live on campus (although we moved apartment to about 15 min from my school) and then after that I found excuses to stay on campus, like having morning practices for athletics, my brother being home so I couldn't focus on school. I was supposed to commute for next year, but I told my mom how much I couldn't focus on school during the quarantine and she agreed to let me stay on campus. I also saved up some money working and offered to pay for it too. But living on my own really helped me see how toxic my home was and how much freedom I have. Ever since coming home due to the quarantine, I haven't been able to relax, mostly due to trying to deal with anxiety. When I graduate my mom wants to live with me wherever I go, and I've learned that I need to learn to live on my own mostly because I need to learn how to be an adult and manage my own finances and my life. I'm dreading the day I'm going to tell her I'm moving out after graduation because like your mom, my mom is going to try and guilt me about saving money and taking care of her and all that.

<TEXT> Long story short, growing up in an Asian family I had a pretty abusive childhood which I just realized recently. Ever since coming home from school I've felt suffocated and just this past week I've had anxiety/panic attack every day. Talking about work schedule or school stuff with my mom triggers my anxiety and she doesn't even understand. If it's not my mom, it's my brother, who even though is 4 years older than me, but is really immature and constantly tries to annoy me. I've lost the drive to do well in school, and nothing really makes me happy. It just feels like I'm living life because I have to and because time goes on. I wanted to be a pharmacist, but now I just don't care. I think about how much I want to leave home, leave my family but I can't. Wherever I go, my mom will follow me because we don't have a permanent house and she probably won't leave me until she retires and goes back to our home country, which could be years. Every day I try to get by pretending nothing's wrong and slowly trying to heal from all the abusive memories that I keep remembering but she does or says something that just makes me angry and triggers my anxiety and starts the cycle of bad thoughts. I'm worried that we might not be able to go back to school in the fall, and more afraid that I'll never be able to live by myself in peace. This past month has been really rough with finding out that I had anxiety problems  and I can't imagine living like this for years. I don't know how to deal with these feelings or what I'm going to do with myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't say for sure how things generally in my home country because I haven't lived there since 2007 other than visiting for a month or two. From what I hear, it's pretty what it used to be, a lot of emphasis on studying, and kids committing suicide because of the stress of studying. It could be how parents were raised. My mom had pretty lax parents, but did really well in school by her own accord. She's really controlling to us, so I'm guessing she's trying to make up for the lack of "care" she received as a child. My friend has controlling parents too and still are. Her boyfriend's parents were strict when he was younger, but more lax now that he's an adult. I'm hoping that all the kids who were abused in childhood are breaking the cycle and trying to be good parents, which could be the case. But I would be interested in a study that looks at the trends and see if it's actually evolving. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is basically what I sent last year before my IPPE.

Hello Dr. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and I will be doing my IPPE community rotation at your pharmacy XX/XX/XX - XX/XX/XX. I wanted to email you ahead of time to see if there were anything specific you needed, such as dress code, intern license, parking, scheduling or anything miscellaneous.

I look forward to meeting you!

Best,

&#x200B;

As far as how rotation goes, I spent the first  2 weeks learning about the computer system, the layout of the pharmacy, did some filling, inputting prescriptions, phone calls, some OTC consults and a lot of vaccination because my preceptor was out until the last week of my rotation so I was just basically filling my time there (I already work in retail). And then I got to do some more interesting stuff like control inventory, BOP inspection checklist, verification, and learned about some MTM (we also had school faculty who actually works as MTM pharmacist in an office right next to the pharmacy) and did more vaccines and blood pressure at a living facility.  It was really weird because the other pharmacists didn't know what to do with me so they just gave me random things to do and made me leave early for the 2 weeks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not the only one, it's a really hard adjustment to make especially with the added stress of having a pandemic and whatever else you may have going on at home. I found out I had anxiety issues right before we went into quarantine back in March and I thought it would get better because it was triggered by just having so many exams back to back in one week. Fast forward to a month later I have anxiety attacks daily for no apparent reason, had some very dark moments and just don't care anymore (I'm an overachiever). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I understand that feeling. I think a lot of us who used college as a way to get freedom are feeling suffocated right now. My mom yelled at me because I was talking to my friend because we were working on homework together, even though that was the first time skyping her and actually talking instead of messaging each other. I was at a bad mental state at the time because I just found out right before the quarantine happened that I had an anxiety issue from childhood abuse and she was the only person keeping me alive. This was also the first time I realized I was abused as a child so I was reliving all these memories.

My therapist told me to breathe slowly and deeply if you're having irrational thoughts and having anxiety attacks. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't but hopefully it clears your head and focus on the now.

I try to distract from these thoughts by actually studying. It's hard to focus on studying when those thoughts try to invade, but I think about how much I need to get this assignment done and usually having that deadline makes it easier to forget. If not, I try to lose myself in my computer, just watch Netflix, social media, whatever helps.

And know that it's only for a few months. This is not going to last forever. I'm looking forward to going back to school in the fall, and if it is later than normal fall semester, then so be it. Point is, there will be a time that you can escape. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I live in US but our permanent home is in Korea and my dad is still there. He moved apartments few years ago and basically threw everything away. Sure, some things I didn't need anymore but I always look at those things and reminisce every time I go to visit. Now all I have are my bed, a piano, few pictures, trophies, clothes and few books that I don't even try to read because they're too complicated for my Korean skills.

On the other hand, I had a stuffed tiger that I had since I was like 1 or 2, a gift from one of my uncles/aunts and tiger is my favorite animal. My mom threw it away when we were moving from Canada -> US and I still miss it. My friend knows my obsession about tigers and bought me a couple but they don't really make up for that loss.

Honestly I'm sad, but I have to keep telling myself there's nothing I can do about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you currently in undergrad or in high school? I don't know if this will work or something you want to do but you could choose STEM major (if that's your thing) for undergrad but go a different path if you're wanting to go to grad school afterwards. During school, you could maybe figure out a way to be more independent so that you don't have to rely on your parents for financial support later. Or maybe take a year or 2 to do some premed classes and explain to your parents that you tried but it just wasn't for you (this is what my brother did. My parents pushed him to medical but he hated memorizing things so he eventually persuaded my parents to let him switch to math major instead). I understand that feeling, I sometimes wonder if I chose pharmacy because subconsciously I didn't want to go against my mom so I "persuaded" myself that that's what I wanted to do.

But at the end of the day, it's your life. Right now it may be about your parents but they're not the ones having to do that job for rest of the life. Going to school in any medical related profession is stressful, you have to memorize so many things, that if you truly don't want to do it, you might be miserable. It's better to realize that you don't want to go into it now than to forcibly do it and drop out later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hmm...I don't know how compounding would transfer over to cosmetics but it may be something relevant. At Walgreens I've seen some technicians compound, but not at CVS and it's not very often. It also may be state specific too. All the compounding I've done is reconstituting antibiotics (basically you put water in the bottle in 2 parts and you shake it) but there are some more complicated ones where you grind up tablets or need to mix multiple things (which may or may not be done by techs, I'm not sure). In terms of sterile compounding in hospitals, a lot of it is using a syringe to add something in an IV bag, which I don't think would be something relevant to cosmetics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it is better, but also depends on what you want to do. You'll probably spend most of your time ringing out people. But you also learn a lot about pharmacy and health care. You'll spend a lot of time inputting prescriptions into the computer or filling prescriptions, but you'll also learn how to deal with insurance issues, and definitely more about drugs (mostly what each drug is for, but you can pick up some random bits of information here and there). There's a lot of answering/making phone calls. There's some stuff you won't have to deal with that cashiers do (although depending on where you work, you'll still have to deal with couponers), but you get a lot of people arguing about copays, insurance issues, prescriptions that doctors never sent in etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just being there for her and talking to her (letting her open up to you) will help a lot. Before I was able to escape to college, I hated my family and just wanted to separate myself from them. I loved my mom but there was a lot of abuse and basically just hated my brother. I think that my mom basically ruined me and my brother's relationship by always comparing us and making it all about competition. I started seeing a counselor recently and he asked me if I could talk to my brother and try to get through it together, but there's no way that would happen. The only person I trust with my life other than my therapist is my friend at college. She's like the sibling I never had, someone I can relate to (because she had a toxic family too) and talk about all these things. I think that growing up in that family was so much worse because I didn't have anyone I could talk to. I kept everything inside until now that I have anxiety. Until you can move out and take her with you, one of the best things you can probably do right now is being there for her and someone she can trust. </TEXT>

The pharmacist actually turned out to be a professor at my school, so it was a great time. But basically the shift was at 9 but I didn't see the text until 11, so got there around 12 and find that she was the only one working and just so behind (this store was very behind to begin with). None of us knew where things were, I was just months into working and the she was just a weekend floater (full time prof ), so I got lost a lot of times, but the fact that I got to work with her (and couple of times after that) was great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I see it as both good and bad thing. When my mom gave me food after we fought, it made everything better. But when I think about it, she used the silent treatment as a punishment which was traumatizing, and basic need, such as food was used as a "reward." I guess it took so little to make me feel better, that I didn't know anything was wrong. But in 21 years of my life, I've had low self-esteem, perfectionism, social anxiety, all the symptoms of abuse. All the things I hated about myself was because of the way I was brought up. I see it as a short term solution to avoid conflict, but after recognizing that it's not what normal parenting is like, it's really hard trying to accept it and move on with my life. </TEXT>

I don't imagine talking about it with my mom anytime soon (if I ever) and I don't even tell her I'm doing therapy. It's so bad right now I feel like I need to be medicated but mental health issue is generally not well accepted in Asian culture and I'm just trying to find a way to do it without my mom finding out but it seems like I'll have to wait until I go back to school. Unfortunately we don't have a permanent home here so my mom will come wherever I go and I feel really guilty if I think about leaving her. But at the same time I don't know how long I can take this, or if I'll even be able to get through the summer without snapping. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know that feeling. Ever since the quarantine started, my mental state has been a huge mess. I found out a month ago that I had anxiety issues and started seeing a counselor then. Being at home all the time made me feel trapped with my family and like our professors didn't care. I feel like I'm reaching a new low every day and I'm just surprised at how I managed to come this far. I've had some dark thoughts, feeling empty, and my productivity level is at max 5-10% of what it used to be. I guess the only thing that is keeping me going is my counselor and my friends, and even sometimes that's not enough. I guess I keep going because I can't die. Do you know if your school offers online counseling? Or someone else you can see over the phone or computer until at least this is over? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not exactly a gf/bf issue, but with my best friend when we first became friends (actually still bothers me after years). We live together on campus, and she goes home for the summer and usually we just talk through texts. I get paranoid if I don't hear from her for a day or 2 that she's angry or annoyed at me. I always worry that I said something wrong or inappropriate and that's why she's not responding to me. It really cleared things up when I just told her that I thought she was angry at me when she left me on read didn't say anything, and she told me that she was just really tired after work and fell asleep. Did it help clear up my anxiety? No, I still worry sometimes, but at least I know that I shouldn't automatically jump to conclusions. I don't know if talking to her is something you want to do, but it will definitely clear up answers for you. If you're not comfortable talking about it with her, maybe try to set boundaries with her. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Struggling with memories of abuse </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-04-16 20:36:42 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi everyone I just discovered this subreddit last night and I found it so relatable.

So long story short, about a month ago, I had issues with school and was stressed out by a week full of exams back to back every day and started seeing a counselor on campus. I talked with my friend and she told me what I was experiencing was anxiety, which was news to me because I always dismissed it as being just stressed out, but it does seem right. At first my counselor and I talked about school stuff, just issues trying to be perfect and good grades. And then he was trying to understand my relationship with my mom so I talked about times she would beat me and emotionally abuse me (this was actually when I realized that it's not normal corporal punishment and was actually an abuse). I guess my brain was trying to block all these memories because I couldn't remember anything, few vivid memories, and how my mom was to my brother, but not my experiences. He told me to think about it for our next session so I've been thinking about it. I see the memories coming back, from wanting to die and my mom almost killing me, death threats, all kinds of stuff and it's painful. I couldn't sleep until 3:30 last night just thinking about it. I have an exam tomorrow and I can't stop thinking about it. I love my mom, but there are definitely  issues in our relationship, a lot of it is language barrier because we left my home country when I was very young and she doesn't speak English as well. I guess most of it is emotional barrier too because I have a lot of pent up feelings and just lash out at her whenever I get frustrated. When the quarantine started and I came home, it was bearable. But now I'm trying to act normal and nothing's wrong but remembering all these things is taking an emotional toll on me and my mom has no idea. I'm hearing that we might need to social distance for at least 2021-2022 and I'm scared that I won't be able to go back to school and escape.

Has anyone else had any issues trying to get over the past and being able to live with family like nothing's happened?

Thanks for reading a long post. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1 - yes, I actually didn't realize I had issues with anxiety and panic attacks until I talked to my friend about it. And talking to a counselor really helped me understand that that was my issue, and not just being overly stressed, because I always dismissed it as being stressed out.

2- yes, this was actually before I realized I had anxiety so I don't know it was because of that, but stress will make you feel pain even though there's nothing wrong physically.

3 - yes, when I had exams back to back for a week it would just keep on coming back

4 - honestly, I don't know. Talking to a counselor helps a lot. He told me to breathe deeply which seem to help sometimes, but sometimes it doesn't. I try to just get through the moment. Listen to music, cry, whatever seems to help distract myself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even if you start off really motivated and passionate about pharmacy, it's pretty easy to lose focus with the stress of school and work. Some of my classmates who are in it for the money are miserable right now. So if you're just in it for the money, it's probably not the best job for you. Even after knowing the fact that hours are being cut and wages aren't as high as it was before and you still want to go into pharmacy, it's not a bad job. I've seen people start off in retail and get an inpatient job and some people going from hospital to retail. Some people thrive in retail, some people hate it. Sure it sucks and you could be in a better place but also in a worse place. If you are going to choose pharmacy, do it  but be prepared to work hard for 3-4 years and with the possibility of working in retail. And get a job as soon as you can in school. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's a lot of things that they do that just increases healthcare costs instead of saving money for the patients. They  negotiate with the drug manufacturers who  makes all the medicines to get a "discount for the people" which I'm sure they do, to a certain extent. In return, the PBM's get what's called rebates, which is money paid by the manufacturers to the PBM for having their medicine on the PBM's formulary, which is a list of medicine that is covered by the insurance. But the PBM's try to get the patients to use expensive brand name medications instead of cheap generic because they get higher rebates, and more cash for the PBM.

Long story short, PBM gets more money from the manufacturer for making people get more expensive medication when a cheaper generic would work fine.

There's a lot of things that the PBM's do that's all kept hidden from public knowledge which makes them in a perfect position to scam people and get away with it. </TEXT>

A man came to the pharmacy looking for some masks. P = pharmacist, M = man

M: Do you have any masks?

P: Sorry we're all out

M: But you're wearing one

P: This is for the employees. We don't have enough that we only get 2 per week so we have to reuse them.

M: But you have masks. Can't you just give me some?

P: I'm sorry, we can't. We don't have enough for the employees.

M: Well, \[3-letter\] cares more about its employees than customers

&#x200B;

I wish this was true and they did care more about us. But at the same time, do I come to your work and demand free things because I'm the customer? We're here, interacting with hundreds of people and you want to take the very few that we already have? Just stay home like the stay-home order and you won't even need it </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say no. There's a lot of math involved in pharmacy calculations, but it's pretty basic math like converting units or figuring out proportions. I'm in my second year but I as far as I know, there's no course that require calculus level math, like integration or derivatives. All the math we've had to do is plug in numbers into an equation for therapeutics classes. It may help you understand some concepts in biopharmaceutics and where the equations come from, but as far as being able to know how to integrate, you won't need in pharmacy school. If you have a solid understanding of calculus already, you probably won't need to retake it. We only had 1 calculus and 1 statistics class in undergrad, so depending on what core classes you need to take to get the bachelor's degree, you may want to. </TEXT>

Fast forward 4 years, would it have made any difference in pharmacy school if I decided to take the classes again? Probably not, I barely remember anything from undergrad. I don't know how crucial these subjects are in PCAT because I never took it but if you're planning to take the exam, it might do you some good to solidify your understanding. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say yes. I skipped sophomore year (took some freshman classes and sophomore classes during my first year) and I would say the best thing about it is going to school 1 year less and having to pay less tuition. Even if you don't decide to accelerate a year, you definitely have less course load so it could make transitioning to college easier. It's kind of hard at first if you're taking sophomore classes because you don't know anyone and for me adjusting to anatomy and physiology during my first year was definitely harder. But I met some great people in the class I am in right now and like it much more because we have more sense of teamwork </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally don't like it even though I hated sitting in lectures. It's nice being able to wake up whenever and not having to leave my house but I miss going to class and seeing people in person. Time management is definitely harder and classwork that should take 3 hours takes double the time but our professors are making it as best as they can given the circumstances. They're more lenient about pushing back deadlines even though exams are a pain. I like the fact that we still have access to student services like counseling and tutoring even though I prefer being there in person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm actually in an opposite situation - Korean in America. I have insurance from school but my mom doesn't. Back when the US just started taking it seriously, I thought that it would be better to go back before flights cancelled, even though it was still rampant over there. Even if it meant higher risk of catching it, I thought it would be better to be in a place where there was testing widely available and cheap healthcare (because my dad still works over there). Now that it started spreading here, I'm afraid of catching it because there's not much of what we can do other than stay home until it gets really bad. And working in health care and watching things unfold, it's crazy how much scarier hysteria can be than the disease itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT> About a week ago, I would have said I'm fine working retail. When I went to work on Monday, it was coronavirus frenzy + monday night + floater. Drive thru register scanner broke, lane 2 tube broke and it got so bad to the point that I was angry that the printer ran out of paper and just little things. About 10 minutes past the time I was supposed to leave I got so frustrated with this lady's problems that I just had to leave. I had a really bad time with school the week before that I couldn't mentally handle being there. Now I'm dreading going to work even though I only work one day a week. I'm worried about snapping one day  and seriously questioning my life choices. Not to mention they just bought out this grocery store pharmacy chain recently in the midwest so I can only imagine that things will get worse as our store absorbs all the extra customers from across the street. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just as a background, I'm a pharmacy student. I started having issues couple of days ago. Last week was really bad and stressful at school. Exam, final, presentations, practicum, quizzes...pretty much every day for the entire week. On Friday, last day of everything, I finally broke down. I went to talk to one of the staff because I was pretty close to them and ended up crying. Saturday I went to work and I got through it. On Monday I went to work and I could feel myself breaking down again. I work in retail pharmacy, and with the coronavirus people are freaking out and coming to pick up their prescriptions, not to mention we had a floater pharmacist  (they tend to care less so they won't help as much at the registers) and it being Monday night, it got really stressful and I was on the verge of exploding by the time I was off. I used to think that I was just stressed out and didn't realize I might have an issue with anxiety until my friend told me. And now I don't have the energy to do anything, it takes me a long time to actually get out of bed and actually go to class or to other obligations like meetings and on campus job. I have an assignment due tomorrow and I can't focus enough to actually read through pages of article. I just don't have the patience and having to read this makes me angry. I made an appointment with the counselor but I'm worried about how I'll get through this week before I actually meet with them. The more time goes by I realize how bad it's gotten and don't know how to get out of this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work in retail pharmacy and it's really sad that some people have to pay hundreds of dollars for insulin, which they'll have to pay for rest of their lives and some people having to pay 400-500 to meet the deductible on Medicare. We have to find discount cards for people who really shouldn't need them when they are already paying premiums for their insurance, and we can't even look them up for Medicare patients. Not to mention there is a huge catch with discount cards... I was reading an article about economics in health care for a class and it talked about how we have all these expensive and new technology but we can't save lives because a lot of providers don't work together to provide a holistic care. </TEXT>

Doesn't mean that people should be going around everywhere with the flu, but just the whole quarantine and the precautions lead to more time lost. Of course, if it's someone who doesn't usually get flu shots bitches about it, I've got nothing to say to them. Being an Asian, I'm worried about racism than actual mortality but since my mom doesn't have insurance she's worried about health care bills.

<TEXT> I got a flu shot at my pharmacy, first time getting something at a pharmacy since I never had to take any medications except those I get from urgent care. I usually get shots from a hospital they do for free for the public so this was the first time, just to help with metrics. The first 3 times I got a text asking me if I wanted 90 days supply. I checked the insurance and it doesn't seem like they cover 90 days, so I went into my profile and declined 90 days. One month later, I get 3 more texts saying if I want 90 days. I hate it when people complain about calls and texts. But these corporates are really persistent to the point I'm annoyed at them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really baffled me when I started working in a pharmacy in the US. In S. Korea, there's literally 7-10 pharmacies just on one street (and the most I've seen is 3 just in one intersection here). I don't know the exact process but there are no refills. You get however many medicine the doctor prescribed you for and go back for a new prescription (medical care and cost of living is cheaper so less financial burden for a doctor's visit). It comes in unit packaging with different medications in one package and just an indication on the bag when to take it and how many times per day. There's no chain so you could literally go to any pharmacy, probably without a wait unless it's right next to a big hospital. The environment is so relaxed there since the pharmacists are the owners of the pharmacies. There's even TV to keep themselves entertained. Although I would imagine some of them wouldn't be able to make much profit with so many pharmacies around. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would keep it if I could. Talk to your manager (if you’re staying in the area) or the store you might transfer to and ask if it’s ok if you work like a 5 hour shift per week or if you can work once every 2 weeks, something that might me manageable for you. I did about 15 hours my first year but that depends on how difficult your program is and how you manage your time. But there were a lot of other students who were part time techs who worked one shift every 2 weeks so depending on the manager it might be possible. It’s hard to say 4 years from now, I would assume that it would be harder to get a job in general, and if you were willing to stay with the company I would think you have a better chance then applying as an external candidate. Definitely get a feel for the course load before you decide to quit. </TEXT>

This was before I truly understood what being a pharmacist was about (that was very stupid of me, I know). Fast forward to working 1 year in retail (what people considers the worst company to work for), I actually like it. I do well in high paced environment. What I really like is being one of the most accessible healthcare professionals and moments when I help someone and they're grateful. There are shitty people but honestly, whatever job I go into, there will always be those kinds of people, customer or coworkers. So far, my goal is to be a community pharmacist, but who knows? I might end up liking hospital pharmacy during my rotations. At the end of the day, even if I become a retail pharmacist, I wouldn't hate my life. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who works in a pharmacy, there are plenty of sets of eyes to make sure it's the right drug. The tech scans the barcode of the drug, making sure that it's the correct one in the system. The pharmacist then checks again to make sure it's the right one and that there are no issues with the patient getting it. As an intern, when I give the shot, I always ask the patient if they're getting the flu shot and check to make sure it is a flu vaccine. If you're going to check, don't be an asshole about it because guess what, we have to deal with hundreds of people giving us grief and complaining about every single thing on a daily basis while trying to get our job done.

And it's not just the simple matter of it being labeled "flu vaccine." Can you tell the difference between Afluria, Fluzone, high dose vs. regular dose or Fluad? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Try to get some hours at a different store where you can learn things that you can’t at your store. At the same time, you should be asking your pharmacist to teach you how to do drop off. I never did OJT with a trainer, I just learned by trying to do things and asking people how to do it.

I’ll try to explain it as simple as possible. You go to profile and then space bar for new Rx. In line 1 search by 3 letters of drug name, strength (or just name without strength).
When you put it in, it’ll change to generic automatically. If you want to keep it at brand, you kind of need to mess around with the daw in additional info (if doctor indicated daw 0). At this point, just ask the pharmacist because it gets more complicated and I’m still trying to figure it out.

Line 2 is DAW, usually it’s 0 for substitution permitted but doctors may indicate brand only which is 1 I believe.

Line 3 is if it is paper rx, fax or phone, pretty self explanatory.

And then sig code is the directions. There are short cuts like PO for by mouth or BID for 2 times daily but you can type everything out. If you do sig codes, you have to separate each by semicolon so 1T;PO;BID.

Quantity prescribed and refills are self explanatory, dispensed quantity is usually same as prescribed but if someone wants 5 tablets instead of 30 prescribed, that’s where you would 5.

Prescriber search by first 3 letter of first, last, 2 letter state code. Or you could do N+npi number or dea number.

Third party: if there’s no insurance on file, go to F4, search bin and then match the pcn and name of insurance. This part is tricky and it takes practice to get good at it. And then it’ll ask for ID number, group, and everything else. For person code, cardholders are 01, spouse is 02 and then children are 03, 04 in the order from top to bottom.

Number in order: I usually put in 1 for everything, I don’t know if it actually makes a difference.

Promised time: 1h for 1 hour, 8a for 8 am or w15 for waiting

You can put it on hold by doing h or F3 + IS to see if you have it in stock if someone wants to know if you have it before you type everything in. After you scan it press F12 to see if it goes through insurance or not. If it doesn’t, you have to go to ‘QT which is whole another beast.
You might need to play around it for a while and look at all the options for each section because there’s so many different situations you can get. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m an intern but it’s just some things I’ve heard during annual review and conversation with my pharmacist. For someone just starting in retail, it’s important to understand that you have to know how to do tech work and not feel that it is beneath your position (also true for some floater pharmacists). It may be true that they’ll do less pick up as pharmacists but there’s no better way to learn patient interaction and dealing with different situations than to actually face them at the register. That will also be the place where they will get some counsel question that they might be able to answer. My manager is big on customer service so he likes that I drop everything to help someone at register. Community pharmacy is about the patient at the end of the day so instead of being task focused, it should be patient focused. I think that being flexible is important because there will be days where you’re stuck at the register the entire shift. There will be days where you’ll do compounds, counsel people or give immunizations. My priority is to help with the workflow. I can’t expect the pharmacist to teach me anything when there are hundreds of scripts to fill and phone calls to be answered. My manager wants his interns to be “super techs” good at tech duties but also with more responsibilities of a pharmacist and higher expectations because there will be times you won’t have any techs as a pharmacist so you need to know how to do everything. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Favorite: the people I work with. From when I started a year ago, we lost 6 techs but the 3 that are still with me are awesome. Our pharmacy manager is a great guy and all the staff pharmacists are great.

Least favorite: People getting angry over insurance issues, copays and calls, thinking that it’s the pharmacist’s job to make sure they get their texts, people who smoke in drive thru, horrible floaters and pcq calls

Craziest thing: I’m lucky enough to not have seen anything really crazy other than people going ballistics over little things. I’ve heard stories about people overdosing in the aisles, night pharmacist getting robbed and someone getting drunk on the job and getting fired but as a part time person not much happen on my shifts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We had a guy wanting a refill on his suboxone today, but it was too early to refill. He was freaking out saying that he was completely out and needed his medication. I don't know what the reason was for being out so early since the pharmacist was helping him and I was helping other people. But he did keep cutting in front of people to say that he needed his medication and then insisting that he needed to go, but also refusing to leave without the med. So the pharmacist called the insurance company, waited for a long time and after a long conversation with them, still got a reject. She told him she wasn't going to give up on it and she will try to figure it out so he should just go and she'll give him a call later. He was still insisting that he needed it and refusing to leave. It was about an hour later of being on call with the insurance and trying to figure it out with our pharmacy manager through text until he left.

So for this whole hour, I spent the entire time helping people because everyone came in to get their meds before the snowstorm that we're supposed to have. I maybe filled 1 or 2 waiters, but it was drive thru, pick up, drive thru, phone calls. It was like the day before Thanksgiving except we had 3 techs that day and it was only me and the pharmacist today. It was even worse because we had 2 full time techs quit and a recent grad pharmacist so we were in a bad state already. Thankfully the pharmacist was awesome and managed to verify waiters and helped deal with a phone call that I didn't know the answer to.

About an hour and a half - 2 hours later, she calls the guy back to say there's no way she can get that to go through the insurance. He says "Oh I'm not actually out, I just wanted you to fill that."

He saw how busy it was, there were phone calls that kept ringing and the pharmacist calling for help from the front but the front store too busy to help. He cut in front of other people and made a whole big deal that he won't leave without it. Thinking back on it, I sincerely hope she puts a note not to fill anything early for him because it goes beyond having a sense of entitlement, he was intentionally trying to deceive us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My PM wanted me to talk a little bit about myself and about my status in school (I was P1 in pharmacy school at the time). And then he told me right off the bat he was going to hire me. Interview took like maybe 5-10 min. Depending on how desperate they are for a tech, you'll probably get the job at the spot if there's no red flags, or maybe you'll hear back in a week or 2. And then it's more waiting game of fill out some paperwork, get drug test, do orientation/training and start working. Process took about a month for me.

At the store I interviewed before this, there was an intern about to graduate who had a long list of questions like how did you deal with conflict with customer service, about different activities I do at school, what I wanted to do after I graduate, my schedule, etc. This was in target so we did it at Starbucks inside the store and it was just really not the right place for an interview. I think I called a few days after as a follow up and they told me they hired someone else (which I'm glad I didn't get hired there because commute was twice as long) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hope it goes well for you! If it's a summer internship specifically, they typically start advertising in the fall so most would apply then, but most internship/job at hospitals are year round, same as being a technician just with a title of intern. I would say people apply typically close to breaks because that's when they start thinking about jobs and there's less school stuff to worry about. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know what exactly the position is, but a quick search shows me that it's something under ASHP. If you're going for ASHP residency (as opposed to clinical ACCP), I would say it counts as experience, but I don't know for sure. I guess the residency directors would know more about it, if you go to ASHP conference and talk to them face to face. Maybe if there's someone who knows a lot about residency at your school (like a student or faculty), you could ask them too. Have you had a job offer already for both or are you just considering applying for it? If you don't have an offer yet, I would go ahead and apply for both since you never know which one you're going to get. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pharmacy school is essentially a grad school, it's not just a traditional 4 year college. It is stressful (imagine trying to memorize dose, side effects, contraindications, chemistry and everything else behind drugs and learn to apply it to a case study). On top of that, if she has a job or trying to get ready to apply to residency that's more work that she has to do. This is just me, but my life revolves around school and work. All the "free time" I have, if I have any, is used to destress and get ready for more school stuff. I had to reject someone because I was that busy with school (and part of it was they were long-distance). There a lot of people who are able to maintain a relationship and that really depends on what kind of relationship they have. But I would understand if she was really concerned about school to maintain a relationship. Maybe it could be other factors too. Have a talk with her and see where she stands, if she's willing to get back after graduation or what kinds of expectations she has if she is willing to keep it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1.5 GPA won't get you into any decent schools...maybe new programs that haven't been accredited yet but you're probably better off not going to those places. It may be true that pharmacy schools are becoming easier to get into, but below a 2.0 doesn't seem likely. Although you may be able to attend community colleges (you probably need to take some required classes for admission anyway), which I don't believe refuse admission based on grade. Once you get all the required classes and a better GPA, you'll have a better chance.  I don't know what the process of immigration will be like, but you can start by looking into international admission to community colleges. Most of them will require TOEFL (English proficiency test). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Generally, no. The most you'll probably learn is what each drug is for, but not how they work or anything like that. Although if you tried really hard and listen to what the pharmacist tells the patients, you could pick up a few things. You'll hear stuff like side effects, if some drug should be taken in a particular way, or maybe what OTC to use in some situations. But if you really want to learn medical knowledge, retail pharmacy is definitely not the place. If you're looking for that kind of thing, I would recommend medical scribe (I've never done it myself but always wanted to because you get exposed to what doctors do in ERs) </TEXT>

<TEXT> It’s an entry level job, meaning you don’t need to have any medical experience and do pretty well. The modules are a lot when you first get hired, but it’s just something you have to grind through (we had someone quit over modules even before starting working). You don’t need any medical knowledge at all, the most people will ask is what a medicine is for, but you’ll pick that up as you work. That’s why pharmacists are there, so that they can answer all the medicine related questions and whatnot. It’s really similar to retail, probably majority of your job will be ringing people up, but they will get angry over other things like copay, or annoying phone calls and not having meds ready. If you choose to get certified you’ll get more medical knowledge. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, if you can handle it, that's awesome. 20 hours alone was just  hard for me. It was doable but I didn't enjoy it that much .I know couple of people who work hospital + community and are fine with it but they need more money than getting good grades so that's their choice. Another person I know had two jobs and quit the community because it was too much. The more diverse experience you can get, the better because it gives you more choices on what you want to do/don't want to do and gets you a foot in the door. You could try it and drop one that you like the least later on or do all three as long as you have enough time to study. </TEXT>

Yeah but from what I've heard, it's the same in other retails (though how much different I don't know). I've got great coworkers and pharmacists who make it worth it. On the other hand, there's a store that all the techs quit because the manager wasn't doing his job very well and it just got intolerable.

But  I agree that it's a lot of stress and work especially when we're understaffed. Flu shot clinics are great because it's all about flu shots. You don't have to worry about pick up, drive thru, production and drop off especially when flu shots take forever to enter because they have to be processed in different ways that differ for each insurance. Not to mention it takes the pharmacist away from the work flow so you have to wait for a forced counsel or whatever needs their attention.  It's my first flu season working in retail and I was just in shock at how busy it got when the flu season started. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that the spacing makes a huge difference. I haven't worked at a hospital, but got a tour of a hospital pharmacy when I was doing a job interview. There was a total divide between the pharmacists, who would sit at a desk most of the day and techs doing other things in a different room. In retail setting, we're all in the same space. There's not really divide and we can talk while we work. I have a hard time forming relationships with new people but I got accustomed to everyone and just talked comfortably about a month or 2 into the job. The first impression that I got at the hospital that the pharmacists were above the techs, whereas in retail I got a more family feeling where techs and pharmacists work together to get the job done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It made me cringe just reading about this. When you're off the clock and getting a medicine from the pharmacy, you're a patient. The same rules same as a non-employee apply. The fact that the pharmacist rang out the script can be considered insurance fraud since you didn't request it. It's not just the matter of doing things regardless of what you want as a patient, or even the company policy, it's the law. Honestly, I don't know the best place to bring this up, but if it's a staff rph, definitely talk to the pharmacy manager. You could talk to ethics and counsel, I've heard some conflicting things as to whether they are actually useful or not. You could definitely talk to the DL too if you know how to get a hold of them, though with some of them caring about the metrics more, whether they'll do something depends on the person. You could also try the board of pharmacy. This is just a big no no. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work at my school library and had a lady from the public come in to use our computers for a while (it's a college and we have public computers but we rarely get people from the public coming in to use them). Every day she came, she asked us for help and always give us a home address to send an email. She was trying to apply for a job, so she was trying but she asked us every time she came. She just didn't understand that you couldn't use a street address to send an email. Eventually one person got fed up and told her there was a public library nearby where someone could help her better and I haven't seen her since. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cringe at the amount of times I have to call the patients as part of "metrics." Like if there's an insurance issue, backorder or out of stock? I have no problem calling patients. But calling them  2-3 times/week for a refill or to sync up meds? I'm happier when I get the voicemail so I don't have to deal with people yelling at me to stop calling. I don't think it's completely wasteful and useless because there's a lot of people who would be in a mess if we didn't call them but a lot of times it's more trouble for us and for patients. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yup I don't know if you heard about this particular store where every tech quit but our manager's trying to schedule some of our techs over there. I'm a student so I work part time and I was relieved when we hired another tech so that I could get some break to study but it seems like I'm back to working about 20 hours. Some of my classmates work more than that all year so I shouldn't complain but it's hard when I'm trying to get caught up with school work. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I took a month long trip outside of the country right after I got hired. It took about a month to finish all the orientation and modules since I'm a student so I had to find time outside of school to come in and finish them. And then by the time I was done we were into winter break which I made plans for months in advance to buy plane tickets and stuff. My pharmacy manager was really cool about it. I guess it really depends on your manager but I did work a lot of hours after I came back and just before school started again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, this isn't a story and I don't even know what this is. Help? Advice? Just want to get it out? I really don't know.

I'm a P2 and just been feeling so hopeless not as much because of grades but because of work. This is the second time I just started crying because I didn't know what to do. The first was when I was scheduled for 4 days straight (thurs-sun) and then tuesday before a really big exam that I had no idea what was going on. I managed to get sunday and tuesday off because my staff pharmacist helped find someone to cover for me and I did pretty well on the exam. And then today was just a big mess. I work at school on fridays but I kept getting scheduled on friday so my friend always helped cover my shift at school. I told my manager but he really doesn't listen. (He really thought one day, on a school night was enough for me to study for that exam). My friend had something this friday so I asked everyone I know to cover my shift at school and then at the pharmacy. No one wants to help. Ok I understand that people have plans but honestly, it's been like this every time. I can never get anyone to cover my shift on a friday night. I've run out of people to ask. I asked my staff pharmacist but not my manager because I know he's going to get pissed that I'm not going to work that day even though I never call out without having a replacement for me. I have one more option as a last resort but I really don't want to do it. They have closed the library early before (I work at the school library) because I wasn't there but I hate making them do that. I'm already on a thin line because I only worked one shift this semester. And I really don't want to call off at the pharmacy because I know how crazy it gets when one person doesn't shows up.

Honestly at this point, it's beyond my jobs. I'll just ask them to close the library early and go to work at the pharmacy and get over it. No big deal right? But now I'm thinking why am I doing all this? It's not that I regret choosing pharmacy. I really respect pharmacists and what they do, but why am I going through all this for ungrateful people who gets bitchy that you're trying to help them or people who won't help you out when you really need them? I just want to end it all and say f\*\*\* it to both but I don't even have the courage to do that. I've always been a good kid getting good grades and helping out everyone but no one really cares when you fail or need help in return. There's just this hole of not knowing what to do, but I don't even know what I don't know. I don't even know what this feeling is. I can probably describe it best as hopeless but I don't even know if it is right. It's just a series of I don't know in my mind and yet here I am, worried about an exam I have coming up.

I am truly sorry if this post seems like a mess. Because it is a mess. My head is a mess and my feelings are a mess. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would honestly recommend them because of personal experience. When I was applying to be intern at cvs I waited a while but I didn't hear back after the online interview. I sent the email and a couple of days later, got a job offer. I have a friend who applied to same store over a month ago and she still hasn't heard back. Both times my store was desperate for someone. I think that I got the job because I sent that email.

But then I had another friend who sent a follow up email and didn't hear back at all. Found out she didn't get the job just because the online posting was taken off. It really depends on the person in charge of hiring, but I don't think it will hurt you in any way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a current pharmacy student and it wasn't a MD (it was a MD student) but I felt that it shows how little respect other professions (or students) have for pharmacists. Our school does interprofessional activity with the nursing/MD/OT/PT students at a nearby school where we examine cases and approach it as a healthcare team. This is a story I heard from someone else in our class. Our case had a patient with diabetes and we didn't cover diabetes yet, we just finished pulmonary stuff like COPD and asthma. And the other students were in their 3rd year and knew all about diabetes, so they asked the pharmacy student what they would do for the patient in managing her diabetes. She told them we didn't learn it yet and the MD student got all cocky and said, "The pharmacists at hospitals don't know anything anyway." Working in retail, I've seen so many mistakes that doctors have made and potentially could have harmed patients. Pharmacists save the MD's butts and a lot of them don't even realize it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You can, but you would have to check that the pharmacy school you are planning to go to, or any pharmacy school in general takes the credit. They usually look for science/math classes with some other ones that you would typically take in undergraduate. You could get a bachelors and then apply to pharmacy school (in which case you could leave and choose another field if you feel pharmacy school isn't for you), or apply as soon as you have the required credits. You would need to take the PCAT if you choose this route. You could also go into a direct entry program where you have 3 years of undergrad (starting as freshman) and then after an interview and a writing assessment, you enter the pharmacy program without taking the PCAT. There are pros and cons to this, if you know pharmacy is for you, it's a really pharmacy focused environment. At the same time, you can kind of get sucked into it so you might not realize that you don't want to be a pharmacist until too late. </TEXT>

But at the same time, it stops the bitching and it’s not like we’re losing anything, we take it out from their script when they get a new one. It annoys me because people don’t call ahead for a refill and come to the pharmacy when they run out especially on the weekend and bitch about it but if I can just get them out of there, I’ll take it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was the same way when I started, and to be honest, still feel the same way. I'm worried when I make a mistake and then my pharmacist or manager would hate me. It relieved some stress when I had my annual review and my manager gave me a good review, but I'm still wondering if they hate me for a mistake I made or making a customer mad. And sometimes it just gets busy that they forget/don't have time to teach you new things. If you want to learn something new, you have to ask them how to do certain things. I actually accidentally deleted a script instead of putting it on hold couple of days ago because someone told me you couldn't fully delete a script or everyone would be trying to cover up their mistakes by deleting scripts. Well I learned the hard way that yes, you can delete them. Anyway, it just comes with being a really stressful job. You're running around everywhere, doing multiple things at the same time, getting interrupted every time you start to count something. I had anxiety about taking calls because I couldn't figure out their name and DOB over the phone and just kept on asking them to repeat it and they would get frustrated. And when you just get started, you look around everywhere for drugs. Is it a fast mover? Slow mover? fridge? birth control? I've been intern for about a year now, and it truly does get better. I can take calls with no problem, still working on multitasking and doing things faster but I can do most things by myself. Do I still make small mistakes? Sure, too often than I would like but it's a learning process. If it helps, keep a small notebook and keep notes in it so that you can remember what each message is supposed to mean. And if you have the print screen function, that really helps. I would tell people I would something for them and then forget completely. There's a sticker on the label with their name/rx on it so I would just stick them on my hand and leave a note for myself or print screen the person's profile and write a note. Unfortunately it's not a good place for a new person to start at because there's really no time to learn things, you're put into it and left to figure it out and learn as you go. If you feel like it's impacting your studying and school stuff, you could get tested, but it is normal to feel that way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The amount of pages in QP really depends on the store. This is just my guess but 24/7 stores are better at it just because they’re open all night to catch up (please correct me if I’m wrong). Ours is 24/7 and the max I’ve seen is maybe 7-8 pages with about 2500 scripts/week. Another store that’s not a 24/7 that I covered sometimes had about 20 pages last time I was there. I’m sure target has their own issues with discounts and stuff but you’ll probably see more coupon issues. Drive thru is definitely a pain. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sure this has happened to a lot of people, or at least yelled at for a similar situation. The register froze (as they always do because they're from dinosaur era at cvs) so I turned it off and turned it back on and it takes forever to turn back on. I had a line of about 5-6 people, and our other register (we have total of 3) had been down for over a week so I couldn't use is.

OL (old lady): You know, thanks for turning the computer off and causing all these issues.

Me: Oh I'm sorry, it was frozen so I had to turn it off and turn it back on.

OL: I know. Thank you for that.

Me: (in my head) WTF?????

OL goes on and on about it and just doesn't let it go.

Me: I'm really sorry there's nothing -

OL cuts me off: I know. I understand.

Me: (eyeroll in my head and proceeds on ignoring her)

OL to my coworker: Hope you have a nice day. You know, with the computers not working and all.

At that point I opened the cash drawer rather aggressively when I was helping someone else (not on purpose but that's how I felt anyway).

At least my coworker offered to help this lady instead of me having to deal with her because if I had to, I probably would have flipped out. There's a level of rudeness I can tolerate. Insurance problems that I can't control? Sure I'll deal with it. Angry about the price? That's fine, we receive the blunt of all these issues anyway. But that just pissed me off so much like if I had the power to, I would have told her to leave and refuse to serve her. And it wasn't like there were any profanities, she wasn't swearing or anything. But the tone and the way she said it was so smug and like she was going out of her way to make my life miserable. The only thing that made me feel better was that my coworker agreed that she was really rude and she was like yeah whatever (she didn't actually said that) when the lady wished her a nice day.

I guess the next time she has an issue I shouldn't try to solve it because apparently you're supposed to leave it as is.

TL;DR lady gets angry that I try to fix a frozen computer </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had someone yesterday wanting a flu shot, she had anthem. For some reason, I couldn't get it to go through, and I tried everything like looking up a separate vaccine part, doing the additional info and putting in MA. We had a floater and she had no idea either. The patient stormed off saying she doesn't trust someone who can't even figure out insurance to stick a needle in her arm.

A. We get special training to be able to immunize. We don't get trained on doing insurance stuff.

B. I wish I could have told her to do it herself if she thinks it's just as easy as putting in a bunch of numbers and have it go through every time.

C. Giving an IM shot is actually simpler than doing insurance (at least in my opinion).

Anyway someone else who had anthem come in for a shot, it went through with no problem. </TEXT>

Now it seems across the board that raises are maybe 30-40 cents, give or take. I got a 40 cent raise in Midwest, I've seen 30 or 35 cents.

<TEXT> I think there was a similar post about touching tablets with hands and the majority, if not all, said that they would pick it up if it fell on the counter. If it fell on the floor, it would depend on the drug, but it would become a huge waste to throw away every pill that touched the counter or accidentally with the hand. And especially because retail pharmacy is a really rushed environment, we don't think twice about it. I know the drugs are supposed to be sent to strongpak for waste, but I've seen some get thrown away in the trash. The process to put it in the strongpak take longer time (for us we have to put the pill in a small plastic bag, print out the label for that particular drug NDC, and cut the label so that it fits on the ziplock bag). So when you have over 100-200 scripts to fill and you're a really busy pharmacy, it can be burdensome to go through the process, especially for every single pill. It is one of those things that should be followed, like counseling patients for every new medication but the environment of retail pharmacy and emphasis on efficiency/speed doesn't allow. I definitely try to put the ones that touch the floor in the strongpak, but it gets so swamped that I just collect them all in a vial instead of identifying each pill and doing the entire process. Some pharmacies may enforce it more, but I would be surprised if there was a place where every pill touched the hand/counter/floor were disposed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am sad to say there are still quite a lot of people in my class that are just in it for the money. What keeps me going is that there are still a lot of pharmacists in retail trying to make a change, which may not be a drastic change in the profession, but little ones that make the profession worth something to the public. Both my pharmacists are really great, they're always emphasizing patient care above everything else. The metrics sometimes are just so ridiculous but they push through it because some of them really help the patients. They're really trusted by the patients, and the only ones who complain are the ones who don't know them as well and only care about their meds. The profession may be going downhill but I believe that these are the people who fight to keep it going, who really do practice what a pharmacist was meant to be. And that's why I'm against scaring people away. Yes I want people to be informed and make the smartest choice for themselves. But at the same time, if you really were passionate about the profession, wouldn't you want the next generation of students to try to help make it better? It's like politics, regardless of what your beliefs are, if you think the country is screwed up, you try to fix it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's rare in a sense that there are just fewer independents compared to retails. You've got 3-4 major retail companies with stores all over the city/state whereas you would probably have 4-5 independents nearby (at least in my area). There's fewer students interning in independents because there are less positions available, not because it is inferior in any way. I know a couple of people who got hired as pharmacist at the independent after working as a student. People say independent is better in terms of work environment, but you certainly may be at a disadvantage just because there are so few independents compared to chains. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm not a tech, just an intern studying to be a pharmacist. There are technician schools that last about a year depending on the program, but they are not necessary. Most people don't recommend it, since it's a waste of money and you can get the same training by learning on the job. It is an entry level job at retail places such as CVS or Walgreens, and I believe they pay for the exams to get certified. So you could apply for a license, start working and that's how you become a technician. You can take the national exam through the PTCB to get certified, which just lets you do more things, get better pay in retail and have better chances of getting into hospitals.  In terms of responsibilities, it depends on the state, but technicians typically fill, ring out people, data entry, take verbals (I believe this is more of a company thing because at my work the pharmacist does majority of taking prescriptions over the phone but at my rotations the techs did the non control ones), inventory, that kind of stuff (although there are more roles in the hospital, such as making IV bags). The pharmacist does vaccines, counseling, verifying prescriptions, controls, doctor calls, insurance calls and such. The tech role is growing, I think some states are trying technician verification (you would have to be certified for this) so that the pharmacist can have a more clinical role and be able to help the patients more. I don't know the hospital is because I've only worked in retail, and as many people would describe it, it sometimes just feels like a cashier position. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a P2, I would say cardio but it gets harder every year. From what I've heard from the P3's, infectious disease is so much harder because with cardio, it's a lot of drugs you hear about if you work in a pharmacy but with infectious disease, you have anti-virals and other meds that you don't hear very often. Although if you wanted to study ahead, I would just review things that are relevant, like physiology (if you have had that course). I tried studying ahead over the summer but it's just not the same as learning in class. If you want to, you could get started with the top 300 drugs from mcgraw hill since you're going to need to know them anyway but there are a lot of things that you may not understand before taking the class. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I didn't think the flu was a big deal until I actually got it. I got the shot every year because my parents kept up with all my vaccines (thank god) but it was just a routine thing. I was so sick, not able to get up without feeling like I was about to pass out and just crawling to the bathroom because I felt like throwing up. I slept for hours in the day and coughing throughout the night. I also had asthma symptoms where I couldn't breathe if I tried to walk any faster or go up the stairs. Going through that really made me appreciate the flu vaccine and it just baffles me why parents are willing to put their kids in danger and make them suffer from the disease. Like any "flu" people claim to have which are just immune system's reaction from getting the shot are nothing compared to the disease itself.  And when I work at the pharmacy and people just laugh at me when I ask them if they want a flu shot... I don't even know what to say anymore. Some people just don't listen to reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I totally understand. I’m saying that right now because I don’t know what hospital pharmacy is like. It sounds interesting (like the clinical aspect), but I’ve yet to do my hospital IPPE in the summer and hoping that that will solidify whether I would like that position or not. Community residency sounded more interesting, since I would be out in the community but in a more different setting than a staff pharmacist in a chain. Sorry I wasn’t trying to sound as if I just wanted to do this for job security (I’d rather do something I want to do than be miserable doing a job that I hate), I’m still trying to figure out what my goals are and right now and  I just don’t know enough to say I’m not going that route. </TEXT>

Feel free to browse around the sub. Honestly I don't agree with the scare tactic, I think you should make your own decisions rather than being scared away from the field from what people on the Internet say. It all comes down to how much you are willing to sacrifice, how much you can afford and how much risk you are willing to take to become a pharmacist. But just delve more into what it really is like for retail pharmacists and some of the biggest issues. </TEXT>

Even if you know you're going to pharmacy no matter what, things might happen that could change your decision. I'm not saying you will, but there are a lot of people drop out after their first year or decide to go to med school/non health care route. If you want to have a back up that is a good plan. However, bachelors is not necessary for pharmacy school and if you want to finish school early/save money, you don't have to get that degree. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't worry too much about it just yet, you haven't even had your first exam. I had a lab that I got a 0 several times and I was freaking out about every time I had that lab but it turned out well because I put more effort into that particular class. I don't know what class you're struggling with but you may need to change up your studying style. I found that flashcards are really helpful in  memorizing drugs and especially because we have to focus on small details now instead of the big topics in undergrad. Look at the questions you got wrong and see why you got those wrong. Is it because you overlooked them when you were studying or you just didn't understand the topic? Try to find different ways to study that works for you and get help from your friends and professors. The biggest change that I struggled with and still struggle with a little bit is not having weeks between exams, but as I got used to it and changed the way I study, and now it's a lot better. You've still got a whole semester and those quizzes won't determine your grade. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A great way to learn on the job would be to get some hours at a slow pharmacy and learn the ropes. Other than that, the only way to really learn is to ask questions and watch what other people do. Don't feel like a burden, it's better to ask the first time and get it right than to try to do things yourself and mess it up. That being said, carry a small notebook to take notes on so that you can go back to it without bothering anyone else. Once you get the hang of the computer system, there's all the options at the bottom with the shortcuts so it's not too hard, except some stuff that doesn't seem obvious (like Active (A) for any patient outreach calls or that you have to View (V) to look at cost histories for refills). Here are some common ones to get you somewhat familiar with the system.

Once you search the patient, <spacebar> for a new prescription. The first one is drug, you can search by using the first couple of letters. if you do drug,strength, you can get it much faster. Like ATO,10 if you want to search atorvastatin 10 mg.

For DAW, you generally select 1 (if prescriber signs on the line that says substitution permitted). I think 0 is if they sign on the line with brand only (I could be wrong about the number, but it gives you a list of what each number is if you go to that field). Sometimes patient wants a brand, in which case it gets way more complicated and I don't remember it top of my head.

Other things like sig code, quantity, refills you get them off the prescription.

With prescriber search, you could use their DEA number (2 letters + 7 numbers, like BA1234567), NPI (10 digit number, in which case you would search by typing N + number), or 3 letters of first + last name, 2 letter state (like WA for washington). Again it gives you prompts that you can follow.

For number in order, I don't know if it matters, I was just told to always put 1 even if the patient brings in multiple scripts.

And finally promised time, W15 if waiting or 1h for 1 hour, 5p for 5pm.

Drop off is just something you have to practice and get used to.

Other features include Status (S) to check if there's anything in the waiting bin, anything scheduled for readyfill, anything picked up if it wasn't too long ago.   Edit (E) prescription if someone wants to use a discount card instead of insurance so you have to rebill. Go to line 11 (you can just type 11 to get to the field instead of pressing down) and search by PCN. I usually search by PCN and choose the correct BIN. Also sometimes you'll get people wanting a 30 day instead of 90 day. So if you go up to dispensed quantity (not the prescribed quantity), you can change to 30 (if 1 tablet daily).

There's just so many things that I can't list all of them here for you but if you have any questions you can message me or post it on the subreddit. Generally people are really great at telling you how to do certain things. But most of all, don't be afraid to ask questions. If possible, you can try to wait until it dies down (if it ever does) but people get that you're new and you might not know a lot of things. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't worry too much about being underqualified for CVS or Walgreens. I've started with no experience, most of the people I've worked with entered the field having no experience. As you work as a pharmacy tech, a good thing to do is get certified through the PTCB (it's like a national certifying exam). Taking classes are not necessary if you don't have the financial means for it. You can borrow books from the library or get a cheap one online and study. Once you get certified and build up experience, you'll be more desirable for hospital positions where most likely you will get a raise (my lead tech ended up staying in retail because the pay and benefits was better). Take the opportunities to learn and get certified in new skills like making IV bags and you'll find a lot of opportunities outside of just retail where you can earn more money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I actually never had on the job training where they set up a time to go over everything, I just learned things as I went. Honestly, it will depend on your store and the manager, like ours is a fairly busy store but my pharmacist always made time to teach me things, but I've heard stories where people didn't really learn anything at all. I started in November, about a month before finals. I did my orientation before finals, and then computer modules after finals. I actually left the country for about a month right after finishing the computer trainings before officially starting working, which they were fine with. It can be hard to make time for classes and stuff but if you can spare a couple of hours during the week, it shouldn't be a problem. I believe the requirements for interns were about 8-10 hours/week. I highly doubt they keep track of it though. My store actually doesn't have too many tech hours to give me so I'm working about 4 hours a week. I've heard of people working once every 2 or 3 weeks. The bare minimum is a shift per month to keep you from being kicked out of the system. As to how many hours you need to work will vary on your home store and manager. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would say most people I know work at a pharmacy. Those who don't are either looking for one, don't have a car or don't realize the importance of interning. I think that experience is way more important than grades because A) you meet a lot of pharmacists who can potentially give you a job after graduation, B) figure out where you want/don't want to go C) much more impressive on resume because it shows that you know what you're doing. Even if you want to get into residency, it's still really important to get experience. Sure good grades are good but I would say you're more likely to get in with experience than just good grades. Even if it's just one day a week for 4 hours, it's so much better than doing none. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let's just say it's not the best time to go into pharmacy. Go through the subreddit and take a look at all the posts regarding hour and wages cuts if you haven't already. I stand by my position that if you truly believe that it's for you and there's nothing else you want to do, you should go for it. If you can financially afford it, then go ahead. I'm not going to bash on pharmacy like a lot of people because there wasn't anything else I wanted to do other than pharmacy. I honestly couldn't see myself as a doctor or nurse, and none of the other fields appealed to me. It's terrible that there are just so many flaws within the health care system but it is my decision and I'll face the consequences. If I had any advice though, it would be get some tech experience in a pharmacy. I don't know how the direct entry program works at the schools you applied at, but for mine, you could get a BS after 4 years so a lot of people got the BS and went a different route. Get some experience during undergrad so that you can change routes if you change your mind before too late and figure out if it's something you really want to do and can do for perhaps rest of your life.

<TEXT> I’ll be a P2 (5th year) started as a freshman at a 7 year program. The school depends on what kind of program you go to (4 year program at a big college or a 6/7 year program in a small private). Basically from my first year in college up to now, it has been all about pharmacy. Everyone has the same goal (there are a few who drop out or change fields) and take the same classes so you get a lot of support from other people. There are pros and cons though. The pro is that you really get to focus on your goal and get to build a closer relationship with people in your class. The con is that you probably won’t get any exposure to other non pharmacy fields. That was actually the problem with me. I found out about the saturation of market my P1 year and was debating on going to med school instead. Then I realized med school isn’t the route for me and I enjoyed interning at retail so I decided that I would stay in this route. Almost all classes I have taken has some sort of pharmacy involved. We had some pharmacy related calculations in calculus, sociology and even history had a pharmacy aspect to it. If you really like learning about how drugs work, then the classes will be interesting to you. Once you get into actual pharmacy school you’ll do more of compounding, math used in pharmacy, counseling and some clinical things as well. Usually in the summer, you’ll spend about 3 weeks-month working in an actual pharmacy under a preceptor.

But as the other person said, try getting some tech experience so you know what goes on in a pharmacy and see what a pharmacist does. And most importantly if you can see yourself doing that for a living. As much as reddit can be helpful in learning new things, the general environment is negative towards students wanting to go into pharmacy. Look at some financial costs and potential market when you graduate and make sure it’s not a decision you’ll regret. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work at cvs but did a rotation at Walgreens couple of months ago. They basically pulled one med, fill and put the med back. My store is fairly busy so we would pull for about 20-30 scripts at once and then put them back only when there was no more room. It drove me crazy just doing things that way at Walgreens. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a guy who was complaining that he got a call that something was ready when he didn’t order it. If it was filled by us, then fine I can change the automatic refill or put the rx on hold. But of course it’s filled at another location that we don’t have control over and he gets angry because he only comes to our pharmacy.  I told him to call the customer service number to stop the calls but he refuses. For some reason it doesn’t register with him that WE HAVE NO FREAKING CONTROL OVER THE CALLS OR WHAT A DIFFERENT PHARMACY FILLS. Honestly I just want people who get angry over calls to transfer to a different retail and find out the calls don’t stop there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's certainly not a bad thing to try out. If you can tolerate it/enjoy being in retail, then pharmacy could be your potential goal. I'm not gonna get into the whole oversaturation thing and wage cuts, so if you don't know about it, I would suggest you check it out. Personally, I don't tell people to leave the pharmacy field because I don't know what you're like so I shouldn't tell you what to do or don't do. If you think it's worth it, then go for it, if not, then it's just a new experience for you to learn from. (Sorry I got off track but there's just too many people on reddit who will argue pharmacy is the worst decision you can make. I don't believe in scaring people away from the field).

Retail is bad because you have to deal with the public. You've got demanding people who will blame things on you that you have no control over. There are also going to demands and tasks that you have to do with little time to do them because of hour cuts. You have to make phone calls, do trainings, fill scripts, ring people up and put in scripts in to the system and answer phone calls when there's a line of people waiting to be helped (also depends on your store too). Honestly though, I don't think it's too bad. All my coworkers are great, all the pharmacists are great and even though there are some shitty moments where you're dealing with an upset customer or during a rush, when you truly help someone (like finding a discount card for them), you feel like you've done something to make an impact in someone's life. When I first heard about retail pharmacy, I told myself I would never get into retail. 3 years of trying to find an intern job, I finally got one and I've learned that it's not as bad as I thought it would be. It is a possibility in my future as a pharmacist.

You'll be put in a situation where you will have no idea what to do when you first start out. Don't be afraid to ask questions and watch your coworkers. Once you learn the ropes, you will find that there are so many opportunities to learn new things. And most importantly, use this experience to figure out if pharmacy is really for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't know if this would be considered a scandal. But had a tech verifying scripts and doing the final verification in the pharmacy by typing in the pharmacist's credentials because she didn't want to wait for the pharmacist. Got caught and got fired. I've heard a lot of bad things about her, haven't seen it myself since I didn't really work with her. She's now working for a grocery store pharmacy, came back to our store and asked to use someone else's discount card. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're right, it's happening all around us. I shouldn't have said it's just statistics. I just meant that it doesn't determine the life you're going to have. I know a lot of pharmacists who are happy, even in retail. As I was saying, my manager just thrives from the corporate environment. He loves interacting with patients, and doesn't mind the pressure or the metrics at all. We don't know what OP is like. They might do really well in retail, they might do so well in school, get a residency and get a clinical job right out of residency. Of course, that requires some risk taking and that's where the statistics come in. It's up to OP if they want to go against the current statistics and take the risk or just avoid the field completely. It should be used as a reference and determine what they really want but not the reason to run away if it's their only dream. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right I should have worded that differently. In science, yes statistics are crucial. I'm just saying that do you let statistics determine your life? Do you not dispense a medication because there is a chance that there may be a rare serious side effect? In some cases yes, but you weigh the benefits and risks associated with it.  If your goal is to get into some high ranking ivy league school, do you give up completely because they have a low acceptance rate? It's really hard to become a celebrity but do people give up their dreams because the percentage of being a popular actor/actress is so low? Yes it is more likely that you're going to have a harder time getting a job and have your wages cut, but do you run away from  your dreams because there is a chance that you might just fail? Life is all about taking risks and going against the statistics. Some are more willing to take that risk, some aren't. That's why I was telling OP, don't let the statistics determine your life. Use it as a reference but if it is truly your dream, don't let it be the reason for not taking that path. </TEXT>

Since you said that it was someone you’ve never talked to before, chances are that it was a new pharmacist or floater.

<TEXT> I work at a fairly busy cvs (about 2500+/week, second busiest in district). Saturdays are as bad as Mondays, even with most doctor’s offices being closed. We’ve got a constant stream of people, and add to the fact that it’s only one tech + pharmacist for the entire day compared to 4 techs on Monday. We had a floater today, especially known to be bad. I think we’ve had more people come by so it was so much worse. Basically this floater only did verifying and answer phone calls, leaving me to deal with 2 lines of drive thru about 4 cars deep and 4-5 people waiting at pick up. For the majority of my shift I couldn’t even touch production at all, pretty much dealing with waiters when they came back (for the second time to pick them up) while leaving all these people picking up hanging. And what’s worse, I’ve been an intern for about 8-9 months and this floater didn’t know some things that even I knew (like checking what the patient paid previously and the help desk number). I had to rely on texting my staff pharmacist for help. Almost all of our waiters ended up waiting for over an hour because I had to deal with patients picking up and the floater didn’t even fill the waiters, just kept on verifying data entry and telling me to fill them, while I was ringing up all these people.

I’ve covered for someone couple times at another store, they’re a non 24 hour store so they had about 20 pages in production. When I worked there and I was less stressed out there than I did today because the pharmacist at least tried to help me. All of the other floaters I had were pretty decent, one who was actually my RA freshmen year and one who’s a full time professor at my school. There was another one who was really good that I had about 2 hours to just put up truck on a Monday. I have never had a pharmacist so bad that really made me hate my life and my job and just wanted to cry there. If I learned anything today, it is if I stay in retail after pharmacy school, I’m not going to be like this floater. Some pharmacists might not value what techs do but I’m going to try my best to help out the techs and prioritize the flow of the pharmacy, not just getting my own work done.

I’m fine being in a busy pharmacy, I can handle customer complaints. But I was just so frustrated that I needed to rant here.

tl;dr floater refuses to ring out people or fill, making people wait for over an hour and leaving me to put out the fire all over the place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It’s really up to you. How much do you want to be a pharmacist? Are you in it for the money, or do you think it’ll be a good match for you? Will you regret it if it takes you a long time to find a job after graduation or are you willing to stick it out until the end? Is there another job that you would want to pursue if it wasn’t pharmacy? Even if it’s not a 6 figure job, would you still want it?

If the answer is yes I want to be a pharmacist no matter what, then go for it. If it’s financially reasonable, do what you want to do.
If there’s any doubt that you have to have a high paying job or stability or think that you’ll regret it in the future, weigh your options. Is there another field you might have an interest in? Is pharmacy still the best option for you?
This forum is pretty divided. A lot of people will say don’t go into pharmacy. People like me will tell you do what you want to do/best for you. It’s really up to you to decide what is the most important for you and be prepared to accept the results from your decisions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don’t feel bad about not knowing much. We’ve all been there and I’ve made far worse mistakes. The transfer pad is basically a pad of paper that has the words “transferred prescription” or something like that at the top. It has all the necessary information to transfer a script so that you don’t forget anything but if you can’t find any, any piece of paper will do.

And don’t worry too much about customer complaints. The pharmacist knows that you’re new so it’s reasonable that you’re not going to know how to do a lot of the stuff yet. That’s the nature of retail and unfortunately people are going to be upset no matter how hard you try to please them. Just focus on learning how to do things and doing them well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on the type of residency. For hospital/clinical they definitely want hospital experience. If you want to do community residency, probably more retail experience. They have a rubric in assessing candidates preinterview and I think it was like 3 or 5 points just for having relevant pharmacy experience. I think other than grades, they also had leadership experience, volunteering and research? I looked up the rubric a while ago so I don’t know it off the top of my head but I can probably give you a link later. </TEXT>

It’ll prepare you so much for your community rotation and eventually when you graduate. I got my first job second semester of P1 and it really helped me get my mind off of studying and classes when I needed a distraction. If you get a good manager/coworkers, having a job isn’t too much of a burden. </TEXT>

From what I know technicians aren’t responsible for transferring scripts from/to other pharmacies, only pharmacists do. To create a new profile, search by name,dob and it should give you an option to add new patient (A). It won’t come up just by searching name. If you get a call from a patient asking to transfer a script from say Walgreens, just write down the necessary info on the transfer pad (usually all you need is patient name, dob, address, other pharmacy name, phone number (if possible) or address, drug name and when they want it. Check with your pharmacist what info they want. If it’s the other pharmacy wanting a copy (transfer prescription), just put call on hold for the pharmacist </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to be a P2 and I seriously thought about med school last year (could have gotten my BS and then left the program) but honestly I didn't have any confidence that I could've beat all the competition to get a seat in the residency. Med students were generally one of the best/high performing students in undergrad and I didn't know if I could be the best among the best. With pharmacy, you could get by without a residency. Sure it's not going to be a desirable job (retail) but it is still a possibility. I know times are changing and pretty soon residency is going to be the norm. And I was drawn to the appeal of community pharmacy so I didn't know there was such a thing as residency until I came into college. I've chosen my path and I'm going to stick with it because even if I wanted to change, I can't. I tell people choose what is realistic for you but also something you want to do. But students need to consider other options, not just PA or MD because pretty soon they're gonna get saturation problem if everyone flocks over to that side. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depends on the setting too. In community it’s more about being friendly and empathize with patients but also firm in saying no you will not fill a control because it’s too early or even banning a customer if you need to. But also being flexible in the workflow (like filling and ringing up people if all the techs are busy helping people or doing other stuff and they’re behind). You have to figure out what to prioritize. Do you want to be a good pharmacist who is liked by all the patients, a hardworking pharmacist who is liked by your boss or a pharmacist who helps people? As much as it’s good that you’re trying to see if it’s good for you, it’s hard to say yes or no. I was an introvert (kind of changed after meeting my best friend) so I thought I would be horrible with dealing with people. Turns out it’s an aspect I enjoy about community pharmacy (still get sick of them after a while though). If you really want to make sure, I would suggest getting a tech job. It’ll tell you so much about the job and if it’s worth it for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don’t think retail is too bad. Sure there’s rude people who want their meds without having to wait or get angry that pharmacists are just doing their jobs but that’s just one or two out of 50 ish people. The reason why it is not a desired job is because of hour cuts and more metrics. Basically they give you more requirements (calls, shots, enrollment in the rewards program) but cut tech hours so the pharmacist has to do everything but not enough time to do them all. It’s more obvious if you work in retail but it’s all about profit for the corporate whereas the pharmacist just wants to do their job and help people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It depends. It could be like someone wants you to change something on their profile (enroll on readyfill....etc) or fill a prescription and you didn’t get the chance to do it while the patient was there and then you forget their name. It could be that you expedited something but accidentally pressed home. As long as they are the last person that you searched it should pop up again.

Another thing is sometimes a person had a med for years and just transferred in, so it marks it as a first fill (mandatory). Instead of just handing them straight off to the pharmacist, see if it’s the first time they’ve had it and then if they need counseling, hand them off. Saves everyone time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that financially pharmacy is not the best decision. If it's just all about the numbers, it's simple. My brother spent well over 200k just for undergrad bachelors at a top school for a math degree that is probably more useless than pharmacy. He first pursued the med school route, which would have been financially better, he would probably make more money as a doctor than doing something with psych + math doctorate degree, but he hated doing bio and just medical stuff. And I just want to say we're not very rich. Our parents wanted to support us throughout college and they work their butts off trying to keep us financially stable and took out loans from the bank (not exactly student loans but a loan nevertheless). Finance is relevant to my family, it's not like we can spend without worrying about anything. But my brother doesn't care about the fact that he won't make much as a professor/teacher/psychologist whatever he wants to be because that's his passion. And in Asian culture making a lot of money/prestige is a very important thing. And honestly, I think that that's  not a bad decision. Knowing my brother, doing what he loves is more important than money despite what our parents say. That's why I think finances isn't everything. If that was the case, we wouldn't have artists or writers. There are few who produce great works and make billions but more who are not as successful. But there still are people who pursue doctorate in what we would consider useless degrees. It all comes down to how much you want it and how much you're willing to sacrifice for it. A good decision isn't black and white. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't have an exact number but I'm from a different country where the salaries are probably about 50k (with lower cost of living) so I don't really have a high expectation (I mean it's a plus but it's not the determining factor for me). There's just a lot of factors in obtaining a license back in my home country that's making me hesitant to go back just yet, but I would be prepared to practice as a pharmacist there even though the salary is half of what it is here.  And I'm fortunate enough to not have to take out any loans. I know not everyone has the option of being loan free and that market is a very much relevant issue for a lot of people. I just hope that people look at all sides and choose what is most realistic/ideal for them and not just be scared away. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Same story. I went into it at first because I was interested in chemistry/drugs and wanted to help people. Part of it was my mom wanting me to get a stable professional job (neither of us knew much about the market honestly). After starting interning at cvs and learning about drugs in p1 year really increased my interest and cleared up doubts about my choice. When I first read about the state of the market, I seriously had doubts and was debating about med school. But I can’t imagine myself doing anything else because it really matches my interests and personality (even retail). I don’t want to go into a job just because of stability or the money, I want to choose something that I know is right for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’ll be a P2 in the fall, I went to a 7 year program as a freshman so my sole goal was being a pharmacist. Before then, I volunteered at an outpatient pharmacy for about a year but that was all I knew about the profession. I was interested in the field but part of it was a push from my parents. About a year ago, I read about the saturation and the horrors of retail pharmacy and that’s when I started having doubts. I was considering med school after I got my bachelors but I probably would have had to take a gap year to get my application ready and study for MCAT. That was before I started interning at CVS. After I started working, I found that I really enjoyed communicating with patients and being in the community. It can be a stressful environment, even more as a pharmacist but I found it to be rewarding. That was when I truly knew that I wanted to stay on the pharmacy route. I really like the fact that pharmacists are one of the most accessible health care professionals and I really want to help people even if it’s a simple question. No matter what happens in the future, I’ll deal with the consequences because it’s my life and my choice that I made.

My advice for you is to truly find out if this is for you. If you haven’t, work as a tech or even volunteer at a pharmacy. If it is what you really want, stick with it. School won’t be easy and there will be a lot of requirements demanded from you. I don’t want to discredit anyone because their complaints are legitimate and there definitely are a lot of flaws in the system and the profession. I respect everyone in this field for everything they do and have gone through. But there are a lot of people who really love their jobs (even in retail). It is for you to figure out what you want, work for it and live with the consequences. Good luck and hope everything goes well for you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m kind of at a similar situation, not as bad as yours though. There’s two part time, me and another student. I get 5 hours/week and the other person gets about 20 even though I have full time availability. With 3 other full time people, we get about 140 hours/week, much less than what we used to get before the hour cuts. One full time person went on vacation, and I got about 15 whereas the other person got 32. And our manager hired a new tech recently. I guess that part makes sense since we’re both students so once school starts up again we won’t be able to work as much.  I understand that the other part time person has been working longer but it’s really hard being in that situation. I constantly worry if I screw up something and doing something wrong. Honestly I try hard not to bring it up because I don’t want to be demanding and I try to be grateful for what I have. Hang in there and if it continues, see if you can transfer to a store that can give you more hours </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don’t give up before you even try. Pharmacy experience isn’t a requirement, it may look good but not having experience will not mean a rejection from the school. Have a good reason for choosing pharmacy, show your passion for the field and it can make up for the lack of experience. Most of all, try to make the best of the time you have and do well on pcat. It doesn’t have to be pharmacy related, it can just be a community service thing or research. Make sure to relate it to your interests and elaborate it on the application. A lot of pharmacy schools do have low standards, having a low GPA won’t be the determining factor. If need be, you can always take a gap year before applying again. You can try to get a tech job, or even medical scribe if that interests you. Don’t feel pressured to have to get into a school right after or it will never happen. Don’t worry about all that and just focus on getting a good PCAT score and building up your resume. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It requires a lot of work/studying academically but one of my favorite parts is being able to apply that in the real world. It’s really different being able to take blood pressure on a patient compared to an arm model or your friend for practice. When you’re studying actual drugs, it just feels like a lot of information that you’re trying to cram before an exam but when a patient asks you a question about it, it really feels good being able to recommend an OTC product. I just finished my first rotation this year and at first it felt like a drag but I learned so much and was able to do things I couldn’t do in a classroom or even at work. It requires a lot of hard work being able to recite facts like ADR or strength of a medication but you see yourself grow and progress during rotations.

There’s a lot of pharmacy schools popping up left and right so the biggest thing is to check how old they are. The older they are, more connections they will likely have with pharmacists so you’ll have more options for rotations. Also check the Naplex pass rate because if half of the graduates can’t pass a minimum proficiency test, it tells you something about the quality of the education at the school. If finances is a concern, try to choose the cheapest option. You can have over 100-200k in loans and the decrease in pay/hours and availability of jobs may make it a challenge to pay it off. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My pharmacist actually enjoys his job as a manger in retail. He says the worst thing about the job is multiple 14 hour shifts, not the people or the pressure. We’re a pretty busy pharmacy (though not as bad compared to others but can’t tell you how many scripts because I don’t know), tech hours got cut and all that retail stuff. He tries his best to deal with customer complaints, and sure there are shitty days but I’ve never seen him complain once like he hated his job. Even though retail seems like the worst choice to others, there are people who really enjoy interacting with the public and and just working in the community. It’s his positive attitude that makes me enjoy working with him and in retail.

I also had a preceptor at another retail, been manager for couple of years. He’s looking for opportunities in LTC because that’s what he enjoys doing and also helping HIV patients. He covers shifts whenever he can and just goes out to reach his goal.

It really depends on the person. There are people who do well under pressure and really enjoy retail. But at the end of the day, there’s going to be stress and quotas in every occupation. I see a lot of people recommending med school instead but doctors are just as stressed and busy, but about different things. It’s not about trying to choose the easiest job, it’s about choosing what’s for you. It’s important to educate people on the reality because so many students have a false sense of reality and I’m guilty of that. I’ve really learned a lot from this forum and respect everyone in pharmacy for what they do but I don’t think trying to scare everyone away is the answer. </TEXT>

It does get easier with time though so don’t fret too much. The good rx or coupons will say cash discount so that’s how you know those are the ones.

<TEXT> It really depends on what kind of position you want to work at the hospital. Outpatient pharmacies are typically similar to retail/grocery stores. Pharmacists dispense, verify, check for drug interactions, contraindications, safety, and will counsel people, give vaccinations, stuff like that. If you go into a more clinical role in hospitals, you will work with doctors in recommending medications, monitoring for efficacy and sometimes working with the formularies.

But you should definitely get a job, even as a tech in retail. Make sure that it is what you want to do before you set your goal. Explore for other options, you may find something that you like more. While I don't want to bash on hopes, the state of the market is going down and it requires a lot of passion if you really want to go that route. You have to decide for yourself if the tuition and time is worth the end result of potentially being stuck in retail. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Being a doctor is very different from being a pharmacist. I was thinking about med school in the middle of pharmacy school and so I told my parents. And then I started interning at a retail pharmacy and thought that this is actually what fits me and I talked to my parents again. I felt like I was letting them down but they understood that it’s what matters to me, not what school I go to. I’ll be honest and say pharmacy school is not an easier route. It may be in some aspects but you still have to study a lot to basically know these medications by heart. But I believe that if you’re passionate about what you study, you can get through it. Don’t put yourself down because you’re not good enough for med school. Pharmacy is just as important as medicine and doesn’t make you any less valuable by becoming a pharmacist. Just understand what you really want and persuade your parents. Talk to them about why you want this more and why medicine isn’t for you </TEXT>

<TEXT> I work at cvs but I did a 3 weeks rotation at Walgreens. The computer system is kind of hard to get into it at first (especially because I was used to a different system) but I think I learned majority of the system within 2 weeks. The best thing is to ask people how to do things and do it yourself. Merely watching them won’t help much because a lot of it is done through the keyboards and you’ll have a hard time figuring out what they just did. It can be overwhelming at first if it’s busy, but you’ll get the hang of it within the month. It is meant to be an entry level job so you won’t have a problem adapting to it.

This is just a general new pharm tech advice but keep notes in a small notebook. You may not need to look at it in the future but sometimes it’s good to brush up on stuff and you won’t have to ask people for the same question multiple times.  You also won’t be expected to know specifically medical information, but it’s good to know what they do and generic/brand names. You’ll learn more as you get more exposure and experience and just knowing stuff like statins are cholesterol drugs or -mycins are antibiotics will help you in answering basic questions about the drugs. And most of all, just enjoy the experience. It’s a different world from other retail jobs and you’ll learn a lot. Build a good relationship with your manager/coworkers and the patients and treat it like a learning experience. </TEXT>

Have questions ready so that you can get a conversation going. Most times they may not remember you months after but if you see them again, remind them. So say like “I’ve talked with you last time when _____, I have a question about what you said last time” or even just ask about current issues. The key is to make them remember you.

I did a year of volunteer work at outpatient pharmacy in a hospital but that’s about it. My decision to go into it was partly due to push from my mom. I attend a 7 year program so I didn’t really have any exposure to any other field before going into the pharmacy program. But if I had to make that choice again, I would make the same choice. Pharmacy, retail especially is unlike I imagined (I grew up in a different country so I had a different image of pharmacy) but I still like the fact that pharmacists are one of the most accessible health care professionals. Retail has its cons, like customers, but I enjoy building relationships with them and just being able to help with their problems.  Despite the lack of recognition of pharmacists and being treated like a fast food restaurant, I still find it rewarding. At the end of the day, I know I’m gonna get sick of my job no matter what I choose. Each has its own problems but I want to make the most out of what I feel is best for me and explore multiple options that are out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Look at schools and decide which ones you want to apply to
2. Look at requirements and make sure to get those classes done
3. Find/build relationships with professors (assuming you’re still in undergrad?) who can give you a good rec letter (preferably STEM classes)
4. Look at the pharmcas application process so that you’ll be prepared
5. Try to get a job in pharmacy, so you really know you want to go into that field

It’s really no different from med school/ grad school in general in that you should try to get good grades, do a lot of extracurriculars and get good rec letters. The only thing is making sure this really is something you want to do because of all the stories I’m sure you’ve heard of about pharmacy. You could look into different fields in pharmacy but you’ll be learning a lot and experiencing a lot in pharmacy school so don’t be pressured to decide on what kind of pharmacist you want to be. Getting a pharmacy job now will help you a lot from boosting your resume, understanding pharmacy, having relevant stuff to talk about in interviews and getting more out of rotations/internships (because you won’t spend all that time trying to learn just the basics). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, it really depends on where you work and who you work with. Yes corporate will always be corporate. There will be hour cuts and unrealistic expectations. Walgreens is just as same because in the end, they are for profit businesses. You’re going to get shitty customers. But if you have a good relationship with your coworkers and superior, it’s really not that bad. I work at the pharmacy and recent hour cuts has been bad, like I don’t get scheduled much and rush hours with just me and the pharmacist get really crazy and stressful. But I’ve got coworkers who’re willing to give me their hours and pharmacists who try to make it better for all of us. That’s what makes it worth it and I don’t regret choosing retail </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really depends on the store, there are good cvs stores and bad Walgreens stores. I’m an intern at cvs, doing my rotations at Walgreens, I find that the computer system at cvs is much simpler (could be the fact that I’ve been working longer). Like you have all the options laid out at the bottom whereas you have to dig for options in the Walgreens system. I also don’t like how at Walgreens you only scan one stock bottle most of the time and can’t even scan rts bottles. But that’s just my preference. </TEXT>

It’s usually a process like couple of write ups and then after that you’re let go so unless you make a very big mistake, you won’t have to worry about losing your job. I have seen someone get fired for one mistake but that was something like a pharmacy tech trying to play pharmacist and verify prescriptions without teh pharmacist’s knowledge which is a huge legal issue, not just a company policy.

If you get a chance, try working in the pharmacy too. It’s a different world than just retail and you’ll learn a lot about the health care system/drugs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It looks good on resume, yes, but it doesn’t hold as much significance as an actual experience of working. If you look at evaluation rubric for residencies, there is a lot of point dedicated just for having experience in that field. For retail/community pharmacies, they don’t really matter much because they’re not very relevant. You’re going to be competing against other grads who have been working/interning for years with the company and people who have been working at other companies. In their eyes, it will take more resources to train you and can be more of a liability since you don’t have the experience in the field and haven’t dealt with different situations. Even a month of rotations won’t expose you to all the different situations. With tech hours being cut, you’re essentially going to have to do all the tech duties on the side, so it’s better for you to have experience and get used to it. And it will also help you know the medicines. You’ll know the brand, generic and the uses off by heart even before you learn them in school. That’ll make things much easier to relate and memorize. It’s not just a resume booster, you will learn so much about pharmacy and everything that goes on in health care. </TEXT>

Other than that, just brush past it and move on. They’re not worth stressing about for the rest of the day. My pharmacists understand that we have some shitty customers and we just laugh about how crazy they are. When you have someone who understands that the customer is crazy, not you, it feels so much better. Unfortunately, you just have to learn not to take everything seriously. </TEXT>

<TEXT> 2 + 3 CVS and Walgreens systems are not connected, meaning that you won't be able to know what they fill at Walgreens/Rite Aid/ basically any other pharmacy besides CVS. In the case of controlled substances, the PDMP tells you every control substance they have filled regardless of pharamcy. The way you transfer prescriptions from Walgreens is to get a copy from the Walgreens and for them to transfer it out. As a tech, you don't have to worry about that because that's the rph's job.

4. Usually it means reverse the claim on the insurance. Say you fill a prescription and the patient decides to not pick it up and transfer it to a different pharmacy. You would have to reverse the claim from the insurance so that the other pharmacy can fill it.

<TEXT> It depends on the state on whether or not you need the national certification. Missouri, for example, doesn’t require you to, although it will give you some pay raise and be more desirable in the market, but in Illinois, you have to within a certain time limit. The first step is to get a technician license with the State Board of Pharmacy, usually just an application, picture and fingerprints. Retail (such as cvs, Walgreens, rite aid) is a good place to start because they will assist you with training and getting certified. After that, you can go to different places, such as hospital, long term care or mail order. It depends on your interests, being a tech isn’t related to biology or chemistry as much. You can learn what the drug does but not so much about how they work. You’ll learn a lot about insurance, and bulk of the work will be filling prescription and customer service at least in retail. It is a good experience, much different from other jobs.

 It really depends on whether it is worth it or not. What is your goal? Do you want to make a career out of this or is this just a stepping stone for something else? </TEXT>

<TEXT> This probably won’t mean much but it will definitely get better. I was only working 11 hours a week so it was harder getting used to things but I got the hang of it and I would say I was pretty confident in most things about a month in. Unfortunately, that’s the nature of retail. Some people will understand that you’re new but there also will be people who “don’t give a fuck” as someone told me. Not quite sure if it works the same way in your system since I work at the other big retail store but when I found out that you can search people by their phone number or a space before the dob it really saved my life. I usually search people on the computer first when I do drive thru. If I happen to miss what they want and catch one word of the sentence, I would ask something relevant like did you want a refill or did you need something else? Some people may be pissed but they usually give a direct answer rather than their life story. It’s tough just being put in the workflow as a brand new tech but it seems like the pharmacy staff is supportive so if you are unsure about something, ask them. </TEXT>

I believe your intern license allows you to work as a tech, but you will not be able to do any intern duties while classified as a tech due to liability issues. I’m surprised that the DM wants you to stay as tech because the other big retail company that I work for doesn’t allow pharmacy students to work as tech. If you have a lot of experience as a tech, the pay cut might be worth it to actually experience pharmacist duties. If not, it’s probably not the worst thing to work tech duties for a year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's 2 options: going to a 4-year college and then going to pharmacy school, or going to a direct entry program (usually 6 or 7 year programs).

4 year "traditional route": you can choose a different path after getting your bachelors , you get more exposure to different programs, you get more non-pharmacy related electives, basically not everything on campus is about pharmacy related stuff

Direct entry program: pretty much everyone is pursuing the same degree so you get more help from others, you learn A LOT about pharmacy in your undergrad years, some schools have easier process of going into the professional program (not having to take the PCAT and not having to apply), not sure about other schools but ours offer a bachelors after 4 years, very pharmacy focused, a lot of pharmacy organizations.

I would choose the second option if you know you want to go into pharmacy more than anything else. The reason being you don't get that much exposure to other fields and if you decide to change your mind, you have no idea what to do because all you know is about pharmacy. You could potentially finish school in 6 years either way (since you don't need a BS to go to pharmacy school). What I like about the direct entry program is that you get to know your classmates really well and we help each other out with class stuff and you learn to think like a health care professional from undergrad but I wish we had more diverse electives and not be surrounded by pharmacy-related stuff all the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m an intern, been working in retail for about 6 months now. Modules can help you if you try hard to learn from it but it’s not necessary. It’s frustrating to most of us especially having to reset over and over again.

In regards to making mistakes, they do happen. I’ve made some serious ones and not so serious ones. I gave someone else’s meds, forgot to put in a medicine in the bag (they had over 10 rx to pick up) and got yelled at by the customer, put the drugs in a wrong bottle so many little things. But at the end of the day, they were either caught by the pharmacist or the customer. As a tech most if not all of your mistakes will be caught by the pharmacist. You just accept and learn from it. I was pretty anxious too when I found out I made a big mistake but nothing serious happened. I’m studying to be a pharmacist where I will have more responsibilities and my errors can actually cause harm. But I’ve really enjoyed my time in community pharmacy and I would probably choose it again if I had to regardless of all the problems. It’s a good experience and don’t worry too much about making errors. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the biggest thing is take notes. You're going to be swamped with so much information in a short amount of time, it'll take you a while to master them and be able to do most duties on your own. Taking notes looks good on you on the standpoint of the pharmacist/other techs and also helps you to keep track of things and also to remind yourself how to do things.

Secondly, enjoy it. Don't start off your job on a wrong note by expecting the worst from the customers and having a negative attitude about the fact that it's a retail job. When I first started, I really loved to learn and enjoyed going in for work and it really helped me deal with some of the difficult customers. And the more positive attitude you have, the more your coworkers will like you.

Finally, don't get frustrated. It'll be tough the first few weeks with learning the system and being in a high-paced environment. But don't worry, it happens to everyone and it doesn't make you a bad tech. You might make mistakes, but just own up and learn from it. I've had some bad mistakes and some of the experienced RPh's make mistakes. If you make one mistake, don't get scared and let that drive you away from the job. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know there are crazier interactions with patients out there but this is the oddest one I've had in the 6 months I've worked in retail that left me very confused.

There was an older lady who came with a pack of labels and asked me a question.

OL = older lady

Me: Hi how can I help you today?

OL: Do you know if these labels are sticky on the back so that you can stick them? I can't see anywhere on the package

Me: Umm.....(looks at the package even though I probably didn't need to). Yes? I haven't seen any labels that aren't sticky on the back.

OL: Oh okay. I just want to make sure. I know most are, but it doesn't say on the package. Can I return these if they don't?

Me: I think so?

A) I'm very confused why she's coming to the pharmacy for this question

B) Why she would think labels that are meant to stick on the envelop would have no sticker part on the back

OL: Oh and I have couple of prescriptions to pick up.

Okay... that makes sense. I still don't understand why she would need to ask that.

Rings up her stuff.....she uses a couple of coupons

the labels were about 10ish dollars and the meds are about 3 dollars, she uses a $10 and $2 off coupons

Me: I can only use the $10 coupon because you can't use the coupon on the medications.

OL: Why is that?

At this point my coworker comes to help me out. CW = coworker

CW: It's the law that you can't use coupon on medications. If you see here on the coupon, it says you can't use it for medications.

OL: You know what? You can explain it to me all day long and I won't understand it.

Coworker goes away and I give her back the $2 coupon.

OL: why are you giving this back?

Me: I can't use it on the medications but you can use it for front store items.

OL: well if it didn't work on these, they're not going to work for those items are they? I guess the $10 coupon didn't work on the labels either.

Me: uh.....yeah (I was done trying to explain at this point)

OL: You know what, don't even bother. I won't understand anyway.

&#x200B;

TL;DR lady comes to pharmacy to ask if labels have a sticky part on the back and refuses to understand coupons work on front store items but not medications </TEXT>

<TEXT> I did that and it actually worked out for me. When I applied, I didn't know interns couldn't be techs and I would have jumped at any chance to get a pharmacy job. The pharmacy manager was pretty desperate for a person and he was willing to hire me as a tech, work for couple of months and just change my title to intern. The hiring manager emailed me and said that I needed to apply as an intern again since I couldn't be a tech. I applied, got accepted and got put in the pharmacy that I originally applied at. It worked out because I'm at a retail pharmacy with an internship program. I don't know how responsive they are when people apply for intern positions because they're not looking to fill positions. I would say it helped me because there was that connection between the pharmacy manager and the intern coordinator/district leader </TEXT>

But I noticed that the subfolders in DCIM don't really "reset" like if I deleted all the photos in 100APPLE folder, it creates a 101APPLE folder for the next photos instead of filling in the spot of the deleted photos. So I was curious what happens if I reach 999APPLE folder. Would it go back to 100APPLE folder or not be able to take anymore pictures? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In all fairness, people who liked their job wouldn’t come to an online forum talking about how much they love their jobs. Keep in mind that this proportion is very distorted and in any job there’s going to be people who hate their jobs. That being said it doesn’t mean you should discredit them, but just bear caution when you take the opinions of people online. It’s really best for you to experience what it’s like in a pharmacy and get a job as a tech. If you still decide to pursue pharmacy, then no the undergrad major really doesn’t matter. You can major in English and still get into pharmacy schools. Either degree will get you a fair amount of background in science classes. The graduate school and everything else that comes after depends on what you want to do like do you want to do drug research or do you actually want to be a pharmacist? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, internships, especially health care related can be hard to find  because students wanting to go to med school or anything along those lines all try to get internships. Doesn't mean you shouldn't try but don't get discouraged if you can't find anything. But working at the hospital is something. It gets you a foot in the door,and you can also make connections.

Being an Asian myself, I volunteered at a local non-profit organization for Korean-Americans. I basically helped out at the office, just cleaning but also helping with events and stuff. If there's an organization like that near you, that would be a good place to start. All of our volunteering is through school so it's kind of hard to say what kind of things you can do on your own. If you're bilingual, you can play that to your advantage. You can volunteer at events held by other organizations but use your bilingualism so that you can reach out to more minorities. It'll take some creativity to come up with ways to link things but once you can make a connection with someone, you'll get more opportunities.

As for the mission statement, I agree that you can't control what the admissions will believe but I highly doubt that it will be the determining factor of your admission. Don't think of it as something really big but an opportunity to tell them about you and your story on why you want this. I actually think your reason is good. Mine was as simple as I like learning about chemistry and drugs and how they work and I want to help people. Pharmacy really is about helping people manage and adhere to their medications and minority outreach is a big thing. If you can just elaborate on that, I don't think you need to worry too much about it.

And as far as grade goes, I don't think there's a certain grade you need for each subject. It is to my understanding that they look at the Science/math GPA compared to your overall GPA but one B in biology isn't going to be hurt you a whole lot. Don't worry about the AP score, it really means nothing in the eyes of admissions or your ability to learn the material. Study as  how  you studied in college and don't let that one test scare you away from learning the material. I found that it gets stressful when I try to study for the sake of taking the test but when I study to learn, it's much more enjoyable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Before you decide on anything, get some experience (which you're already planning to do anyway so whatever). I'm guessing you want to go into community pharmacy if you have a desire to help a specific population, so definitely try retail and/or independent. There's probably going to be a lot of people telling you to stay away because of saturation and overall status of pharmacists in the view of the public and it is true. But I find community pharmacy to be rewarding in its own way despite it and if you feel the same way, then you should definitely try. I  didn't take biology in college (got AP biology credit in high school but literally remember nothing from it) and it didn't impact me at all. With your grades, I would say it's realistic and just remember that these admissions people probably have heard of all kinds of reasons why students want to go into pharmacy. Don't waste time trying to find a unique reason and focus on what is important to you and find ways to demonstrate your passion. You've still got a couple years, find healthcare related volunteer opportunities or do some projects that will show them that you truly are passionate about this. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't know how you feel about pharmacy and if money is the biggest reason you're going into the field but I wouldn't expect to get a 6 figure salary right off the bat or even after working for years. The saturation is leading to decrease in salary (I'm hearing around $50-55/hr, definitely not as good as what it used to be, and decreasing hours especially in retail.) A lot of people went into pharmacy expecting that 6 figure salary when the demand was high years ago. A lot of them are miserable and would say that the stress of the job isn't worth it. At the very least, get a job as an intern or tech and figure out if you could tolerate doing the job for a living. </TEXT>

I also take notes so I don't have to bother anyone else in the future with the same question. There is one lead tech who's great and works hard but sometimes can annoy customers with little comments and whenever that happens when I'm working with them, the pharmacist thanks me for not causing any other trouble.

<TEXT> I know retail may not be the most desirable job but usually they have an intern program. If there's any CVS or Walgreens in your area they'll hire a lot of pre-pharm and pharmacy students. A lot of people in my class work at shop n' save and schnucks as interns if any of those are in your area (I don't know if they're national chains). You might get lucky at a hospital if you want to try there too (I know a sophomore who got accepted as a tech at a nearby hospital).

It also depends on the state too. Some places will let you work as a tech with an intern license, but you won't be able to do intern pharmacist duties. You could definitely ask them if you can work as a tech as a pharmacy student. But keep looking around and try independents too because you never know if they might have an intern position or not. </TEXT>

Go to pre-interview screening tool, it gives you a breakdown of how they rank you. Basically, for EC, focus on trying to do some research and get leadership positions in national pharmacy organizations like ACCP (clincial), ASHP (hospital), NCPA (community), state pharmacy association and others. If possible, get a hospital job because it is scored more than retail. Keep in mind that with the saturation and unwillingness of graduates to go into retail, more are applying for residency positions. There's going to be people with great GPA and a whole bunch of leadership/EC. The best thing to do is try to stand out as much as possible. You could present your research at ASHP midyear (national conference) and make a lot of connections with pharmacists (connections are really important in the field of pharmacy). Do a lot of rotations in clinical or hospital settings and impress the pharmacists. It's kind of overwhelming to think about so many different things especially since you haven't started school yet, but take whatever opportunities you get and think about how you can go above and beyond as a pharmacy student.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're not screwed, the residency is after pharmacy school, not undergrad. If you haven't started already, start studying for PCAT and look into which pharmacy schools you want to go to. When you apply for residencies, your grade in pharmacy school matter, not your undergrad GPA. I meant that you can begin preparing from the first year of pharmacy school by getting good grades and being involved in different pharmacy organizations. Don't worry about residencies at the moment, just focus on getting good grades so that you can get into the pharmacy school you want to go to. Even as a PY1 or 2 don't worry about it as much, just try to get involved as much as you can and get leadership positions. When you get into PY3, they talk to you more about residencies and applying for them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The only route for clinical is going through the residency. That’s additional 1 or 2 years after graduating working for half the pay of pharmacists. If you want to go that way, I would suggest starting from the first year. Keep your grades up and get involved in pharmacy organizations. Get leadership positions and attend national conferences for the pharmacy organizations. As a pre-pharm student, you could certainly shadow pharmacists. If you want to get paid, you could start as a technician in a hospital and build relationships with the pharmacists. You could get some insights about hospital/clinical pharmacy that way. As a technician, you wouldn’t be able to do anything clinical but you can observe what pharmacists do.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> The thing with specialty pharmacy fields (like nuclear) is that now most pharmacy grads are trying to go that route. Unlike medical field, residency isn’t required to practice as a pharmacist (though it is required for clinical and other positions). So there’s more limited number of residencies and increasing number of students trying to get into them. It might not be the same in the sense of retail pharmacies, but you can say that the saturation is impacting those areas as well. In fact, hospital positions that didn’t require residencies before now require you to have them. There are pgy students who are struggling to find jobs even after residencies. If you have a strong interest in residency, I’m not discouraging you from going this route, but it’s not an ideal path just to get job placement.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a tech, you fill prescriptions, solve insurance problems, do inventory, ring up customers, put in prescriptions into the computer system, answer/make phone calls and pull drugs/put them away. Especially in retail, it's very fast paced and you'll learn a lot but it can be overwhelming at first. You might be able to learn what each drug is for, but you won't learn how they work (that's what pharmacy school is for). In a hospital setting, you would be able to do other things like make IV bags, fill automated dispensing cabinets or run medications to each floor. More often than not people start off at retail/independent and make their way into hospital/long term care or other areas. You'll need to be good at customer service because community pharmacy essentially is dealing with the public. You'll see some crazy things and get yelled at often, but that's the nature of retail and any customer service.   While it's not a very glorified job, techs are essential part of the pharmacy and in the health care system. As to knowing whether it's for you, you just have to try it yourself. Some people think they can deal with the public and end up hating it, and others enjoy their job. Depending on where you work, it can be very stressful, but it's all about how you make of the situation and what you want out of it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don’t think drive thru is too different from pick up. You get the same prompts,  basically same process except they hand you over the card and you put it into the card reader. Also remember to get the slip they sign because you need to scan that at the end.
For lane 2, it’s a little bit different (for us we do pick up too except you can’t send liquids because they’ll explode). How I do it is talk to them on phone (search by dob on computer if you can’t spell their name right), let them know they have x many prescriptions, tell them the price and send over the carrier (button says send carrier). Find the meds, ring it up, put everything in a bag (receipt and card too) so it doesn’t get lost and send it over with the clipboard with the piece of paper to sign. Tell them to sign and wait until they send it back. Usually people know how to send the carrier over but in case they don’t, you just press the button that says bring carrier. The trick with the signed paper is that you have to aim the scanner at 45 degrees, it will just beep at you if you try to scan it straight on. It can be kind of hard at first but once you get used to it, you just have a routine.  </TEXT>

We were generally good about getting things done but we got cut by 50 hours/week recently so I don't really know how bad it's gotten.

<TEXT> We have our state legislative day coming up and some people from the state pharmacy association came to present some issues so that we could be ready. I asked about their thoughts on retail pharmacy cutting technician hours and they said that they don't really want to approach the issue of technician: pharmacist ratio. But the person I was talking to said that a possible solution could be expanding technician roles, like verifying (refills only and they would have to have certification for it) and the pharmacist could have more time for more clinical roles, such as counselling and also pursuing MTS and provider status for pharmacists so that technicians wouldn't necessarily be replacing pharmacists but just enabling them to do more. Any thoughts on this?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your thoughts. I thought it was a pretty good idea, expanding the scope of practice for the pharmacists. I can see why some people might have concerns and why it might not necessarily make the job easier for retail pharmacists. I heard it's currently being practiced in Iowa so I think it's worth looking into. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Totally agree. I work at CVS and I love it mostly because of the people I work with. My PM is really great, he's always teaching me new things and doesn't make a big deal out of metrics (he cares but he's encouraging us to try harder instead of getting angry that we're doing badly) and he never gets mad when I make mistakes. And all the other pharmacists, techs, FS people and SM are really nice. Since you're getting stressed out and everything, it wouldn't hurt to try a different store since it might be better there. Worst comes to worst, you're going from one understaffed/busy store to another one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some other things I've encountered:

If someone's enrolling in extracare card or updating contact info, there's a customer entry button on the bottom right (left?) corner, which makes life so much easier when entering those emails.

When someone brings a new insurance card and need to apply on the prescription they are picking up, go to their profile and do E# and not just the # of the drug and select the one in waiting bin. If you just press the number of the line of the drug, it will apply to the next refill, not the one they are picking up

&#x200B;

These are more on ConnectRx they'll make things so much easier

Alt F1/F2 to toggle between 2 screens. Helps when you're doing PCQ calls and the patient asks a random thing so you have to go into their profile without exiting from the PCQ screen

Print screen (it's one of the buttons on the F buttons on the top), basically prints the screen

when you answer phone calls (or drive thru if you have one) and you can't hear their name, do space + birthday and match the name. This really saved my life.

Don't worry about annoying everyone, first day's always the hardest. I felt the exact same way when I first started. It'll get better and you'll be able to do things without help. Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Even if that is possible, would you be as competitive people who do 7 years of school? There’s an oversupply of newly graduating pharmacists and even more who do residency. And I don’t think just 4 years of undergrad will prepare you for NAPLEX either. I guess if you’re good with just studying with prep books, you can do that but I don’t think it will necessarily equip you with all the knowledge and skills (like compounding or even patient counselling) that you need as a pharmacist. Just because it’s an option doesn’t mean it’s a good one.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah I think the greatest thing about pharmacists is that they’re approachable. With doctors or anyone else, you have to pay a ridiculous amount just to see them. And it’s not like you can just call the doctor’s office to ask a question. One of my favorite parts of working in the pharmacy is taking phone calls because I’m helping people. If it helps you stay adherent and get better, I wouldn’t get angry at anyone for asking questions about their meds.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> My pharmacist typed in the wrong med once, and the verifying pharmacist didn't catch that. Thankfully the patient checked the pills and called because it seemed different. Generally we don't have pages and pages overdue in the queues but 14 hour shifts with very little breaks definitely does not make for a safe working environment for anyone. She's a really good pharmacist and she was just so crushed when she found out. So to people who read this, please check your pills to make sure they're the right ones. Sometimes the appearance changes because the manufacturer decides to change it but if anything seems different, call the pharmacist. We try our best to do things as accurately as possible but we're often rushed and we would rather take a phone call than a patient who takes the wrong med and something happens.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look into direct entry programs like 0-6 or 0-7. These generally don’t require you to take the PCAT, but requires a certain GPA.  In my school we did an interview + writing assessment after junior year. There’s Albany college of pharmacy, Ohio Northern University, St. John’s University, St. Louis College of Pharmacy, northeastern university, Massachusetts college of pharmacy etc. The good things would be that the undergrad courses are focused on pharmacy but our school didn’t have electives like language or non pharmacy related.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It really depends on what you want to do. Both are pretty different careers, with doctors being more hands on with the patients. And with medical school, it not just the 1 or 2 years in undergrad, you’ve also got at least 3-4 years of residency afterwards whereas if you wanted to pursue residency in pharmacy, it’s only 1-2 years. I understand your concern about the market and it’s a valid one. But doctors also have burnouts (pretty much most jobs in health care do). A lot of people went into pharmacy expecting 6 figure salaries and spent their whole life hating their jobs. I don’t know what you want to pursue if you go into pharmacy but there are clinical jobs (granted those are pretty hard to get) which may be just as stimulating as a doctor’s job would be. For many people I know who have switched from pharmacy to medicine, they’ve all done shadowing and that was when they decided medicine was more for them. I wouldn’t decide one or the other before truly understanding what both jobs entail because let’s face it, these jobs aren’t for everyone and you probably don’t want to spend all your life doing something you hate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can't tell you specifically about the schools, but one of the things I like about my school is the small class size (our class is \~200). In undergrad, most of my classes ranged from 7-150, class size typically being around 30. In the professional program, most of our classes is about 100 or 200. I definitely liked the smaller classes better, because the professors knew us personally and I learned better. I actually got involved in research because I got to know a professor really well when I was taking a course in the summer where there were only 10 people. And I have good relationships with a lot of my undergrad professors, which helped me get reference letters when I was applying to jobs. Now that our class is bigger, I don't really know my professors that well and it doesn't feel as personal. If I had to get a reference letter, there's only one professor, only because I took her class over the summer. I also got involved in so many leadership positions. I'm the kind of person who would feel lost in a big crowd of people. If I went to a traditional 4 year university with over 1000 people in each class, I would just go to class and not do any extracurricular activity. My friend at a big university had to interview to get into research, but I just asked the professor if I could do research with her and she let me.  If you're a kind of person who could just go out and make friends, it's probably not a big deal, but like you said, you don't feel like you fit in. At the end of the day, what school you went to won't affect what you do. Maybe you could have more opportunities being at a more reputable program, but choose the school that you feel like you could give it all and succeed.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> One of the things I like about working in retail is all the great people I meet. Yes, some people are not very pleasant to deal with but most of the people I've met were really nice and understanding. I look at all the pharmacists and techs I work with and they have great relationships with most of the customers and that's the kind of relationship I want to have when I become a pharmacist. There was actually one lady who called today and she was all pissed because the requests were being sent to a doctor she wasn't seeing anymore and one of her prescriptions was inactivated when it wasn't supposed to be. Having worked for only 2 months, I didn't know the best way to solve the problem but I still worked through it so that at the very least, we can send the requests to the right doctor. She was really patient even when I accidentally hung up on her and was really appreciative. And while our PIC cares about the metrics, he gives us an incentive for doing something better instead of getting angry that we aren't doing things right. Everyone I work with is so great that I wouldn't wish for more than to be able to stay at this store as staff rph when I graduate.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> It may be idealistic but I like the idea that pharmacists are one of the most accessible health care professionals. I'm hesitant to go to a doctor or even an urgent care because of the costs and just the time it takes. Helping people is one of the reasons why I'm pursuing this profession. Of course, I can't deny that it hasn't turned out the way it should be, ideally where people treat pharmacists as health care professionals and not someone to show you where Christmas cards are but when I see people who have genuine questions about their medication and are appreciative of their pharmacist for answering their questions, I think it's worth it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't let all the negativity shape the way you look at pharmacy even before you start working. I'm a student and I also work at school library in addition to interning at the 3 letter. The job at  school is one of the easiest job at my school. I spend 99% of the time just sitting there and studying. But I enjoy my pharmacy job much more than the job I have at school. I learn so much, work with great people and reinforce information I learned at school. I'm constantly busy, which is good for me because it makes the time go by so fast. I love helping people on the phone, even if it's just a simple refill or checking if their prescription is ready. Yeah there's rude people who are just demanding and impatient, but they're just only a few out of all the people I get to help. We've had days where we were pages behind in production and phones calls going up to 7 or 8 pharmacy calls. I can't say the same for everyone else because I understand that we're probably an easier store and that for others this is a typical day. I'm not agreeing with all the corporate policies, but I've enjoyed my experience and I'm actually glad to be here instead of at a hospital, where I was originally shooting for (I've heard about working at hospital from my friend and it doesn't suit my personality). If you work there and absolutely hate it, at least it's an eye-opening thing that it's not for you, but don't deny the opportunity before you find out yourself.  </TEXT>

I had to ask a lot but after 2 or 3 shifts I could handle it on my own unless there were "special prompts". It was pretty much the same for production too. We were pages behind and I had to help and that's basically how I learned things.

<TEXT> The worst thing you can do is give the someone else’s medication, and there are steps to prevent that as long as you pay attention. You search for the patient’s name using first 3 letters of their first and last name and their birthday. And then when you scan it, it will tell you if it’s the wrong one, so don’t worry. Ask to shadow someone do it  for a couple of times and have them watch you at least once or twice so that you get it right. There will be a lot of things that pop up like pharmacist counselling or important things to tell the patients, so you can ask someone if you aren’t sure, even if it isn’t your trainer. Personally I just went into it without having the OJT, and I got the hang of it after doing it for a while. Don’t worry about having to ask someone because no one’s expecting you to be perfect on your first day.

Edit: understand script sync (when someone has multiple prescriptions, they can sync them so that they can pick up everything in one trip) and ready fill (we can automatically fill them without them having to call to schedule a refill) because those prompts come up a lot  </TEXT>

I had to go out of the country for about a month shortly after being hired and my pharmacist was fine with it. They say you have to work 8-10 hours on average a week, but if I have tests coming up he's fine with me working for fewer hours or if I don't have much going on, gives me around 20 hours. I guess it's really up to the pharmacist in scheduling and how busy the store/how many tech hours they have. We also get evaluated our P4 year and get hired as grad intern/pharmacist later down the road.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> \^ this. You just naturally get dehydrated as you keep talking and get bad breath as a result. At first, you want to show that you're willing to learn and grow. Ask questions and take notes on a notebook so that you won't have to ask the same questions later. I try to keep myself busy, not just standing there looking bored. Pulling drugs for production will help you learn where everything is. If you're at a busy store, you probably wouldn't have time to be bored anyway, and it can get tiring, but makes time go by fast. As for staying upbeat, just focus on customer service. Smile, try to sound positive, and not look tired. And when you're not dealing with the customers, try to get to know the other staff. Although you might be nervous, most of them are good people and it's better than just keeping to yourself especially because you'll need to ask for help a lot. You might make a mistake or two, but don't freak out, ask someone and most times it won't be a big deal. Overall, I think it's an interesting job with something to learn every day. Good luck!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Residency isn't exactly considered schooling, nevertheless you still have to do at least PGY1, maybe PGY2 depending on if you want to go into specialty or where you work at if you want to be clinical pharmacist. People call it cheap labor because you get paid much less as a resident. It's pretty much the same with doctors, they have to go through 3 years minimum. So another thing you should consider is, how soon do you want to be out? There are hospital pharmacists who don't have residency but work at hospitals. They probably do less clinical work but you don't get as much patient interaction as retail. Although with so many grads going through residencies now, it might be that you need a residency just to work in a hospital.  And I'm not saying you should slack off or anything during school, but how much effort are you willing to put into school? Would you be satisfied with just getting that degree or are you willing to work for A's, get leadership positions and build connections?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree with all those, but I wouldn't say retail is necessary a dead end. It really depends on the person, like my pharmacist has been working at 3 letter for 6-7ish years now and she enjoys it. I thought I would never go into retail, but currently being an intern there, I don't think it's a horrible path. I get why people bash on retail pharmacy a lot. It's not the most desirable path when you hear all the stories. But I think it depends on what kind of experience you have and what kind of a person you are.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me, it's just little things that customers do that make me feel better and make the work enjoyable. I'm new so sometimes it takes me a while to figure out the message on the screen or put in a new Rx. I feel bad because it takes me longer to do things that other techs do, which probably is frustrating to people who've been coming to pharmacy for a long time and have that relationship with the staff. So I'm constantly apologizing whenever I have to go find someone to ask a question or I'm having trouble. It really makes me feel better when they smile and say "no worries" or "I'm fine, take your time". Or sometimes they would say they aren't feeling well and are obviously having a bad day and I just say "I hope you feel better" and they just break into a smile and you can see that just those words made their day a little bit better.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, that's confusing, I should have made the numbers different. I'm gonna say I weighed 150 mg drug instead. 40 mg is required and 120 mg is aliquot.

So you use 150 mg drug weighed out and add diluent to produce a dilution mixture of 360 mg. You take out 120 mg aliquot from 360 mg dilution, and the 120 mg contains the 40 mg required drug. so if you have 150 mg in 360 mg dilution, the strength of the drug would be 42%. But this has too much drug (150 mg) when you only need 40 mg. So you have an amount that you take out (aliquot) that has the same strength but with the exact amount of drug you need (40 mg).

Essentially, the aliquot will have a fraction of the amount of drug you put in and the diluent.

(150 actually doesn't work out numerically because I changed it so just ignore numerical accuracy here)

Hopefully this makes sense. It's a pretty hard concept and it took a while for me to get it too.

<TEXT> Always keep your options open. I don’t know if you have any retail experience but I thought the same thing. I actually didn’t have any experience, I just listened to what people said about horrible retail experiences. Be as it may, retail job was the only internship I managed to get especially with no tech experience and I’m actually glad that I got that job because it opened my eyes to what retail is. Now that I’m more exposed to pharmacy, I think that retail may be more suited to my personality than hospital.

If you start now, you can make yourself competitive for these jobs. Make connections, get involved in pharmacy organizations, get pharmacy experience, get leadership positions. All of these are really good for getting a job somewhere. Especially connections. I’ve seen people at my school be so passionate about pharmacy and have become successful pharmacists because of all the things they did throughout school.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm going to try my best to explain this to the best of my knowledge and ability

From what I've learned, aliquots are used when you have a balance that has a minimum weighable quantity  and you need an amount that is smaller than what the balance can weigh. Basically the the LWQ is the minimum weight that can be weighed and still be accurate.

This is the shorter version, I can put the longer version if you want but just to save some space...

say that you need 40 mg of drug but the LWQ is 120 mg. You can't measure 40 mg with the balance with accuracy

1. select a number to multiply to the amount of drug that you need (this is the amount of drug you actually weigh using the balance). The total should be greater than LWQ. I usually use 3

40 mg (drug needed) x 3 = 120 mg

you can't use 2 because 40 x 2 = 80 < 120 mg, 80 can't be weighed with accuracy

2. decide on an aliquot amount, this is the portion you will take out from the total dilution to use for the prescription. I usually use the LWQ amount

so aliquot = 120 mg

3. multiply the aliquot by the multiple you chose in step 1. this is the total dilution (drug you weighed in step 1 + diluent)

120 mg x 3 = 360 mg

360 mg - 120 mg (drug you weighed out) = 240 mg diluent

4. take out the aliquot

basically you take out 120 mg of the total dilution. This should contain the needed 40 mg of drug.

We're required to write out our answer, so I would say "Mix 120 mg of drug and 240 mg of diluent. Take out 120 mg aliquot from the dilution. This aliquot should contain the required 40 mg of drug."

&#x200B;

As to how it applies to making solutions and compounding, I think that it's because the amount you generally require in the prescription isn't a big amount like 120 mg and you're probably not going to get a balance that has LWQ of say 2 or 3 mg. So you need to be able to know how to do these calculations so that you can accurately weigh out the small amount of drug you need.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a pharmacist, just a pharmacy student in US from S. Korea. Some things I've noticed was that there are no retails, majority are independent pharmacies with some hospital pharmacies. I've seen like 5 pharmacies in one building (most buildings have over 10 businesses because of small land size). One thing I liked is that pharmacists get to sit whenever they want to (probably because they own their pharmacies and can do whatever) and they don't have any prescriptions to fill other than those that patients bring in. So basically no refill prescriptions, I haven't seen doctors send in prescriptions, and everyone waits for the prescription to be filled. There's no dropping off and then coming back the day after. No drive thrus (not enough land for this). Pharmacists truly are the first line of care. If it's a minor infection and not a major illness, you don't have to go to the doctor, you can just go to the pharmacy and they'll prescribe something for you. Unlike US, pharmacists don't immunize. Insurance is really easy because there's one insurance through the government so you don't have to worry about different companies and all that.

Generally the pay is a lot lower,  it's around 40,000-70,000 in the city, maybe around 80,000-100,000 in rural areas. But at the same time, the living costs are lower. Pharmacists do have a lower status than probably in the US, but that's really debatable. Pharmacists are way more stressed in the US, and not treated as their worth especially in retail. Although I would say the path is limited in S. Korea. There's 3 major options: community, hospital or research. I don't know about residency but it didn't seem like they had any. I want to say the job outlook is better just because there aren't pharmacy schools just popping out randomly and most go for medical schools. Though with so many pharmacies around, I don't know how competition affect things. This isn't pharmacy specifically but there are over 20 restaurants on one street and at least 10 close down within 3-4 years because they don't get much business.

I'm sorry I'm not from HK and can't tell you too much about it over there. I think it would be similar just because there's a lot of population on a small piece of land but hope this is a good reference.  </TEXT>

Like I watched all the videos on steps to searching for insurance during orientation but none of that stuck in my mind. You just have to try it yourself and do it step by step. I don't know how much this will be help for you but there are some reddit posts where people have written about some important things to know. Mainly I do simpler jobs and things I know how to do when I'm with a floater or a pharmacist who doesn't know that I'm a new intern. And then if I have time I just shadow one of the techs and try to take notes on what they do. Maybe as a last resort you could contact the intern coordinator and see if you could switch stores.  </TEXT>

And if people want to go into pharmacy they have to be passionate, prepared and dedicated to accept whatever comes at them.
I also want to ask, what is your expectation? For me, in my home country, I think the average wage is around 50,000 and pharmacists don't have as much value as they do here (even though pharmacists get a lot of bs).

<TEXT> Yeah that makes sense. I don't know, I just focus on what I enjoy about pharmacy. I enjoy what I learn at school, I think they're interesting. I enjoy working at the pharmacy because I learn a lot every shift. I know that there are limited jobs out there and it'll probably be hard to get a job when I graduate. That's why I use the time I'm given to make myself marketable and competitive. Because I think that whatever field I go into, there will be competition with any decent job. It took me 2-3 years just to get an internship and I believe that it took me that long because I wasn't competitive enough. Instead of thinking of things that I can't control (like saturation), I think of how can I improve myself, how can I be appealing to these companies. Doctors are in demand, but that doesn't mean I'll apply once right after I graduate and automatically get the job. There will always be someone with more experience, more knowledge that will be competing for the same job. I think that if competition isn't avoidable, might as well work for something that I'm passionate about because I'll at least enjoy the process.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's going to be people who will tell you to get out while you can. The field's saturated, basically no room for development and you'll be miserable. I'm going to tell you that it's not necessarily a dead-end and that there is still hope. Of course other people will say that I'm just a hopeful pharmacy student who doesn't understand the real world. So you can read what I think and make the decision for yourself.

I'm only a P1 but I'm in one of those 7 year programs where basically the path to being a pharmacist is laid out for you. As a freshman until now, I've been surrounded by people who were going to be pharmacists and taken courses focused on pharmacy. So it wasn't until couple of months ago that I started having doubts. That's actually when I heard about the saturated field and naturally I was worried about my future. At the end of this year, I can get my BS and get out if I wanted to, but I plan on staying.

I recently started working as an intern (never worked as a tech before) and I enjoy it. Sure there are rough moments where I was struggling and the person didn't "give a fuck" that I was still being trained and they just wanted their meds. I know I haven't had the blunt of real customer service and it's hard to stay positive all the time. I know that it can be worse than how it is right now. But it really makes it worthwhile when I'm able to help someone or just answer a question. You could make six figures and be miserable for most of your life and a lot of people will do that. But if you truly are passionate about pharmacy, I think that it's worth pursuing. You could choose some other health career that have more positive outlook like doctor and it could be for you, or not.

I will also tell you that there are many options. Retail, hospital, clinical, specialty, industry or non-traditional pharmacist jobs like call centers. If you're trying to look for a job in a major city, you probably will have little luck. If you're willing to relocate, you'll have much better chances. I know of couple of people who were able to get a job at retail for around 120,000 right after graduation because they were willing to move. And I think the average wages of new graduates isn't typically that high.  If you're willing to put in the work and pursue a residency, go for it. Many people will tell you that it's a waste of time, but if it's in your heart's desire, I think you should do it. On the other hand, I don't believe in doing residency just to increase your chances of getting a job because you'll be miserable.

In the end, I can tell you that it'll be a paradise as a pharmacist or others can tell you it'll be hell but it's for you to decide, are you passionate enough? Often times it's passion that makes people stand out, maybe because they were interested in all these organizations that they held a leadership position, or they cared enough to try to make their workplace better. What determines your future is your journey and decisions throughout school. Yes, it may be harder to get a pharmacist job than maybe other professions. But how hard are you willing to work for it?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agree with the fact that the public doesn't know what pharmacists are capable of. I'm a pharmacy student and I thought that pharmacists only dispensed medicines before I looked more into the profession. They'll never support the pharmacists when they think that pharmacists only count pills and put them in bottles. Is it impossible? I don't think so. I think that it just takes time and a lot of effort to expose the role of pharmacists through outreach programs and just having more clinical responsibilities. And even then we might only reach maybe a fraction, and even a smaller fraction that'll truly understand. It's a very misunderstood profession  </TEXT>

My pharmacy manager put the wrong sig code and I don't know if it actually went out to the patient or if he caught it before and just left the bottle there. And I know I made one mistake with sig code (I don't know exactly what because the pharmacist didn't tell me) and it wasn't that I was worried about it, I was just curious because they didn't really do much about it other than fix the mistake and move on.  </TEXT>

Basically it seems like there's a lot more focus on chemistry and its effect on drugs. I'm guessing the courses are generally similar but the way they put it there'll be more advanced chemistry focused courses. Depending on what  final career you want to go into, you could get to MD, Pharm.D or other health care professionals either way. If you have a strong interest in chemistry, I would say go into pharmaceutical chemistry, but if you don't like chemistry (or orgo for that matter) I would suggest pharmaceutical sciences. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It's actually the same way in S. Korea. Basically, you go to the doctor, get the prescription, go to the pharmacy and get your medication. As far as I know, pharmacists don't have to worry about filling a certain amount of prescriptions per day because they don't have any to fill other than the ones people give. The whole process actually takes less than 10 minutes.  </TEXT>

Don’t look bored or stand there when you’re done with something, offer help, ask or do what you know (like putting away filled prescriptions, putting away bottles, pulling bottles). Always be the first to help the patients because you might not like doing it but the team will be appreciative. Don’t be afraid to ask because they’ll prefer that you ask than to mess up. And most of all, enjoy what you do and learn from the experience. Even if you don’t make this a lifetime career, the experiences can help you in other ways. It’s not a job for everyone, you may enjoy it or hate it. You’re still young, if it’s not for you, move on and look for something else. Good luck!  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  I finally got an internship after 3 years of searching for job/internship but my first choice was hospital pharmacy. Sure, I haven't been working long enough for the company to say I know what I'm talking about. But I'm really fortunate to have this because my friend's having trouble finding a tech job too. Days get tough and I'm drained from ringing up people at the cash register and the drive thru and patient care calls aren't my most favorite job. I might have messed up and accidentally not told a patient something couple of weeks ago and now they're pissed because they needed the medication that day. But I keep smiling and do my job because when you're positive, the customer is more likely to be more positive (not always but it worked many times for me). I am grateful for this opportunity because I learn a lot every shift, and it was a blessing after a 3 year search for jobs. At the end of the day, there might have been some unfriendly customers, but I know I made the day more positive with a smile for many others. I know that I tried my best to lighten up the workload, where otherwise, would have been only 1 pharmacist on duty. Sure it's tiring, but I focus on the positive things even if it may be just a tiny thing.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pharmacy has its own doctorate degree (Pharm.D.) but that's not a big issue. Pharmacy is kind of limited in ways that you're basically stuck in pharmacy for the majority of it. There are different areas within pharmacy like nuclear, hospital, clinical...you probably know more than I do. I guess if you like pharmacy and don't even mind the retail aspect, getting that doctorate degree may be worthwhile. It's debatable because I think the expected salary of a pharmacist is supposedly six figures, but with the job market aspect and everything, don't know if that's still the standard or not. Even so, you'd definitely be making way more than a tech. I've heard some people say they've paid the debt in 5 years, some took 8 years....I guess it really depends on how you manage your finances and what your financial situation is. It also depends on if you have a bachelor's or not, because if you don't, it'll take more than just 4 years in the pharmacy program. I would advise you to look at your area, maybe talk to some of the pharmacists you know and see what the job market is like. If there is some demand, like in a rural area, the debt could be manageable. As for your work schedule, you probably won't be able to work full time, but I've seen some people who work maybe 20ish hours as a full time pharmacy student. I can see some impact it has on the way they do in classes, but hey, as long as you pass and get that degree, who cares if it's an A or C unless you wanted to go into residency?

&#x200B;

This is all theoretical but I'll put it in terms of numbers to help you see how much of a difference it'll make (I won't include taxes because that just makes it so much more confusing)

Assuming you work 40 hours for 52 weeks, you work 2080 hours per year

2080 hours  x $22/hr = $45,760 per year

Let's say you go to school for 4 years and work around 20 hours/week

1040 hours x $22/hr = $22,880

at the end of 4 years you'll have $91,520

if you worked full time for 4 years, you would have $183,040

In 2016 chain pharmacists made around 120,000, I'll go with that

2 years past graduation, assuming you got a full time job right after, you would have total of $331,520, if you didn't go to school, you would have $274,560

Overall, you would definitely earn much more in your lifetime as a pharmacist than as a tech, and I don't see the debt as being unmanageable. I know that there are a lot of factors, especially with the fact that you can't afford to not work full time currently. In the long run, it would definitely be worth it if you're planning to stay in pharmacy. In the short run, it may be a bit harder to decide. Would it be possible for you to save up some money and maybe take a couple of years and then go to pharmacy school?

I'm sorry that this is so long and if it confused you even more (hope it didn't) and I know that this isn't perfect, but hope it gives you some sense numerically. Good luck!

It's probably the fact that the corporate keeps cutting tech hours that it's expected that the FS employees help pharmacy when needed. I agree that it's unfair for either of the departments and wish that the higher ups would consider what we go through as employees on store level. Hopefully they are appreciative of the help and just haven't had the chance to express that yet. I think the stress of a retail setting gets to us sometimes.

Working only for 3 days straight made me realize how much energy it must take for people who work everyday, doing the same things and doing things without mistake. Interacting with people who aren't as fluent in English made me realize how it must have been for people who were trying to help us when we first moved to Canada. Truly understanding pharmacy as a profession and understanding that it's more than filling prescriptions. Also learning that while we serve people, we're also customers to someone else, and that it really means to treat others as you want to be treated. I look forward to learning more and growing as a student pharmacist. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know this isn't really the main point of the post, but I just want to say, as a pharmacy employee, we really appreciate when the FS employees come help out. It's more different with my store that there's less customers in the FS generally. sometimes when I work, there's only me as the tech and the pharmacist, and I try my best but I just recently started, so I'm not familiar with a lot of things. Whenever we have a rush of people, it really helps a lot to have just someone helping out. So please know that you might not enjoy the work you have to do at the pharmacy as a FS employee, but we're really grateful for all the FS employees who come and help. Personally I want to say thank you, but when we're so busy, I just get caught up in the moment and don't even have the chance to say that before they leave.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it's that you won't be able to find a job, you just have to be flexible like willing to move or maybe take up a job at a lower salary than what you may have been expecting. The general trend seemed to be that in major cities there is oversaturation of pharmacists but if you're willing to go to a rural area, there is some demand. I could be wrong and things could have changed. For me, I like learning about medicine and while it may not be very obvious, I like how pharmacists are able to make a difference in many people's lives. While there are stories about rude and horrible patients, when I hear stories where patients were grateful to their pharmacist, I think that's worth it. I chose it because I found the job interesting and rewarding in some ways. If I absolutely can't find any job, maybe I'll have to look for other options but I love the experiences that I got to have while being a pharmacy student.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> A lot of retail pharm tech jobs are entry level so you don't have to worry about lack of experience. If you want to go to hospital pharmacy though, it would be preferable to have experience and certification. Depending on the state you live in, there is a time requirement to get certified, but you don't have to worry about getting certified at least now. A lot of pharmacies do give you a raise, even if a little bit, if you do get certified so you could certainly start getting prepared now. And like the other person said, you could at least get a foot in the door by working as a cashier or even pharmacy cashier. But considering you have customer service experience, I don't think it will be too hard getting a job at a retail pharmacy  </TEXT>

In about a year I’ll hopefully be competitive enough for a spot but it’s really competitive because there’s another pharmacy school 30 minutes away and I’m limited to places I can get to by bus or metro and near my school. I understand that residency is much more competitive than getting a job as an intern or tech but would having retail rather than hospital experience put me at a disadvantage and how much difference would it make?  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would recommend getting into pharmacy as soon as possible and build network and experience. A lot of the jobs can come from just knowing people. Retail pharmacies like cvs or Walgreens have intern programs that will hire students after graduation as graduate intern and then eventually pharmacist. May not be an ideal job but worst comes to worst it’s still a job. Another possibility is pursuing residency afterwords, though if it is really worth it or not is really up for your friend to decide but it is required for clinical pharmacists. Within school, I would recommend getting involved in pharmacy organizations like APhA, ASHP or ACCP, depending on interest.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you search around the internet you'll definitely find some on places like quizlet or reddit. Chegg has answers but you need to pay for an account so I don't know if that's worth it for you. If you're just trying to get through it, ctrl + f on pdf versions will help you find answers really fast. On the actual modules it's really annoying because it will make you review the section before retaking the quiz on some of them but if you're willing to spend some time you can try every answer/combination of answers until you get it right since you can pretty much fail however many times it takes for you to pass. I'm guessing you have to take it in store so you could probably ask other techs though I doubt anyone will really remember the answers. The pharmacist helped with mine so worth a try. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just started as an intern at CVS and within the first 3 days of working there I've seen some very rude people and while I haven't had anyone scream or yell at me yet, I've heard many stories and I know I'll encounter it some time in my career. Still being a pharmacy student that's why I'm leaning more towards hospital or clinical pharmacy along with other reasons but I do like the fact that pharmacists can build relationships with patients in community pharmacy. I always thought that I would never go into retail  when I graduate if I could help it but after seeing that I'm willing to give it a chance. It's people like you and people who really appreciate the work that pharmacy staff do that makes it worthwhile and makes me focus on the good and my desire to help people. So thank you for your understanding and the kind words  </TEXT>

<TEXT> You could try asking around to see if you can shadow people (like hospital, research, etc) and just see at first if that's really something you would be interested in choosing as your career. There also may be intern opportunities which may or may not require you to be a student. Also try looking at job postings and see if there's any position within that field that are entry level and you don't need experience for. If you have any friends or anyone you know who are in that field, it would be good to talk to them too. It may be hard trying to get into a job without any prior experience but if you look and ask around, there may be a lot of opportunities for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that professionalism is important. Dress nice, maybe not a full out suit but a nice shirt, and shoes. Ask a lot of questions, but make sure it's something you're genuinely interested in. Be attentive at all times,it would be good to be knowledgeable about the industry/company. And a follow up email to thank them for their time. You could also take notes if you wanted to, it may look good on you and show that you're really willing to learn things. It can be hard to be memorable if they have a lot of students coming through, maybe easier if you were the only person visiting. I think the best thing to do is just be on your best behavior and definitely send a follow up email  </TEXT>

<TEXT> More often than not you'll get a question like why do you want to be a pharmacist. I don't know what your reasons are but a common one is desire to help people. If that is one of your reasons, I would strongly recommend volunteering to show that you really want to help people. If you're currently attending undergrad, you could also try getting leadership positions or if there's any organizations that are medical related. I think that schools and employers really like to see that you're able to manage time well, especially with pharmacy school being tough so you could try being involved in several organizations and with your job it would look good. With your GPA I wouldn't worry as much but try to make those organizations something meaningful, not something that's just really random and are purely for entertainment, but something you could learn from and get something out of. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think that it's better to work than to not work. You already have experience so it may not be as significant to you, but I just recently started an intern job and found that I learned so much in just a couple of days. It's definitely easier memorizing drugs that you already know and are familiar with than try to memorize weird names and you have no idea what it does. Our school have different pharmacy electives like hospital pharmacy and I wish I had experience in hospital pharmacy because that course would have been so much easier.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm PY1 student and I've recently had those thoughts. So I started exploring other options like medical school and when I thought more into it, I felt like being a doctor would be more fitting for my interests than pharmacy. I recently started an pharmacy intern job at a retail pharmacy and just interviewed for another job at a hospital. I thought that I would hate retail but while it can be really busy and really demands a lot of energy, I thought that it was really interesting and I learned so much just working for a short time. That being said, I may hate it 5 or 10 years down the road but it definitely made me want to get Pharm.D and give it a chance. I know that there's a lot of concern about oversaturation, but if you really have a passion for pharmacy, and if you don't have any pharmacy job currently, try getting one preferably within first year or maybe second year. Places like CVS will hire you as intern and if you do well you will be hired as grad intern and then pharmacist (not a guarantee because things may happen). But having those experiences will definitely help you get a job. And since you'll be starting school, you have a lot of time to make yourself a competitive candidate. Get involved with pharmacy organizations at school and form a lot of networks with pharmacists  </TEXT>
