<TEXT> I went from not liking Kanye West to being genuinely concerned for him now. He is clearly having a manic episode. Don’t understand why his wife won’t step in to stop this. Even more concerning that a lot of fans of his will try and justify what he is saying (rappers included) when all he’s doing is ranting and saying pseudo intellectual bullshit. I hope he finds peace. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There’s a lot of factors that come into play. Job location and how many scribes are on staff are major factors. I work 12 hour days everyday in NYC while being exposed to COVID patients so we get a lot of charts. Patient volume is huge as well. If there is 1 scribe and 1 provider working side by side you may see 20 charts but that isn’t the case for all scribes. Like I mentioned before, there are 4-5 providers dictating to 1 scribe on average so the number will be higher. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If all scribes lost their job tomorrow yes the hospitals and clinics would still run but not as efficiently. Doctors would get swamped with charts and in some cases would even have to finish charting when they get home. It adds more to the workload when you are overworked and undervalued as a physician. I have to tell myself just because I’m not treating patients, that doesn’t make me not important. I’ve become friends with other medical staff and it has really helped to paint a different picture of what a scribe is. We don’t just sit there and play with our hands, we are people who have jobs to do as well. Don’t let people make you feel inferior or tell you what YOUR value is or what they think it should be. You’re a scribe for 8 hours a day not constantly. When people say negative things to bring you down at work, take it as a lesson to be a better staff member or medical professional when you reach the career you want to be in. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi!,

I’m okay with COVID patients around. Scribes were not allowed to see any COVID patients under any circumstances but now they are treating everyone like they have COVID. I have good PPE too (thank God). I can understand why other people would be fearful and I wouldn’t want to invalidate that. A lot of scribe sites have seen decreased staff because people are scared or live with someone who is immunocompromised. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’m sorry your site got suspended. I hope you can at least cross train at another site. I work with awesome providers who tell us how much they appreciate us. The issue comes when other staff who don’t know us just look as us as scribes and not people who show up to work everyday just like them despite COVID. We are apart of the ED team like everyone else and I always remind my staff that when morale is down. It just teaches you to be compassionate to everyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi,

Just wanted to post on here for all of you who are scribes. You are appreciated even if a provider or staff makes you feel like you aren’t. I’m a chief scribe in an ED and I know what it feels like. This job can be demeaning at times BUT we will prevail. Being with COVID patients, writing 80-170 charts in a shift AND not feeling appreciated can weigh on you. Stay strong and remember this is a short stop on a long and bright medical journey. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I’m applying for EMT school tomorrow and I’m pretty excited. I was wondering if anyone had any advice for future EMTs like myself. Im 21, live in NYC, and I’ve been working in the ER for about 3 years in a manager role. I’m afraid I might fail or become nervous during exams, in the field etc. BTW all classes are now online due to COVID until further notice🤦🏽‍♀️. Also, do you guys know any providers who started off as EMT’s since I’m on a MD track? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kobie passes
Gayle King does an interview with Lisa Leslie ( Kobe’s best friend) and asks her about the rape allegations back in 02-03.
Lisa Leslie handles it with poise despite Gayle kinda egging her on
Snoop Dogg calls Gayle a dog faced bitch afterwards and says she should’ve never put Lisa Leslie in that position
A lot of people including Snoop Dogg think that Oprah and Gayle are only trying to tarnish the legacies of black men while having friends and close coworkers who are predators too but they won’t talk about it (Harvey Weinstein etc)
People are divided and think Snoop was wrong because now Gayle is receiving death threats
Some people think Snoop was right because Gayle was wrong for what she did. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi Everyone!,

I filed my taxes with Credit Karma on the 23rd and I still haven’t gotten a notification saying my taxes were approved. Am I just being a little anxious? I know that the IRS didn’t start accepting until the 27th but I’m nervous something could be wrong. Btw I owe state taxes because my job never took any local or city tax out of my check. Can this be a reason? I’m in the process of looking for apartments so I need this money ASAP so I can move. </TEXT>

You’d be surprised how many people walk into a room while a patient is being resuscitated to ask for their results back and then get mad when you tell them to have a seat. You have a sore throat and a cough because it’s flu season not because you’re dying, You’ve had back pain for 5 years and decided to come today, you waited 2 weeks after an MVA to come to the ED...you have to wait. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Are you more concerned about the frizziness or how damaged your hair is? If your hair doesn’t curl that probably means you have heat damage. Stop flat ironing your hair as much as you do, it will damage your hair if it isn’t already. Do not detangle your hair dry, use a wide tooth comb with detangling conditioner. Separate your hair into sections and detangle it from ends to root. Make sure to moisturize your hair regularly to avoid breakage and dryness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey, I am the same way. We tend to be so comfortable in that environment I was at a point where I was “Okay” with not wanting to get better. I spoke to my therapist and she told me in a nutshell that we are basically comfortable with what we know. Try little things to separate yourself from negative and dark spaces. I’m not saying take drastic measures but do little things like instead of going towards a song that makes you cry, create a playlist for yourself that gets you into a better mood. It’s called self soothing. Also practice boundaries and self respect. If you know something or someone that is toxic, leave it alone. It will not happen overnight but you will eventually see you are making progress. Stay committed to it. Good luck!
