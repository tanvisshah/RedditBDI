<TITLE> I am looking to buy a GTI but have some questions! </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I‚Äôm in the market for a GTI but I don‚Äôt know the common issues or things to watch out for.

What are some specific things I need to ask about and look for when I‚Äôm car shopping?

How reliable is your GTI? I plan to take good care of it!

I want to buy a newer model, but any GTI works if there are less than 70k miles.

Are there any good places to look at for a good price?

Any other information and the ‚Äúscoop‚Äù on GTIs is appreciated greatly!

Thanks so much! </TEXT>

<TEXT> James by a good bit but he had 2 seasons here unlike Coutinho whose about to have 3/4 worth of a season. Both players are very similar in how their peak performances seem to be in the past for whatever reason. They are both enigmas for sure. James is less 1v1 oriented and was able to pass and affect the game better than Coutinho for us imo </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've quite literally grown up with/alongside the nationals. I was born in 99 and the Nats came to town in 05 (right when my memory starts to kick in). My dad was an Orioles fan but when baseball came back to DC he immediately became a fan and I followed suit. I still faintly remember going to games at RFK (I was 5-8 years old) and even have a foul ball from that era (my dad caught it naturally). I even remember being destroyed by Roger Clemens and the Astros (both cheaters) 14-1 in 2005 (thanks baseball reference). I went to the first ever game played at nationals park, alas not the famous walk off opening day game, but the forgotten preseason tune up game the night before. I feel i've grown up with the Nats and I feel a special connection because of that (I wonder if some of my peers feel the same way). I went to the disappointment playoff games against the Dodgers in Dodgers and Cubs which makes our title that mush sweeter. I go to multiple games every year and I'm so proud that this is my team. I would've said that even before 2019 but especially now that we've finished the fight! I got my dad tickets for the second home game to see the WS banner (the first game tickets were at the lowest $150 each) I hope I get to go to the ballpark soon! Stay healthy and go 1-0 everyday! Go Nats! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I‚Äôve been an international student of sorts in Germany (American here) and I‚Äôll share some about the major cities I spent time in!

I would recommend Aachen very highly! I went there for an exchange student program in high school and loved it so much. It‚Äôs a real gem that not many people know about. An authentic German experience with enough international presence to help you along. Kind of seems like a blend of both Berlin and Munich in terms of cleanliness, night life, (pontstra√üe) and history.(Aachener Dom) Much smaller than both Berlin and Munich though. Another plus is that it is close to Cologne and many other cities in the Rheinland.

My family lives in Hamburg and it is quite similar to Berlin but a bit less international. Parts of the city are really beautiful (Hafencity und Blankenese) and the night life of the Reeperbahn is awesome albeit risqu√©. If you‚Äôre into soccer, St. Pauli is something to see. The whole port ‚Äúvibe‚Äù of the city is very charming and the location near both the North and Baltic seas makes for a great but cold beach experience in the summer! Would recommend visiting L√ºbeck if you like marzipan!

I spent less time in Berlin than in Aachen or Hamburg but I got a feel for the city. It‚Äôs a great experience but very international. If you‚Äôve ever been to NYC it seems like that. The history in Berlin is 100% fascinating and the nightlife I can attest to being very cool. If you‚Äôre going for international then Berlin is perfect for you! If not Berlin is the least ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù city in Germany

My dream is to go to Munich (American FCB fan here) so I‚Äôll encourage you in that but I‚Äôve never been there sadly!

Viel Gl√ºck und Viel Spa√ü!

(TL;DR) Aachen: hidden gem, very german Hamburg: great vibe and nightlife, less international than berlin Berlin: International, fantastic history and night life, less ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel that if he wants to make a quick stop at Bayern like Wagner did, it could work. But considering the other signings being thrown around (Werner this year, Havertz next year) that spot on the bench will be filled up quick. If he wants an extended stay and lots of games i‚Äôd say this is a no. Saying that, I would love to see some Kruse bangers for bayern! </TEXT>

I'm about to enter higher level German so intermediate-high level books should be a nice challenge that wont be too hard.

What are some books/short stories I can read? I've looked online and the short story books like Caf√© in Berlin seem to beginner-level for me. Are there intermediate level short stories out there? Also any guides/textbook like books would be useful!

Danke! </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you really work on your accent then most people will reply in German! But if you have an obvious accent then younger people may reply in english. It depends on the person and region you‚Äôre in. In Aachen, where I was, I spoke German with almost everyone (ordering food, getting bus tickets, simple conversation etc.) but for more complicated stuff resorted to english (like when I got busted for not buying a bus ticket, i pulled the American foreigner card lol). In Berlin since its very international, or bigger cities in general you‚Äôll get more English. Good luck! Also pick German!  </TEXT>

Who knows how much better we‚Äôd be (as a club) with an FO that knows what they‚Äôre doing. Despite that, I‚Äôll take what we have even with the issues. Vamos! </TEXT>

<TEXT> 1. Ovi, Kuzy, Backy, Holtby, Oshie, Carlson, Wilson to name a few (couldn't stick to 3, gave u the essentials)
2. Backstrom. I read somewhere that he has the highest assist total since he entered the league and most people don't think he's all that good.... (not sure of the source but the point stands)
3. Not really... maybe Burakovsky though lol I don't like him too much.
4. Jakub Vrana. JAKE THE SNAKE! He's an absolute hoss! Our second leading scorer and the future!
5. Dudes and Babes (what we call each other and Ovi calls everyone babe), "not suck back to back" (ovi and oshie said those at the stanley cup parade) Wednesday frog (you'll see). Stanley Cup champion Tom Wilson.
6. Strengths: one of the best rosters in the league. Our offense is filthy. We seem to have an awesome team culture and they seem to love each other and the fans.  Weaknesses: INCONSISTENCY and our D definitely needs a boost. Recently Holtby the backup Copely have been shaky. We're on a 7 game losing streak lol
7. Rock the red babyyyyy. Won our first cup last year (duh) we've been to the Stanley cup twice (first time 1997 got swept by the Red Wings)

Hope this helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate this losing streak as much as you. I love watching the Caps win and I live on highlight repeats on youtube of the Caps winning. But even though we have lost 7 in a row. Here's the bright side.

We're still 2nd in the division!

All star break we can get some rest and work the kinks out

We went on this kind of slump last year and we all know what happened.

All this talk about firing Reirdan and not making the playoffs in nonsense.

<TEXT> For some reason when I get off the train in St. Denis one of 3 things have happened. Either, the ground is invisible, the ground is there but with no texture and carriages are drawn by invisible horses, or the ground is fine but the horses are still invisible.

Is it a game issue or an Xbox issue? (I have it on Xbox One).

Is this a problem anyone has had?

Thanks! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Especially where you said they need to change to survive you are correct. But give them time! Only one album out. After Rush‚Äôs first album they were called the Canadian Led Zeppelin and look how they turned out. Rush def had Zep as an influence and it took them a while (and adding Neil Peart ‚Äúoh yea that guy‚Äù lol) to really find their sound and become more themselves. That doesn‚Äôt man ‚ÄúWorking Man‚Äù is a bad song tho ;) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every single musical act has a corporate ‚Äúmachine‚Äù behind it with the whole goal of making money. But these 19-21 year old kids have some real talent. AOTPA was a step in the right direction in terms of musical originality (more than ‚Äúfrom the fires‚Äù) and I would like to see them depart more.

On the other hand, I do think they care about their music. There isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe man‚Äù behind them telling them to copy Zep to appeal to older audiences etc. Thats tin foil hat shit. These are kids who are jamming out right now. So what if they sound like their influences. They just put out they‚Äôre first album. They‚Äôve also been touring constantly for basically they‚Äôre whole career in the limelight. They need more time to discover their sound and depart from their influences.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sound like does not mean play the same songs. They do sound similar but that‚Äôs not a bad thing. They have original songs and lyrics. Even though they are obviously influenced by Zeppelin, they have different songs. So they aren‚Äôt a tribute band and there is a huge difference between the two that isn‚Äôt fully recognized atm.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> People have their own opinions on music, always have, always will. People like different genres, styles, sounds etc. They also think others aren‚Äôt so good.

While this is obviously a valid point, all of the hate and absolute tearing into GVF has made it kind of annoying to read things about them/invest in content that is not put out by the band. Its toxic. Even on this sub, alot of people seem to think the album is 6/10 at best and basically a Zep b-side. Some are even straight up hating on the band. There needs to be more support for the band! People post positive things but all the comments are hate etc. Like seriously? This is the GVF subreddit!

Of course theres the BS reviews like pitchfork, but if you search up GVF anywhere you get people trying to destroy them. Bad review after bad review.

Do they sound like Zep? YES! Is that bad? NO! You can‚Äôt say they sound like Led Zeppelin and then turn around and call them bad.

Even though the songs may sound similar you can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúcover band‚Äù because the songs are different! Since when did similar become the same.

In conclusion, sure you may not like GVF, so just listen to music you do like and bam problem solved. Don‚Äôt come on here and say they suck. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This exactly! I just don‚Äôt understand.

First, why people are hating on the album/the band. Like seriously? How on earth can you not like this music if you care enough about rocknroll to listen. Sure they sound like Zeppelin. Why is that a BAD thing??? Sure they‚Äôre emulating classic rock style (clothes & overall vibe)  and sound. Again, Why is that a BAD thing??? Why should classic rock be left to the past. It rocks! Everyone loves it. The music made back then is still loved and enjoyed by every generation! Why should it be left for dead!

Second, listen to the freaking album more than once. Its not just zeppelin influence. Just cause Josh sounds like Plant (have amazing voices lol) doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúboom zeppelin copy, cover band‚Äù. People who believe that really haven‚Äôt given them a chance and have let their biases take control of their opinions. They‚Äôve really taken them at face value. GVF said ‚Äúpeople ignore good music because it takes extra brain power to listen to‚Äù

Third, why do people come to this sub to hate and troll? Its actually maddening. Its all positive stuff thats posted. But the comment sections are an absolute war. Keep your hate to yourself! Just don‚Äôt listen to them then! Its that easy!


Its not really a peaceful army down here :( </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> The guys have rewritten the script for me. Being a huge fan of a lot of classic rock, GVF marks a breath of fresh air from the modern rock scene.

This may be a hot take for some, but most popular rock (21 Pilots is not rock I'm sorry) being released nowadays sounds like wannabe punk, metal, super alt mix and it just sounds cringy to me. Aside from some notable exceptions (for me Highly Suspect but I see this in them too) I just don't like it. I'm a huge fan of more riffs and melodic variety instead of just straight shred and scream. (Think Kaleo, Black Keys, Catfish & Bottlemen). I just hate that "Rock This" on spotify has GVF on the cover and is just ass the rest of the way. When I listen to GVF Pandora radio, Wolfmother and stuff that is much harder than I like comes up. There is no-one thats like GVF out there and I want that to change

I'm also into bands like Foo Fighters, Green Day, and RHCP but are they even considered modern anymore? I hear them on my local classic rock station all the time nowadays. I love these guys, but they're getting older and are becoming the new "classic rock" with huge acts like Zeppelin, Beatles, Stones, etc. being pushed even further back.

GVF are at the forefront of rock right now, and I hope the waves they are making will shake the rock world back to more classic sounds. I hope softer stuff that still rocks the house comes to the forefront in the near future.

I love the new album by the way, shit slaps.

TL;DR I don't like most rock out there and I hope GVF changes things </TEXT>

<TEXT> You're the One is really good but tbh I didn't like anthem or flower power as much as some of their other stuff. Of course that's just my taste, more a jam rock guy. Ideally I want a lot of jams and punch you in the face rock like Lover, Leaver and When the Curtain Falls. But a few songs like You're the One will spice it up and make it amazing! </TEXT>

<TEXT> There's been so much positive coming out of the world towards Greta (tonight show etc.) and they're definitely the biggest up and coming rock band. With that though, there's so much hate and trolling "blah blah copying Zeppelin blah blah". Even though they do sound like Zeppelin, I definitely think it's not a carbon copy. There are a lot of differences in how Greta sounds. If you're as obsessed as I am, you can definitely hear a cleaner more melodious sound than the more start stop sound of Zeppelin (I.e Black Dog). I think people can't see past the fact that Josh sounds like Plant and they end it right there. People just gotta let go and let good music be played! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2018-09-21 04:04:40 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I posted this in a comment but I felt the need to share this with the whole sub!

To provide some key context, this Summer I went on a mission trip in the Czech Republic. I was helping run a summer camp for middle schoolers in the town of Turnov (2 hours away from Prague). For the week we ran camp activities, taught english, and showed these kids who Jesus is for the first time. (Czech is one of the least religious countries in the world).

After the week of camp, my group went to Prague and explored a beautiful area of the city known as the castle (like the old walled in part of the city, not a single castle). I'll never forget this moment.

As we were exploring, the group stopped to sit by a statue as we came upon a view of the entire city. I was gravitated towards this and went to go look, even though my friends went to go sit. As I made my way towards the wall (where the view was), a poor street performer was singing "Hallelujah" and that struck me cause we were there on the mission because Czech is the least religious country in Europe. That was when it started.

As I walked across the square hearing that worship song, I started getting a feeling of pure joy. It got stronger and stronger the closer I got to the edge. It all came to a point when I put my hand on the wall of the castle overlooking the city. Internally, God showed me how much joy he can bring. I was in a beautiful place with all my beautiful friends. I had just spent a taxing week serving children in the name of him and he showed me all his joy at once. That is the only word to describe that feeling, he showed me all of his joy.

I felt overwhelmed with his power and just how good it felt to be in his presence. I just stood still feeling his joy. Tears almost came to my eyes. Whenever I feel down in my faith I just think back to this moment and I relearn just how good our Lord is.

Thank you for reading all of this! God bless you!

tl;dr God showed me all his joy when I was in Prague.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey man.

I get these feelings sometimes too. Even in seasons of growing in my faith. Sometimes I have the bad thoughts that "this is all just BS". When I get these feelings though, I just say no this is what I believe. I focus on the things he has brought me and how he has changed my life.

<TEXT> Also, I didn't read you're comment thoroughly until now and I've realized that I've been going about it the wrong way. I need to really pour myself into Jesus to gain this self control. One of my thoughts about my faith is that I need to trust in he who will never fail me, because if I trust myself, I may succeed but I will eventually fail. Jesus will never fail. I have been holding this from God but I need to give it to him and continue to give it to him. Seriously thank you! </TEXT>

<TEXT> All it takes is an attitude change. Sure you may fall on your face, but if you just live confidently, its so much better. Tell yourself that you're good enough and that its ok to fail sometimes. You have to pick yourself up by the boot straps and keep on going. It's not going to happen overnight either. It takes work and practice and nobody is perfect. Just keep trying and you'll get there.

<TEXT> I don‚Äôt know why but I‚Äôm sick of it. I‚Äôm going to college. I have so many amazing friends that care about me. I‚Äôm apart of so many things that bring me joy. Girls have always been a spot of bother, but things are looking up right now.

At the end of the day though, when I‚Äôm driving home alone I just feel it start to creep in. This unending feeling of being inadequate and alone. Despite that being untrue, I still think this all the time. This leads to having some very dark thoughts.

I just don‚Äôt understand it. I feel like there is something missing but, looking at my life, there really isn‚Äôt. I just want to be free from these doubts and get back to living my life.

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I know this isn't the normal dialogue after 3 points turned into 1 in the 92nd minute vs. Orlando, but I believe we have a great (good) team!

Gone are the days of signing the Marcelo's, Nyarko's, and Sam's of the league. I respect these guys, they were workhorses, but it would be very naive to say they weren't well past their primes. Signing the players that aren't good enough for other teams in the league just isn't a good business model.

Our mid-season moves last year were what we needed, Arriola is our best player imo and Stieber is good as well. Now to go with Asad (a steal), Moreno, Ousted (perfect timing, starting keeper hits the market right when Billie leaves), Brillant, and others. We have some great pieces that are YOUNG and ready to go. All this with Acosta and Birnbaum... My only complaint is Mattocks, but hey, he's faster than Mullins.

I'm excited for the season for more than just Audi field! Vamos! </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> This is an absolute sham. This is literally the reverse of what should be happening to a fanbase at anytime, much more when we are about to get a new stadium!! This is a time of optimism for the club (finally signing players worth a damn and audi field) and it really is a shame to see the fanbase I love so divided by the actions of our own FO and leaders of the SE.
It was already sad to see the bouncing stands of RFK go but now United games possibly without Barra Brava and DU...
Many screaming eagles members (including myself) are outraged at this "partnership" and stand with BB and DU. I really hope the counterparts of this deal realize what outrage they've created and things change. We're all fans and should be treated as equals. Vamos United and fight modern football!

Edit: I do believe though that we all need to be UNITED in this effort. Through pushing our beliefs on the club but also supporting it wholeheartedly, being the bigger man. I‚Äôm still going to go to the games and stuff to support my club. But I am not happy with how things are being run. (Haven‚Äôt been for a while actually but this is the latest and greatest). </TEXT>

<DATE> 2018-02-27 18:12:32 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I think we aren't, yet it's awesome to see us playing "better" without him. John was nursing his knee for pretty much the entire season before he went out to get his surgery, so that could be why his numbers were down this year. Also, without Wall's dominant presence on the offensive side of the ball, the Wiz need to move the ball more to win games. Hopefully when a full strength John comes back, he can just add to the everybody eats system that has been created in his absence. (He isn't too bad at dropping dimes himself).

tl;dr We aren't better without him.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe I‚Äôm a hopeless romantic but I would‚Äôve liked a little more of a love story involved between Jonas and Martha before he found out she was his aunt.  I know there was a backstory (last summer) and obvious romantic tension between them, but if more ‚Äúhappened‚Äù on screen and their affair went further, I would‚Äôve felt more of the despair that Jonas feels in that moment.

Obviously not going THAT far cause you know incest and such... </TEXT>

<TEXT> [There are a lot of comments that aren't looking forward to the post apocalyptic future referenced when Jonas goes to (presumably) 2052. IMO, I don't really have a problem with a post apocalyptic future plot line, but I do agree that it MUST be done right. The creators cannot rush this second season as much as we all want it. This show was the best I have ever seen and I would be crushed if this turns into a "walking dead" type. I don't think this will happen but the creators need to put as much time and thought into the second season as they did the first.] (/spoiler)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was in your position for a while and I know how it feels.

You were talking about dating people from other schools and that is actually what I am doing right now! Ask some of your friends (or their girlfriends) if they know anybody and you might get lucky! I did!

Also, just let your guard down. Literally talk to girls the best way you know how and treat them with respect. I know my own damn self is the biggest thing in my way when it comes down to relationships and I always need to tell myself to chill out and just breathe.

Go for it bro! </TEXT>

<DATE> 2017-05-09 19:44:34 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So a little background here.

There is this girl that is my friend at school who just broke up with her ex-boyfriend and she is talking to me about it. We have already been friends before, but she only recently started to text me again and she talks about how she is with the breakup etc.

The reason I ask this is because this girl has always shown signs of liking me, even when she was with her BF, and she is showing more and more signs now. I was just wondering if she is just using me as a crutch for her hard time (I have helped her with her problems before) or is she looking for something more now that she is single.

Anything helps out! Thank You!

In my experience my crush always would tease with me like she liked me but would always back out when I started to get serious. It really sucked for me and I hope this is not the case for you. Good Luck Bro! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Spoiler alert! The Water Diviner, its an Australian movie with Russell Crowe and it came out in US theaters like 3 years ago. Its a story about an Australian farmer whose 3 sons go off to fight for the British in WW1 (as Australia was still a colony). His sons fight and 2 die in the Battle of Gallipoli but the dad (Russell Crowe) goes to Turkey to then try and find them. It's an absolutely brutal movie with so much death and sadness and a lukewarm sorta happy ending. Also watching it in an empty theater with your own father adds to the emotion and sadness.  </TEXT>

<TITLE> I [17M] have a friend [17M] who Is never serious. </TITLE>
<DATE> 2017-02-22 07:37:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hey Reddit,

I know high school relationships and social life isn't that pressing but I'm asking this anyway. So I've [17M] had a friend [17M] for a very long time and he and I have been very good friends since middle school. I get the sense that even though we've talked and hung out countless times, we aren't truly that close. It's the kind of friendship that hasn't gone past the "first stage" if you will, even though we've been friends for years. We always joke around with each other and we make each other laugh a lot but we've never been serious, or ever opened up to each other. It has gotten to the point where, whenever I try to be "real" with him, he makes fun of me for it and almost shames me, and I don't think he realizes it.

A recent example of this comes in what seems to be a trivial form. I posted something meaningful about my life and feelings to my "finsta" (I know, trivial) and he straight up belittled me for it. It got to the point where he was making fun of how I explained how I felt in my post on a daily basis and I just snapped told him to shut up. As I said before I don't think he means too much harm but, it hurt my feelings. He's done this countless times where he tears me down for being "real" and I build myself up again. But the cycle continues. I've listened to a lot of my dear friends and others especially in my faith who have said to "get rid of the poisonous people in your life" and when people say that sort of thing to me, I can't help but think of this friend.

I'm not really considering breaking it off with this person, but I want to know what I can do to make this relationship more than what it is now. Any advice to get him to build on our foundation of friendship, and build a stronger, truer relationship.

Thanks for the advice!

<TEXT> I'm not sure what you're looking for like style wise but I'd say spend more on upper body (shirts, jackets, etc.) and shoes cause they are where more people focus on with your shirt being what people see and shoes being a "big deal" and spend less on pants cause they're just in between your torso and feet so just get something that matches multiple outfits (jeans, chinos adidas joggers etc.)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> They're nice but the color way looks like one of those jackets with the fuzzy inside and brown tan outside. I would go for a lighter color for stan smith's but overall 7/10! </TEXT>

<TEXT> For me (aside from wallet killing prices) is non universal shoe sizing! I'm a tentative 12 or 13 and 12.5 rarely and I mean RARELY exists, so many times I'm either stuck with slightly too big shoes or need to break in smaller ones! It's a struggle!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> There was this one time where I was with an exchange student group and the mom of one of the girls on the trip was the chaperone, and the girl that was on the trip (lets call her Jane) would always call her mom "mother". Jane would always do this, not call her mom "mom" but "mother" so the rest of us, (being mostly teenage boys) in the exchange group decided to poke fun at her. I should probably mention that Jane is adopted and that is where my eternal shame stems from. So we all took turns teasing and mocking her and I don't really remember what I said leading up to it but it ended up with me mocking her fairly nerdy/factual voice and saying "birth giver". BIRTH GIVER! She's adopted! I knew this before I said it but I guess it was one of those adolescent moments of thoughtlessness. The whole room got quiet as everyone (yes, including me) realized my mistake. So let the eternal shame begin! I said I was sorry and it was just a minor blip in an otherwise great time, but I will certainly be ashamed for the rest of my days!  </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this is going to come off as a tad strange but I had an experience a while back and I just decided "What the heck I'll ask Reddit". (By the way, this is my first post so don't be too hard on me!)

So I live in the DC area and as a teenager without a car I have used the Subway to get too and fro various locations with friends etc. So I was standing on the platform waiting for the train to arrive. As it roared past, right at the moment it reached where I was standing, I felt the strange urge to jump in front. I'm not suicidal, I've never seriously considered suicide, much less attempted it, but it was a really weird feeling. It was very much an out of body experience, and I think the feeling wasn't to commit suicide in particular, nor was it an "ooo what would happen" sort of experience if that makes any sense at all. It was somewhere in the middle and I felt very much out of my own control, with many fabrics of my being telling me, to jump in front of the train. Thankfully, I remained put and watched the train roll on by to it's eventual halt. I was shaken though, and I just thought about it the whole train ride and to this day, I think, "why in the world did I get the urge to jump?".

I've read some cool things on the phenomenon of how when people, say, stand on a high structure or building, get the strange urge to jump off. I don't want to say that my experience is the same exact thing but, I believe it to be similar. So I just wanted to ask, Has anyone experienced this same type of thing? Or even if you have any thoughts on it? What's it called? Anything helps! Thank You! </TEXT>
