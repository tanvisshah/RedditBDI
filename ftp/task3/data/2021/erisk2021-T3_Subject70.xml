<TEXT> Once upon a time, In a small Florida beach town, there was a teacher who was the worst of them all. Living on the coast we all knew how to fish. We catch lots of fish and sell them to the local seafood market and end up getting 1500$. We then proceed to buy a shitload of orbeez and bread and fill every cabinet, drawer, anytrhing that can hold them, and then cover the floor 2-3 feet thick of bread. The End.

<TEXT>  Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself. </TEXT>

<TEXT>  My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No, unfortunatly not, my mom does not have a good view of my dad and thinks he is a bad influence and will do anything to limit my time with him. He hasnt done anything wrong but just has a bad view of him. My phones fine and we got it repaired but as I got home i just cried and cried for hours. And even if i think about it it really hurts and makes me want to cry, however even if my dad send me a package my mom goes through it, for what i have no idea, and she dosent allow zoom calls. she limits all my communication with him and will go through my texts with him, so i really dont know what to do or what to look foward to. </TEXT>

Sorry for spelling and grammer, to sad to care rn

So for he past 2 weeks ive been looking forward to see my dad as he was coming from illionois because my parents are divorced. Well the 3 day weekend comes up and my dad arrives. we drive to where we are staying and then we talk until we get there. On the first day my phone overheats and gets wets so i start having a panic attack as i think my mom is going to be super pissed. So i just leave it out to dry and then it works okay just no speakers. went and got it repaired. We spend the next 2 days enjoying our time. But when the time to leave and we start. Well we arrive and im just feeling really sad and i jut am doing everything to keep from bawling. im 15. It is like months betwween every CHANCE i get to see him. So i get home and as soon as i get to my room i just start crying for 5-6 hours. Its just that i really need to spend more time with him and i just need a hug from him. And just evrything i think about it i get tears in my eyes. I don't know how to cope with this as as soon as i think when i can get a chance to see him its just so far away. I'm really depressed rn and tbh i dont know how to get out of it and it seems until i get to see him i wont. Until i see him again after christmas and i really have nothing to look forward to, when i spend time with him all my problems vanish and im much happier but when i go back a get really depressed and just cant do anything and all i want is for him to hug me again.

So for as long as I can remember I have known to have trouble keeping my emotions in check. Like I can get really easily offended, and am very touchy and if something makes me mad i blow my top.

So I started to google these things and found a disorder called ODD, or Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Now this pretty much means that I selectively will not listen to authority figures( I do this now with 1 teacher right now) and ill pretty much turn anything into an argument, have a bad temper/ get offended really fast, frequently touchy and annoyed by others, wont listen to authority figures, and I'm sometimes spiteful and vindictive. All these match what I pretty much do. I've done multiple online tests and they all say I have mild to medium ODD.

So for as long as I can remember I have known to have trouble keeping my emotions in check. Like I can get really easily offended, and am very touchy and if something makes me mad i blow my top.

So I started to google these things and found a disorder called ODD, or Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Now this pretty much means that I selectively will not listen to authority figures( I do this now with 1 teacher right now) and ill pretty much turn anything into an argument, have a bad temper/ get offended really fast, frequently touchy and annoyed by others, wont listen to authority figures, and I'm sometimes spiteful and vindictive.
