<TEXT> I think you have uncovered something important. The lyrics analysis would worth a new post, but hopefully I will have time and the mental capacity to do so.

Both Perry Smith and Dick wants a free life without responsibilities and ethical concerns. They want to be free, to live their lives the way they wanna be. (Perspective: someone says to killers)

This is also applicable when "solitary brother" does not refer to close people in solitary confinement. Solitary brothers and sisters can refer to positions in a Church hierarchy. "Will you give some morality to your life, if we beg you and cry to you (killers) to do so?"

The most confusing sentence would be "Shoot that love so we can stop to the end". I might need some time to analyze this one. This one definitely contains multiple layers of meaning.


OPH2 is so interesting. While reading, I have already suspected the connection between ICB to Free, but it seems that the relationship between ICB and other songs is more complex. I have also watched Psycho, and the conclusion I have drawn complicates things even more. OPH2 is definitely my favorite OPH. There will be a lot more to analyze in the album. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a Hong Konger,  I wish to maintain a neutral tone on this comment as far as I can.

(Abbreviation note: HK = Hong Kong)

As merely a student still studying in "high school" (higher form secondary school), I might be unable to locate an exact ideology term for China or Hong Kong. However, I believe socialism and liberalism would be inappropriate to describe the ongoing conflicts here.

Hong Kong's politics is a mess. Unlike the US, Hong Kong's focus is not on economic ideologies. Both Beijing's policy on Hong Kong and most Hong Kong parties **acquiesce on preserving the free market in Hong Kong**. The conflict between Hong Kong and China (to which I assume you mean CCP) is on the the appropriate extent of control of China towards Hong Kong, i.e. Democracy vs Authoritarianism instead.

But what many Westerners may neglect is that democracy is only the surface concern of Hong Kongers. The true conflict is between traditional Chinese political values and Hong Kong localism. HK localism is the ideology of seeking to preserve HK's **cultures** and autonomy. By HK culture, some view it as the balance between Chinese and Western culture, but others view it as mainly Western culture with chinese cultural influences. The latter would be in the majority. The preservation can be achieved by democracy without Beijing influences, as well as a **separation of economic ties between HK and China**.


By extension, the conflict is actually between **Chinese and Western core values**. Due to years of Confucianism being twisted by emperors, Chinese tend to hold the belief of 忠君愛國, which means to be loyal to the rulers while being loyal to the nation of Chinese. This leads to obedience of citizens towards CCP. China also lacks the concept of human rights. From Confucianism, Chinese has always emphasized on **collectivism towards family and nation**. Individual rights are neglected.

Then came the British to Hong Kong. The British emphasized on human rights due to the age of Enlightenment (John Locke). The acceptance of these values significantly increased when the credibility of British rule increased after 1967 riots. At that time, Britain realized that for HK to be stable enough for profit from trading, industry, etc., HKer's livelihoods should be a priority. Therefore the government made a lot of housing projects alongside with improvement in police quality and many others. There is also the political factor from the discontent of newcoming Mainlanders towards CCP. There they opposed the approaches of CCP and weakened the belief of being loyal to whatever rulers of the government. With the British also holding similar views on opposing CCP, HKers embraced the Western ideas gradually.

By late British rule, the governors started to work on future democracy of HK. The ongoing plans of improving quapity of life of citizens starting from the 1970s worked. At the same time, HKers witnessed the horrors of authoritarianism from 1989 Tiananmen Massacre. By then **many HKer had fully accepted democracy as one of their core values**, while retaining the stem of being loyal to a Chinese nation. (One Country, two systems seemed like the perfect dream. ) HKers were also very **proud of their identity of a HKer**.

From this, you can see how China does not have concepts of democracy and human rights such as freedom, while Hong Kong gradually has a strong stance on supporting these values.

However, this does not explain fully why I used the term localism instead of simply Western values. Many Hong Kongers believe that the most effective way of CCP to control Hong Kong is to first eradicate the Western cultural roots of HK. Therefore, they stood against attempts they saw as cultural and value assimilation efforts. This included the government trying to demolish Queen's Pier, or the plan of Greater Bay Area (粵港澳大灣區). Conflicts thereby occured.

The police criticisms can also be viewed as the conflicts between collectivism and localism. From the view of China, police enforcement was necessary by any extent in the sake of stability as a collective society. However in the eyes of some HKers, this is a human rights violation. Human rights cannot be violated, as this goes against the local core values and cultures. As Hong Kong cannot be assimilated, HKers had to be active against police brutality.

CCP despises Hong Kong localism, and saw it as a kind of separatist thinking. This is because CCP wants a collective stability, which means having to partially assimilate cultures and thinking, given that Hong Kong is so "rebilious".

To summarize, the conflict can be roughly described as the **conflict between Chinese collectivism and Hong Kong localism**. I hope this is accurate enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess it is my ability to apply knowledge into daily life. For me, it makes everything much more interesting, especially when I can see geological features on a bunch of "boring rocks", or in social issues where I can understand the connection between events. And then it also helps me in my academics.

But I am very reluctant on choosing the aforementioned one as my "favourite" quality of myself. It is not the trait that brings me the most amount of happiness. The trait that gives me the most amount of happiness should be my ability of seeing things in a deeper perspective. Supposedly on my better days, I can analyze songs, books and movies. I can see what subtle techniques the creators implemented in their works. I can think deeply on social issues, figuring out the reason behind diffierent events. This is what my proudest comments and posts are about (all long essays, of course). However, this trait also tortures me every day. It makes me feel too different from my peers, that I will always end up feeling isolated and disconnected. It makes me overthink on some occasions. And the more I try to analyze social issues, the more I feel frustrated and hopeless about the world. Every solution lies in destruction, and every destruction lies in solutions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everything in this video seems to connect to Howl's Moving Castle? I see the anime style. I see the shiny rhombus dancing in the sky. I see the references to conflicts and wars from the TV near the beginning.

Howl's Moving Castle is mainly about division and unity. War is the division and resentment, which leads to people such as Howl suffering. Unity begins when Sophia bonds and falls in love with Howl. The film ends with the end of the war.


If so, I will assume that the video is as follows:



From the beginning, I see an empty life without purpose. It is all work. People are rushing by, ignoring the bright and beautiful rhombuses at the sky. Meanwhile, the world is in chaos. Despite how peaceful the overall video seems to show, we see the explosion on the TV. Conflicts are merely hidden behind the scene, yet people choose not to do anything about it. They just work and continue with their empty lives. Edit: My eyes need to be fixed. There is no explosion

Perhaps this is also what the protagonist wants. Although he is intrigued by the rhombuses, he is also reluctant to follow them and let the winds pick him up to the rhombuses. Combining with the story of Howl's Moving Castle, we can deduce that the rhombuses symbolize love. He is not merely falling into love, he is pulled into love. When the protagonist finally touches one of the rhombus, it changes him, similar to what Howl's Moving Castle protraits. Yet he is shattered into a Million Pieces and falls to the Earth. This is probably a Million Pieces/ The Descent reference, while simultaneously an Icarus reference. Perhaps love destroys the protagonist, or perhaps love releases the protagonist from the dull life.

I prefer the first pessimistic one, but I believe this is not what Dan experienced. This represents the fear of Dan towards love and relationships. It might save him, but it might also destroy him. Then this theme is similar to that of Another Place music video.



I thought I am too mentally exhausted to analyze, but look. And then Survivin' sounds better to me now.


Edit: Seems like those are triangles instead of rhombuses. Are the triangles representing a hope for change again? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hong Konger (In Kowloon) here. Air pollution and smog is a major reason causing the "disappearance of the sky". It is widely believed that the air pollution is mainly from the Mainland. The Guangdong Province holds an prominent position in China's industrial development. This is why smog is particularly serious in winters here when the wind blows from the NE.  In addition, Kowloon also hosts some smaller scale industrial areas in Tseung Kwan O, Kwun Tong and To Kwa Wan. And then there is the pollution from vehicles.

With the early development of Kowloon Peninsular, you could also assume that poor urban planning would be part of the reason. Kowloon is a mess of skyscrapers that has its early development near Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui and Kwun Tong. Kowloon is not part of the CBD or major residential area of foreigners (with the exeption of Kowloon Tong). This is part of the reason why British Hong Kong payed little attention on urban planning there until the mess of 1967 riots occurred.

With poor urban planning, Kwun Tong, Mong Kok (Tai Kok Tsui), Sham Shui Po and Kowloon City are known for urban decay and poverty. Most notably, Kowloon Walled City, which ironically is the only depression in the photo here, was the most densely populated area in the world. It was only demolished starting from 1987. (Again, you could see that the year is after 1967 riots. 1967 riots is truly a turning point of Hong Kong, as British Hong Kong had only started to truly care about Hong Kong by then.) When urban decay occurs, you could assume that public transport is not done well, such that serious traffic congestion occurs. This in turn worsens pollution.

However, not all urban areas of Hong Kong are urban hells. I believe Sha Tin is one of the best developed areas in Hong Kong. Developed in the 1970s, it has decent transportation, nice views and rather good urban planning with abundant green areas. More importantly, it has quite a large amount of public estates for low income families. And on the side note , HK is very safe with very low crime rates as compared to many other cities in the world. Gang activities are quite hidden from public view until Yuen Long 721 incident exposed the suburban triads in HK. </TEXT>

<TEXT> >No problem, pollution is but a temporary thorn in the side of progress.

As ridiculous as it sounds, this is exactly what many Chinese officials believe. There is a popular saying called 「先污染，後治理」, which means "pollution first, treatment later." Many believe that environmental pollution is unavoidable on the road to prosperity of a country. Indeed on the suface view, many developed countries did pollute their land during the industrial revolution, and some had only started environmental treatment recently. In addition, some may view that sustainability is more expensive than polluting alongside with economic development. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Caution: long essay


Most arguments for and against NoFap are not wrong. Masturbating is not always a bad thing. What is bad though is the addiction to masturbation and porn. Masturbation addiction is defined by uncontrollable urges of masturbation frequently, such that daily activities are hindered. Unless you are religious, it is okay to masturbate as long as you are not addicted to it.

Personally I have participated and left the NoFap activities. What I experienced is that I felt guilty of masturbating, possibly due to the social tabooness of masturbation. Then I entered the NoFap community. From the wording of NO fap, I thought that I had to immediately quit masturbation completely. This, of course, failed. I am still a teenager at the peak of sex hormonal production, and I am very, very stressed with low motivation in many other activities, such that I failed very quickly. Then I consulted my social worker and she said that it was okay to masturbate as long as there was no interference with things I needed to do.



The BENEFITS OF NOFAP are largely debated, because the thing of masturbation decreasing confidence is NOT scientifically proven. However, there are indeed some benefits proven to be true. Initial studies show that frequent masturbation at an early age increase the risk of prostate cancer. (Masturbation as an eldery decreases the risk of prostate cancer though). The most concrete supporting point for NoFap is often neglected by the supporters though. It is the fact that NoFap is a goal setting activity, and success in it can increase the confidence of participants.

And then NoFap is often connected to eliminating porn addiction. Porn can twist a person's mindset, causing misconceptions on the topic of sex. This is also a stronger supporting point for NoFap, but from the wording, it seems that NoFap focuses on masturbation rather than porn.

NoFap is also associated with exercising for replacing "endorphin rush". This would be the easiest way to understand why people feel healthier after successful NoFap.

Other benefits include preventing the body image issues and health issues that come with excessive weigh loss from masturbation.



The DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS are, from my view, more concrete than the benefits. From my experience, you can see that NoFap might cause a misconception among people, leading them to think that their goal is to immediately eradicate masturbation. This causes them to have intense "relapses", which often lead to lower confidence. I am glad that NoFap supporters start to acknowledge this problem. This detrimental effect is not a strong supporting point as it can be prevented through realistic goal setting. Nevertheless, it is a common experience in many NoFap participants.

Then it comes to the point where I decided to quit NoFap. NoFap can often be ineffective, because addiction often underlies a problem in life. For some, it is boredom. For me, it is extreme stress and suicidal thoughts. You need to solve the existing problem that causes the addiction to be able to reduce masturbation. In my problem, masturbation actually reduces stress for me, such that I decided to quit NoFap.

Also, people who DO need serious help with excessive fapping cannot get the benefits of NoFap. NoFap seems to aim for people with hypersexuality, but hypersexuality is a serious medical concern that NoFap is unable to solve.


Here are some tips for successful NoFap:

1. Identify your underlying problem (boredom, stress, escape from pre-existing issues such as family abuse...) , and cope with it healthily simultaneously while having NoFap

2. Replace "endorphin rush' with exercising

3. Use SMART goal. Particularly, your NoFap goal should be realistic. Start with small steps, such as by reducing your weekly masturbation frequency by 1.

4. Seek medical help if you find yourself matching with the symptoms of hypersexuality

5. Reward yourself for small steps, and acknowledge that progress is NOT linear or easy. You might have relapses, and they are okay and can help you achieve your goal.


(As you can see, I am not actively against NoFap. What I want people to know is the appropriate ways of NoFap to ripe the benefits of it. This can only be achieved through analyzing facts, instead of relying on oral descriptions of the "benefits of NoFap".) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This comment is intended for replying to a comment here, but then I find that my points are mostly irrelevant to the comment. Sorry for any confusion caused, and bear in mind that I am also not American.

Change is happening too quickly for some people, that they feel left behind. For example, when people think of conservatives (in the US), I guess the image would be a white Baby Boomer clutching a gun and living in the rural area. Maybe not exactly, but at least this is how I imagine it to be. All of the above characteristics actually contribute to a fear of rapid change and the fear of not having things in control.

When you see things from a 1950s-born boomer, your mind would melt. Firstly, it is the end of the Cold War. People at the time might be motivated to work by the mindset of working against the enemy (communism). This is especially true when some of the baby boomers are teenagers at the height of the Cold War (Missile Crisis), where theoretically, their values started to consolidate. As if in a flash of a lightning, Cold War is gone. We inevitably have to collaborate with our past enemies in some ways. There is not much time to adjust, and they are left with their height-of-Cold-War values. They could only be left confused, unconvinced and angry. Then it is the rapid change from industrial-based economy to globalized economy. Our jobs are gone. Gone to China. "China is taking away our jobs!".

[Deleted paragraph about guns]

Also, the social change should be massive, as far as I know. Suddenly women are more important because all men went to war. Suddenly LGBTQ rights are more concerned. And yet they are simply "distractions" from what they are mainly concerned about. In rural areas, there is not much diversity. Why should they care about some distant issue that they cannot be able to experience deeply? And in their minds, progressives are indeed making a fuss out of nothing, because perhaps all they could see is the cops being model citizens in their areas.

Some conservatives are feeling neglected. There is no one that can acknowledge their beliefs as explicitly as Trump. Therefore, they simply cling on to Trump, ignoring other things of Trump that they are less concerned about. What they do not know is that Trump oversimplifies issues for them(, which might be in their favour too). And then there are politicians who manipulate their insecurities for economic and political gain.



For how to bridge the differences,  I believe what Reddit, and by extension, most of the Democrats, often neglects (with some plausible reasons) is that conservatives are important. By dismissing their beliefs, you actually strengthen them, because they then feel even more neglected. And the dismissal not only includes the Tumblr/Reddit "fuck conservatives", but also a dismissal in perspective.

As a Hong Kong student, I feel that the  Chinese passage 觸龍說趙太后 actually expresses this idea very well. In the story, a country (Zhao) was in the brink of annexation and subjugation, and all they could do was to ask for another powerful country's (Qi) help. Qi demanded the Zhao a hostage, and the hostage demanded was Zhao Weihou's beloved son. Weihou of course was furious on the idea of having her son being departed away and bilittled, and of course she would be more infuriated when someone said she had to sacrifice her daughter for the country. What convinced Weihou is that the hostage event would be beneficial to her son's future, as her son in some way saved the country if Weihou agreed to have his son taken for hostage.

Sorry for the nonsense, but my point is that politicians need to see their ideological enemy's perspective in order to convince them. Bluntly speaking, many already struggles to get by, and social justice or democracy is too vague for them. Then they are shoved with these issues. They turn into a massive movement and worsen their pre-existing issues. Of course they want peace from it all, and of course they would be annoyed when someone tries to convince them with a bunch of more vague ideas. Theoretically, a possible point is to connect these vague ideologies into economy. I fail to see this measure in either BLM and in HK protests, and I personally fear that this would lead to the downfall of both protests along with decades of possible social change. We lack understanding towards our opposition, and this should be the problem underlying in all social movements.


And then there is the speed of change to be considered. Feeling things to be changing too quickly can be worded into not being able to get used to new ideas. And this disconnection from progression, in my opinion, roots from confusion towards progressive ideas and, more subtly, an underlying way of thinking that is unconvinced by change. So on the surface level, we might have to slow down change to allow more time for people to accept our ideas. In a deeper level, it again comes back to my previous point of compassion.


As aforementioned, I am a Hong Kong citizen, so I guess I have a bit less right to discuss here. HK is a strange place with clashing characteristics of the Chinese and the Western world. Apparently some of the issues discussed can be reflected in HK, while some cannot. Hong Kong is also facing the "China threat", as described simultaneously by some locals and by some Americans. This threat is then mashed with conflicts on ideology democratic terms, habits, customs and whatnot. What is weird is that the supposedly more progressive side is also more reserved on immigration, especially on the "150 immigrants from China per day" issue. (This issue is mostly a myth. The quotas for immigration is definitely not full at present, but it reflects the fear of "outsiders" taking away resources, a common trait shared by some US conservatives)


(Sorry if this does not make sense. Just waiting to see how quickly I would decide to delete this comment as usual. Also there is the obligatory apology for messing up sentences and words as a non-native speaker.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Proposal of Subreddit idea:

r/CCWD , or alternatively, r/DCC (Civil Conversation with Downvotes or Downvoted Civil Conversation) (word limit exceeded, as r/DownvotedCivilConverse has 22 characters.)

Downvotes are originally intended for reporting unrelated or unhelpful content. However it has become a disagree button. Since downvotes decrease karma, it can be interpreted as a kind of invalidation which may infuriate the downvoted redditor. Also, downvotes indicate that a conversation topic is controversial. This explains why civil conversation is difficult to be produced under downvoting.

r/CCWD aims to promote civil discourse throughout Reddit. In addition, it also aims to return downvoting button as what was intended by encouraging and promoting users who remain civil under downvoted discourse.

Rules: No downvoting due to disagreement. Be civil and polite. (Since controversial issues might be involved, these rules are important to ensure a positive environment)

For privacy concerns, users might not want their usernames to be shown. Therefore, it is encouraged to ask for permission for showcasing usernames before posting content.


This is an idea I have had in mind for quite a long time. I dislike downvotes as disagreeing button, as it has the potential to discourage conversation and, to some extent, promotes echo chambers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> They are quite different from each other, but each stayed for different reasons. At first, Dick contacted Perry for using him for murder, while Perry anticipated to use the robbed money to go to Mexico. Perry was also attached to Dick for his masculinity. Then after they went to Mexico and went back to the US, they had to rely on each other to survive and find food. After that Perry had no interest in staying anymore but he had nowhere else to go. The option was to stay with Dick or to attempt suicide.

During the whole thing, they had large arguments several times. Both Perry and Dick recalled to have wanted to kill the other to eliminate evidence.

Their common traits should include being obsessed with hygiene and had an addiction to stealing.

I hope I did not mess up, as they were all from my memory. It seems that I can recall Perry's feelings more clearly. </TEXT>

<TITLE> In Cold Blood Series 4: Two Evils </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-09-06 18:01:27 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Trigger warning: existential crisis, depressing as usual for this series

&#x200B;

With the mainstream views, Two Evils is likely a comment on the game of life, that every one of us will not be purely virtuous. We are all capable of evil in some way, it is human nature. Or perhaps Two Evils is the comment on politics where we always have to vote for the lesser of two evils.

&#x200B;

‘Two’ evils refers to Perry Smith and Dick Hickock in ICD perspective. It could also mean the choice between death penalty and ‘life’ imprisonment for 15 years, though I prefer the first one.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> 3,4

This should be a technical mistake, or is it, with Dan being a perfectionist? This isn’t included in the official album lyrics, but neither is any of the quotes from movies.

Well, when I think of numbers in Bastille, I can think of two perspectives. ‘Shut my eyes and count to ten’ and the post-apocalypse time in DD album. The two are probably related, by the way. When applying post-apocalypse to Perry, this song is likely an imagination of thoughts that Perry had after he died.

&#x200B;

\> If I'm a lesser of two evils / Who's this man, who's this act I hide behind?

If Perry was indeed the lesser of two evils when putting together with Dick, then who is this person who kills four/two lovely people in cold blood? Quoting the book, ‘I didn’t want to harm the man (Mr. Clutter). I thought he was a very nice gentleman. Soft-spoken. I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat.’ Who's this man, who's this act he hid behind? Mental illness.

&#x200B;

\> There are two ways to skin tonight

Let's see whose road gets there faster

Skin can refer to removing or peeling the outer layer of an object. Applying to the lyrics, it means that there are two ways to reveal the evil and rotten core of the two people. Pessimistically, in any way, the evil will be revealed at the end, so let’s see which one would reveal it faster so that we can have it resolved quicker. Or let’s see which way we can get our selfish wants faster.

&#x200B;

\> This is a game, no wrongs, no right / Only a winner and a loser

Life is a game. Life under politics and capitalism is a game. There are no actual rights and wrongs, because every one defines them differently. There are only winners, those who achieve the American Dream, and losers, those who do not. Perry and Dick are definitely the latter category. According to this mentality of winners and losers and rights and wrongs, the two can do whatever they please.

&#x200B;

\> You and I, oh you and I / We're not that different, you and I

This lyric is what I have thought of while reading ICD. Perry was at least seemingly sympathetic and kind. What differs from me is his past. Dick’s story was even more thought-provoking. He had a decent upbringing, and only a car accident changed him to ‘evil’. Are we that different? Are we evil from the roots? One deviation from what happened at the past, and we can end up like they do. This chills me throughout the story.

&#x200B;

\> So keep looking / Just keep looking into my eyes.

Perry was often described as with a pair of sympathetic and wise eyes. It gives a positive initial image for outsiders who did not know him. Perry begs us to look at his better sides, but should we do so? Should we just judge by the appearance?

&#x200B;

\> And as the lesser of two evils, it pays to / Pays to be the nice guy sometimes

Perry payed to be the ‘nice guy’. He suffered from more ‘guilt’ than Dick did in some way. The ‘nice’ quality made Dick, his only companion at that time, despised him more. Perry was a burden to Dick—Perry was too nice. He might ‘snitch’ and spoil everything.

&#x200B;

We’re not that different, you and I.

&#x200B;

Discussion questions:

1. Does the person deemed as the lesser of two evils make the evil of the person less important?

2. Should we judge a person by his quality, or should we judge by appropriate corresponding comparison?

3. Is Perry Smith, who is commonly perceived as the lesser of two evils, actually evil?

4. Sometimes ‘evil’ qualities, such as narcissism, are actually caused by personality disorders and mental illnesses. Perry is an example of this. Should we treat/perceive ‘evil’ people with personality disorders and mental illnesses as evil?

5. Are we all evil in some way? Are humans evil in origin, or are we nice in origin? Or are we neutral in origin? (This is actually discussed in Chinese literature, with precedents of Confucianism being divided on this issue. Mencius believes that we are kind in origin and are only affected by negative influences throughout our lives. Xunzi, on the other hand, believes that we are evil in origin, such that moral education is crucial.) </TEXT>

<TITLE> In Cold Blood Series 3: Daniel in the Den </TITLE>

<TEXT> **Trigger Warning: Very depressing perspective of Perry. I wanted to cry while typing this. Hope you are feeling good right now.**

&#x200B;

Related analysis: [Bastille cult In Cold Blood intro](https://www.reddit.com/r/BastilleCult/comments/ia1ofl/in_cold_blood_series_0_introduction/)

[Daniel in the Den song discussion, an analysis that I am self-critical of](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bastille/comments/gp5aym/daily_song_discussion_46_daniel_in_the_den/frjwj4u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

According to Cambridge Dictionary, a den is a place where people secretly plan or take part in dishonest or illegal activities. Dick of In Cold Blood (which I would now refer it as ICD) was the one who planned the illegal activity of burglary and rape (He strongly desired to rape Nancy but was stopped by Perry), while both of them had committed crimes both in and outside of dens. From an ICD perspective, this song describes the mentality of Perry Smith, of how he viewed different events.

&#x200B;

This song uses the Bible story Daniel in the lions' den, which tells of how the legendary Daniel is saved from lions by the God of Israel "because I was found blameless before him”. Perry Smith probably viewed himself as a saint and looked down on everyone else. He might and might not feel guilty about his actions due to his illness. However, the prosecutors probably thought of him as ridiculously remorseless, as he chewed gums at court and laughed after hearing the announcement of his death penalty.

&#x200B;

It is reasonable for the song to use a Bible story. Although Perry was strongly against religion due to his traumatic experiences with the Salvation Army, he was also influenced by religion from Willie-Jay and sang hymns frequently.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> Moving along in a pace unknown to man / Go go go go go go / Go go go go go

\> Dreaming along in a pace you'll understand /Go go go go go go / No no no no no

~~These lyrics use intertextuality ( or something similar: We have a more accurate word in Chinese: 互文見義, which refers to the interconnection of words within the same piece of literature work.)~~ Sorry for making things complicated, so whatever. Perry moved along (meaning ‘lived’) with complicated aspirations and dreams that ‘normal’ people, including Dick, would not understand. He wanted to escape from all people and from all responsibilities. He wanted to escape from his complex mental states. In terms of his words describing his dream in his sleep, he wanted to attain the diamonds (freedom) from the tree and escape from the snake biting him (people blocking him in his life). He did not want to ‘live fast and die young’, and instead wanted a pace unknown and unique to men, to have a peaceful yet exciting life of exploring treasures and mining gold.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> And you thought the lions were bad / Well they tried to kill my brothers

He thought the prosecutors were bad because they gave capital punishment to him and his ‘brother’ Dick. Or to be more abstract, he resented the society for giving him so many disadvantages in life. Trauma, divorce, mental illness, poverty, physical pain, loneliness… The society even tried to kill his brothers and sisters. Somehow his family was doomed by the society and by ‘God’, that many of his siblings committed suicide. With reference to the pronouns used (you, my), perhaps Perry was also sympathizing with others’ terrible experiences.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> And for every king that died / Oh they would crown another

Due to his pride stemmed from his mental illness, he assumed himself as better than everyone else and was a ‘king’. However, does that matter at the end? Even if him, a king, had died, society would have another one. His existence was meaningless.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> But it's harder than you think / Telling dreams from one another

He struggled to tell his dreams (in sleep) and aspirations to others, because they were always deemed impractical and inappropriate. Yet others would think it is not that hard, because we are at least more neurologically typical.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> And felled in the night / By the ones you think you love / They will come for you

He thought he liked Dick for his masculinity. But was he actually liking him, or was he too desperately lonely? The two never seemed to match anyway. And Perry did realize that he was betrayed and used as a tool by Dick. He did not actually want to kill the Clutters anyway—he was forced by Dick to the situation. Given how sensitive Perry was, he knew that Dick disliked him and was only forced together because Perry was a tool to his plans. At the end, Perry only got punished because Dick ‘snitched’. Alternatively, the lyrics refer to the remnants of hope towards the society of Perry, but was still eventually crushed by reality again. Now the society is prosecuting him again and coming for him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> Dreaming along in a pace you'll understand / Go go go go go go / No no no no no.

Well technically, his aspirations were also understandable. He just wanted to be treated fairly and attain the American Dream like the Clutters successfully did. His slow pace was also understandable, because he wanted to avoid what was in the future (Go and no). Yet many others failed to understand him, because they refused to understand him. ‘Why should we care about a murderer anyway?’

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\> Oh to see / What it means to be free / Of the shackles and the dreams / That you claim to see

He wanted to be free from his struggles, and he was actually quite excited by the idea that he could leave the cruel world through death and suicide. He wanted to be free of the shadow and shackle of the past, of the abnormally cruel dreams of yellow birds crushing his enemies, and of suicidal thoughts. Basically he wanted to live what others typically should live. This was perhaps also a self-reflection for Dan to be more gratified, and was to give some sympathy to Perry and other people suffering from mental illness.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, according to the Cambridge Dictionary, a den is also a room in a home that is used esp. for reading and watching television, or alternatively, a comfortable place. This leads to the idea that the song was dedicated to Perry in the second female cell at the Meiers’ (the undersheriff’s) house. Therefore, this was also a realization that freedom, no matter the physical freedom of movement or the abstract freedom from adversity, was important to Perry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a person with mildly controversial views, I can imagine what it feels like to be downvoted. It might be belittling and discouraging sometimes. But it is okay to be upset at  downvotes, because we are humans and we seek to be validated. You do not have to "control" your emotions, but instead should keep peace with it by different coping methods despite how difficult it actually is.

Answering your questions, I also get my sensitivity attacked whenever I get downvoted. I have been struggling mentally (with insufficient symptoms to be diagnosed as depression) since I was young. I always felt different from my peers, no matter the interests, personalities or other aspects. Therefore when I am downvoted, I am reminded (wrongly) that I would always be unpopular and controversial. This happens despite that I know it is a mental distortion, because why would I know about the future? Why should I define myself with downvotes? I can define myself with positive traits such as being sensitive to other's emotional needs.

From your words, my advice would be to join more interest and niche subreddits rather than the popular and toxic ones. Is it correct to say that you wish to challenge people's echo chambers? If so, you might want to challenge them only when you are feeling good. Or perhaps you can look at r/changemyview  . Sorry if my assumption is wrong, I tend to project myself too much on other people.

Alternatively, you might want to limit your Reddit screen time. Social media is fun but is too judging sometimes. I am not saying that you should quit Reddit, but I think you can develop another interest to divert your attention from Reddit occasionally. I hope this method is helpful to you. Sometimes it might feel hard, but due to activation paradox, we actually get the motivation for our interests after we force ourselves to start an activity.

Finally, I would always recommend therapy to others. It is not a service for the "mentally ill" or whatever, but instead is  service that everyone needs in order to solve their problems.

(By the way, despite what Reddit and some other social media would tell you, being a moderate/conservative/whatever stance is okay. I always respect people who are able to converse civilly even if they are not on my side (which is left lean and liberal leaning if relevant) And sometimes the "stances" are misinterpreted due to inaccurate wordings, with the possible reasons of being a foreigner/rural citizen. Also, sorry for typing such a long comment.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Analysis of the sad quality of the 4 songs (Power, The Currents, Warmth, The Silence). I will refrain from commenting and weighing them against one another, so as to make your vote as YOUR OWN vote.


**Power and The Currents**

I personally treat Power and The Currents as similar songs. I sometimes treat them as one song and mix them together as well.

I know you may not like it, but bringing politics into account is unavoidable here.

>Introducing ‘The Currents’, he took the opportunity to bash Donald Trump  – as he had the night prior in Reading. “This song is dedicated to a giant American orange baby child,” he snarked, before adding, “Actually that’s an insult to children and babies.”

These two songs are definitely relatable and easy to understand. Sometimes politicians would say bizarre things and do not realize the impact of their words. Then things go wild, and injustice might occur. Bastille is strongly anti-Trump and anti-brexit, so you can know who Dan is referring to. Of course, everything is upon your interpretation. Nevertheless, it is depressing to see people being hurt by other's words and actions. It is worse that some politicians who are supposedly models for the public, are acting maliciously. The other interpretation of Power about betrayal is equally depressing. The ones we love hurt us most easily, and this fact seems to lead us thinking that we should isolate ourselves instead.


**Warmth**

We only need warmth when there is coldness. Sometimes when we are trying to escape from the harsh reality with help of escapism (through people in this case), the contrast of the (metaphorical) warmth highlights the coldeness. We may be soothed by our close acquaintances, but our minds may still overthink. "Some people do not have others to take comfort in, so are my struggles invalid?" Warmth expressed this feeling subtly with the following lyrics:

>Hold me in this wild, wild, world
'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be
And in your heat I feel how cold it can get

Aside from the lyrics, you might also view Warmth as depressing in terms of instrumentals. The drums in the album might make the song more upbeat, creating the "deafen me with music" imagery. Meanwhile, you might view the Capitol version as bittersweet, enhancing the message that the narrator is actually struggling.



**The Silence**

The Silence is a concerned person encouraging a close person struggling with mental illness to open up. Sharing our burdens with others is helpful at least in the long term, but it is never easy. In the lyrics, you can actually see a connection to The Currents by what I call the "water/fire core element".

>We used to swim in your stories
And be pulled out by their tide
Choking on the words
And drowning with no air inside


Water represents distance and mental struggles. Despite the narrator knows that by listening, they will be painful as well due to empathy. However, they are still willing sacrifice for their close one.

>If you give it a name, then it's already won
What you good for? What you good for?

I view this as the other person's inner negative voices. Perhaps the narrator is a psychiatrist trying to give a diagnosis (name to the illness). The other person deep down knows that they do have a mental condition. A diagnosis seems to invalidate their previous efforts, even if it does not actually change anything except helping you by medication/therapy. Or perhaps the other person is already diagnosed. To them, the label of the mental illness seems permanent. For example, depression would sound like it is unrecoverable from it with regards to people's general interpretation. Being given the illness a name seems to signify that their demons have won. This inner voice repeats itself, persists in one's mind, and grows stronger overtime, attempting to cover the concerned voices. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The technology theory is interesting and possible, though I wouldn't say that it is very likely. It is indeed true that WW starts to talk about the influences of technology, but it is not the very main theme. The important supporting point of your theory is that WW is based on 1984, a novel where technology plays importance in surveillance. References to the technology perspective could be subtly put within the album, much like in reality technology has subtly invaded our lives even if you do not use a phone. If so, this reference to technology is quite good.

However concerning only on Good Grief, I could not find a perfect explanation as to why technology is detrimental to pulling away from grief. There is no connection between In Cold Blood and technology, neither in the romance or in the novel as a whole. It also seems that there is a lack of evidence for this theory in the video and in the lyrics. Technology is involved in the phone and TV, but they are not intensifying grief. (Or perhaps the phone is? Arrrr)


You are definitely correct on fire=passion, though I am too lazy to add it again. The very important evidence of this theory is in the Send Them Off! video, where people are kissing in the flames, representing lust (When I Watch the World Burn?). Mental illnesses tend to lead to self-isolation, which is why water is also symbolizing distance. (We use to swim in your stories and be pulled down by their tide, or drowning in BB MV). I have definitely overlooked Doom Days. I should listen to it more often, but I haven't bought the CD and I am very picky on the sound quality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> By any trustworthy and reliable sources, every type would have some suicidal cases, no matter how small it is. Grouping several personality types together and claim that they have 0% is impossible in real life, and likely indicate a small number of respondents. An ideal pie chart would also list the number of people in each sector to increase its reliability.

It is also notable that MBTI is in no means an accurate personality description. To simplify a bit, it ignores the difference between 53% Introvert and 100% Introvert. The parameters are also subjective and rely on a person's honesty and knowledge about oneself. It also relies on the quality of the test. It is unlikely that everyone involved in this chart uses the same set of questions, unless it is subjectively determined by outsiders.

However, I still believe that INFP is indeed at the highest risk of being suicidal. (Generalization alert ahead)  Introverts (I) are more likely to be misunderstood, as society structures and occupations favour extroverts. Focusing on reality (S) likely means that overthinking is less likely to happen unless there is a mental condition. Being more logical (T) means that overthinking might be more easily challenged. Rules and deadlines are ubiquitous, such that society favours (J) type rather than (P) type. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cleaning up negative subscriptions is the first crucial step, but the overall effectiveness depends on the reason why you are feeling upset.

The greatest resistance to getting rid of negative subs is that they are "informative" and "important". You are "guilty" for being "ignorant" if you leave the subreddit. It is true that we should keep informed about politics, because eventually it will affect us and kick us in the ass if you are unaware. HOWEVER, excessive negative information would only make you feel drained of empathy, feeling even less need to participate in politics. Do you really need to look over every brutality video, when you already that it is happening, and it will not affect your decision-making anymore? What is the use of looking at this particular subreddit? Does this spark joy? Is this actually extremely important?

Subs that I dislike: Public freakout (actual or not), echo chamber political subreddits (no contribution to your life, makes you angrier)


Then there are other problems concerning social media, and there should be different solutions to them.


1. Procrastination due to fascinating distractions on social media

I recommend using mobile phone usage restriction apps for this if social media really sparks joy. Forest is my favorite one. You need a reward system for concentrating on work(not only finishing work) If social media truly sparks joy yet you cannot establish a reward system, you will find yourself reinstalling apps. However, procrastination has other causes such as perfectionism, and they will be unrelated to social media.


2. Negative values on social media (Everyone except me is beautiful, Others have perfect lives)

Get off Instagram, Facebook and Tik Tok immediately. People on Reddit, Tumblr and Twitter are mostly ranting on how their lives suck, so you will likely be fine. You need to pay attention to eliminatimg negative subscriptions though.


3.  Social media addiction as a surface problem. You have addiction WITHIN your social media pages, or you have problems that you wish to ignore in your real life.

This one is tricky. For the second one, I could only recommend therapy. For the first one, I believe porn addiction would be the most prevalent. I definitely would never recommend NoFap, and I know this opinion would be controversial. If you are hypersexual, NoFap is useless and what you need is medication and therapy. If you only fap to relax and the activity or the urges does not affect your daily activities, you are fine (Actual advice received from therapist). Note that addiction is often an escapement from an underlying problem, so you need to solve that problem in order to solve addiction. So in every way here, deleting social media is useless. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yay I have something to contribute.

While I am looking at the Good Grief MV, I noticed the reoccurring symbol, which is somewhat like a cross inside a square and is somewhat like the hazard warning for harmful/irritant in chemistry. This symbol is repeatedly shown next to the keypad of the telephone booth.

Good Grief is a mixture of scenes shown at the first part of the video, so there will be a lot of reoccurring symbols and scenes.

With so many water and drowning, the idea that water/fire is a core element of Bastille videos and songs makes sense. Water represents internal struggles (like drowning in our tears, caught up in the currents and waves), while fire has multiple meanings, including total destruction (burning teddy bear). </TEXT>

<TEXT> I rate songs and albums mainly by instrumentals and theme/lyrics. Songs that impress me in only one the category include No Angels (Brilliant instrumentals and atmosphere) and Blame (brilliant lyrics and quadruple themes).

For me, OPH4 is not as impressive as OPH2(my favourite) or OPH3. Perhaps at a similar level with OPH1. Both OPH1 and OPH4 have 1 song that impress me a lot, while the other songs are okay. I personally love Falling and the Descent.

The theme of OPH4 mainly serves as a transition from the troubles of Wild World to escapism of Doom Days. Wild World(intro) and Warmth(outro) did quite a good job at that. The two songs also sound nice to me. However, a lot of the songs on OPH4 are about relationships, which admittedly I am not a fan. I am frankly surprised by the popularity of Would I Lie to You. The instrumentals are also not my style. Nevertheless, the red-green idea of mixing the good and the bad is excellent, though it might be unfriendly to people with visual impairs (?) . Combining all of these factors, I am not impressed yet not disappointed by OPH4. My opinion will change if there are future analysis done on the songs.

But seriously, OPH is a way Bastille experiments, so I would not judge OPHs harshly. Even of it is not my style, I would swallow everything Bastille. </TEXT>

<TITLE> In Cold Blood series 2: Blame </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-08-25 20:21:31 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>   \> Being brought up in one way, and try to see it another way, is very difficult

From the quote, we can then determine that Blame perhaps is connected to In Cold Blood. From my theory, Blame is a flashback of events, explaining why Perry has to be executed, what his thought processing was, leading to Kansas Penitentiary’s criticism of Perry Smith and Hickock Dick.

&#x200B;

[Blame](https://youtu.be/Iys9IHmDJ1w)

&#x200B;

\> What can everyone do? Praise and blame. This is human virtue. This is human madness. (Friedrich Nietzsche, German)

 Friedrich Nietzsche was a philosopher who \*\*criticized\*\* religion (mentioned in ‘cult’ perspective of Blame), anti-Semitism and nationalism (mentioned in WWCOMMS logo and the political perspective of Blame), though his ideas were later twisted into Nazi ideas by his sister. This quote may refer to the praise (eg. Hymns) and blame (eg. Blaming satan) ritual of religions. These actions are very common among humans (virtue), but is inappropriate in Nietzsche’s eyes.

However, we are not interpreting these perspectives today. We are focusing on the surface meaning. In some way, excessive praise and blame resulted in Perry’s behaviour. He praised Willie-Jay, which might be slightly good, and blamed his abusers in the past as well as society for his murder tendencies. This summarizes the thoughts of Perry’s sister to Perry in a letter (which I failed to find in the book as I am writing).

&#x200B;

\> You go sleep with the fishes / There’s no room for you here (repetition) / Wrap your teeth around the pavement

 The mainstream analysis is that the sentences describe a murder committed by a gang. This theory can be applied in In Cold Blood theory here. Perry has joined a San Francisco gang at a very early age. Nevertheless, the murder element can be applied throughout In Cold Blood. I wish to focus on ‘there’s no room for you here’. This sentence signifies intolerance and pure hatred to the murdered victim, while repetition heightened the importance of the sentence. Perry Smith would misinterpret victims as an abuser, so it explains why Perry was so hateful towards random people of to-be-victims.

&#x200B;

\> ‘Cause your body’s a message, send my regards to hell

 The message is that Perry Smith is not to be messed with. Send my regards mean that the narrator is reminded of the recipient when something in connection to them appears. Therefore, the later sentence is used to say that the subject in which the narrator is talking about will go to hell. Simultaneously, regard means respect, and this lyric can mean that he respects hell rather than heaven, signifying the twisted morality of Perry Smith.

&#x200B;

\> (To the victim) Fall upon your knees, sing ‘this is my body and soul here.’ Crawl and beg and plead, sing ‘you’ve got the power and control here’. Don’t pin it all on me!

Alternatively: (To the victim) Fall upon your knees and look at me while you die. Your body and soul belong to death and hell. You got the control by abusing me in the past, now admit that I get the control now. Don’t blame me- this is all your fault!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6pdm8gehx6j51.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb47dd7bcaf0ab8067edc45b84f41d9fa4987aaa

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 Now we can switch to another In Cold Blood perspective of Blame, which I imagine is a dialogue of a prosecutor towards Perry Smith. Note that you can still apply the murderer perspective to the following lyrics, while the above lyrics is also applicable with the prosecutor perspective.

&#x200B;

\> You’ve been granted three wishes / Say goodbye to your mother, your father, your son

Perry has always resented his family’s living members—one of his sisters, father and mother. He might have wished for them to be killed and say goodbye to them. But the irony is that Perry is determined to be executed—his wish is indeed granted, but only the ones who are alive and dead are switched. Perry did not have a son, but he could not get a son now anyway since he would be dead.

&#x200B;

\> (To Perry) Fall upon your knees, sing ‘this is my body and soul here.’ Crawl and beg and plead, sing ‘you’ve got the power and control here’. Don’t pin it all on me!

 On one hand, you can interpret this lyric similarly to the above one. Fall upon your knees (reduction of power) and look at me while you die. Your body and soul belong to death and hell. You got the control by killing four members of the Clutters in cold blood, now admit that I get the control now. Don’t blame me- this is all your fault!

&#x200B;

On the other hand, the same lyrics can reflect Perry’s psychology as viewed by the prosecutors. Perry seeks to get some control to his chaotic life by killing his (misinterpreted) abusers. He is addicted to murder, power and control now. Perry’s mind is now irreversible, and he is too dangerous to be left alive. Perry is the one at fault of death penalty.

&#x200B;

\> Oh Blame, blame, blame… (I got you, I got you)

 Blame has gotten into Perry’s mindset. Perry is always alone. Only blame can support him forever. Now justice has delivered to Perry (in terms of death penalty) and is rewarded to the Clutters.

&#x200B;

 I am now ending by partly quoting the top comment on Youtube: Do not worship the pansexual salad bowl mouth. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> TRIGGER WARNING: mention of death, death penalty and mental health crisis

 There has been abundant analysis on this song. However, I also wish to add some more discussion topics as well as analysis on the details. Some of these have been discussed before in other places (i.e. daily song discussion and previous cult analysis), but I wish to integrate my every piece of analysis into this post for easier reading. Since I have less original ideas here, I have considered combining this post with the introduction. However, my introduction is way longer than I expected, that combining the two would make the post uncomfortably long.



 Four Walls discusses the life of Perry Smith on death row prison, his execution as well as Dan’s stance to death penalty. As mentioned before, this prison is not his first imprisonment. He had imprisoned 2 times before. However, this imprisonment was the most uncomfortable one. As the lyrics of Four Walls described, the cell was small, ‘one floor to sleep upon and only’. Death row inmates were not given a working schedule, such that Perry had nothing to do and slept all day. The cell only had a tiny window situated at a high position, such that all Perry could see was the sky and clouds passing by. Rhetorically speaking, he also had ‘no view from the cell’ and watched ‘clouds passing by’. He had no more future, as he was destined to die by execution. He could only see inmates and visitors passing by his cell and his life. He could only see imaginary opportunities laid out for him to pass by and perish.

&#x200B;

 ‘Suppose to save you from yourself’ refers to his prison did not have anything for him to harm himself. He repeatedly had suicide ideation before, as he would rather die in his own hands than in the hands of a stranger. ‘Suppose’ hinted a doubt. There is still a way for Perry to attempt suicide, which is the refusal of eating. He almost succeeded, but he eventually changed his mind. Saving Perry from himself may also refer to not letting him to indulge in further crime, murder and the guilt.

&#x200B;

As for the chorus and pre-chorus:

\> And now we're faced with two wrongs. Now we're faced with two wrongs

I don't know, oh, I don't know.

&#x200B;

This shows that Dan has a conflict on whether death penalty should be adopted. On one hand, it seems very unfair for the Clutter victims if the court were to pose a milder punishment such as imprisonment or sending to a mental health centre. The victims had suffered from prolonged suffering, as the murderers searched through the house for a safe before deciding to shoot the victims. Bobby Rupp had taken a huge blow of grief. Bonnie Clutter’s mental health state was unexpectedly improving before the killing. Note that life imprisonment was not plausible in Kansas at that time. The murders might only get 15 years of imprisonment. It is difficult for the Clutters to give mercy to the murderers. On the other hand, isn’t it wrong to punish the murderers because of their mental illness- driven crimes? It is also a bit ironic that we tell people to stop murdering others by murdering others ourselves.

&#x200B;

\> We could be born to anything and now, and now. What you have done is terrible

And now you, and now you. Now you carry it with you. You carry it with you. You carry it with you

&#x200B;

I imagine the narrator to be stuttering due to not being able to tell a harsh truth out loud. ‘And now’ and ‘And now you’ are not complete sentences. He acknowledges that the murder is terrible and cold-blooded, as reflected in Good Grief. However, he also has sympathy to Perry, as he had to bear the weight of living, bearing guilt with his remaining conscience. This would not make sense to people that have not read In Cold Blood. Despite that Perry Smith was the main murderer, he was also unusually sympathetic. Ignoring Dick’s opposition, he had helped a hitchhiker along one of their road trip. He placed a mattress box for Mr. Clutter’s comfort and stopped Dick from raping Nancy. However, is this enough for people to raise sympathy to a murderer? Is this correct to do so? I shall leave this question to you.

&#x200B;

I also wish to analyze some word painting used in the song. As mentioned before, ‘to keep you from the Sun’ had a rising and falling melody, corresponding to sunrise and sunset. ‘In Cold Blood hang you up’ had a rising melody, creating a image of hanging someone UP. There is also a new detail that I have noticed. From [1:50 onwards](https://youtu.be/IBum4BroMKU?t=109), you could hear something similar to a maraca, first a few definite percussion, then a low shuffle. I would imagine it as Perry’s metal chain on his hands dragging along the floor.

&#x200B;

 Finally, I wish to analyze the mention of in cold blood, as well as the title Four Walls (Ballad of Perry Smith). ‘In cold blood hang you up’ is a deliberate reference to the title of the novel In Cold Blood. It also shows Dan’s interpretation towards this title-- It not only hints that the Clutter murder is done in cold blood (extremely cruelly and showed no emotion, which is quite true), but also that the execution is cold blooded. Quoting a conversation from the book,

\> Person 1: Perry Smith. My God, he’s had such a rotten life…

\> Person 2: Many a man can match sob stories with that little bastard. Me included.

Maybe I drink too much, but I sure as hell never killed four people in cold blood.

\> Person 1: Yeah, and how about hanging the bastard? That’s pretty goddamn cold-blooded too.

&#x200B;

This interpretation makes sense as well, as Capote, the author, has admitted that he was against death penalty after writing the book.

&#x200B;

In addition, as mentioned before, this song is closely related to [Ballad of Reading Gaol by Oscar Wilde](https://poets.org/poem/ballad-reading-gaol) as well.  I strongly encourage you to read this poem if you have time, as it was beautifully written and was related to future analysis.

\> And at every careless cloud that passed / In happy freedom by

\> I never saw a man who looked / With such a wistful eye / Upon that little tent of blue / Which prisoners call the sky, / And at every drifting cloud that went / With sails of silver by.

&#x200B;

 Finally, the quote of Kansas Penitentiary can also be analysed.

\> Being brought up in one way, and try to see another way, is very difficult.

&#x200B;

 Perry Smith had a terrible upbringing. He had a pro-spanking father who spanked him at a too early age, which resulted in problems concerning brain development. His parents were divorced due to conflicts on use of alcohol. Then Perry went into his mother’s care, who ignored him and sent him to different asylums. There he was almost killed and was humiliated. He gradually developed a hatred of his mother and, to a smaller extent, of the world. This quote hints that the narrator of the quote believes Perry’s cruel acts are due to nurture instead of nature.

  In addition, Perry’s father taught him to use violence to solve problems and conflicts, and therefore Perry used violence to punish others as revenge. He beat up bullies at school. His murders were mostly due to a mental illness that made him misinterpret to-be-victims as his abusers, therefore killing them in cold blood.  Nevertheless, the use of ‘very difficult’ insinuates that the Kansas Penitentiary felt defeated and frustrated, therefore believing that more rehabilitation is impossible to reverse Perry’s anti-social tendencies, leading to Perry’s execution.

&#x200B;

 On the album, there are no stops between Four Walls and Blame, which means that the quote is the only thing that separates Four Walls and Blame. This can mean that the quote is applicable to both Four Walls and Blame.

&#x200B;

DISCUSSION TOPICS:

1. Do you have a strong opinion on death penalty? If so, what is your stance and why do you choose this stance? (Possible perspectives: justice towards victims, morality, effectiveness of stopping crimes, seriousness of crimes, etc.) </TEXT>

The Anchor is also depressing because the drums at the end might mean that the narrator is still suffering from a mess of mental issues, including anxiety (This is your racing heart). When this is put at the end, perhaps the narrator is actually unable to escape from their minds, hence using more partying to escape in Doom Days. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You are free to choose either of them. I am now briefly presenting the depressing parts of both songs.

 **Oil on Water** has a very melancholic atmosphere of minor tonality while also having depressing lyrics. Although Bastille did not explicitly say their stance, the band did show different perspectives towards prostitution. "Daddy, I didn't have sex" and "Someone's daughter" hinted that prostitution has the destructive power towards family relations, that the main character had to hide her occupation from her father. Prostitution is often frown upon due to morality reasons, but the truth is that many sex workers are forced to go on this path. "It's a catalogue of modern mistakes." shows that poverty and inequality is the underlying factor of the appearance of sex work. Many sex workers have to cope with poverty while being humiliated due to gender inequality and stereotyping.


  **The Anchor** is in major key, perhaps insinuating the narrator's gratitude towards the anchor. The depressing part is mainly the dialogue of drug abuse at the start of the song. A person needs anchors to their brains the most only when they are facing hardship, especially mental ones.

- "What do you know about it?"
- "Well, you gonna tell me..."
- "Why, I can't tell you. You don't - you can't - you can't explain now what's going on in your brain. You can't tell somebody how - wha-what's happening, what's going on in your- I can't."
- "Why don't you just try?"

The drug user is stammering either due to effects of drugs or nervousness/anxiety. The drug user's words hint that mental illnesses and drug abuse are such taboo topics, that they have to keep their struggles to themselves, hence also using more drugs to escape from their brains. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe Hong Kong's situation is better than Reddit expects, and worse than Asians (excluding Taiwanese) would think. Hong Kong is not in Internet lockdown, unlike the Mainland where access to Reddit has to be done with VPN. There are speculations that some pro-protester websites (eg. LIHKG) would be shut down, but that has not happened. Apple News, the famous pro-protester news denounced by officials to be "propganda", has its founder arrested, claiming due to foreigb connections. We are allowed to shout most anti-CCP slogans except the one that mentions revolution. Like most places, protests are blocked by social distancing regulations.

Agreed on bootlicking. Bootlicker is basically a derogatory term for a person praising a person of higher position. Propaganda is basically education and advertising in a negative light. Let us ignore the meaning of thought processing, because how can you know a person is thinking deeply or not? Education on non-political sectors like maths can be spoonfeeding anyway. Some do not even post their real and accurate opinions online. Calling others bootlickers influenced by propaganda is meaningless. It is an emotional release that has a potential of igniting negative emotions, and that's it. Angry people shouting words that anger people.

I also hope that things get better for you over there. I do not know where you are, but I guess most places are suffering rather than celebrating now. Hope that the pandemic would end over your place, and hope that loots, violent clashes and police violence are not happening over your area. Take care of your mental health and your physical health. </TEXT>

1. Every person's opinion actually correspond to the subs that they participate in. If you haven't experienced sexism, perhaps sexism is less rampant in your sub.

2. People who disagree with the above comment by forest may not be sexists. See above point. There will be some sexists though, which is why "may"is used. Diversion is somewhat a common technique among hate groups, though many people use it unintentionally.

3. Exceptions are just exceptions. You can interpret this from both sides. Which subs are the exceptions? Anyway, have you participated deeply in a large number of subreddits, such that you can conclude your experience is the experience for the whole of Reddit? This is the problem with OP's question.

4. Sexism can include both misogyny and misandry, depending on where the word is used. The existence of misandry does not disprove the existence of misogyny. Similarly, the existence of misogyny does not disprove the existence of misandry.

5. Some women who "hate men" are actually rants with inaccurate wordings that correspond to their experiences of sexism. A similar situation goes to men sometimes. Notice the words "some" and "sometimes". I will not include ALL experiences, since it is impossible.

6. I appreciate those who ask about people's own experiences on this thread. Give yourself a hug. This is what the Internet should be about, or activism should be about.

7. YOUR OPINION IS VALID. DON'T LET DOWNVOTES INVALIDE YOU. However, it is always good to eliminate hateful comments (hateful can be interpreted in many different ways though). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Exactly. People would slam me down as a bootlicker and a right-wing idiot for saying my quite objectively moderate political stance. Then perhaps I am a homophobe and a racist, or perhaps a dumb Republican and Trump supporter.


I am a Hong Konger / Chinese Hong Konger / whatever identity you prefer. I am also gay. This does not mean that a gay person or a POC cannot be hateful. It is just that I have entirely different experiences with police or race. It is true that Hong Kong has the police gone worse significantly last year, but the police has established such a great reputation in the 2000s, that most of us have remnants of respect towards the police. Not to mention the worst periods of Hong Kong is still 10 times better than a normal US in terms of racism or police violence.

<TEXT> On a post where people complain about downvoting, downvoting still occurs. The irony.

But seriously, I have actually held a similar position on death penalty before. It sometimes seemed true that violence can be a last resort in the justice system. However I unexpectedly changed my opinion after reading In Cold Blood. I strongly recommend you to read it. The book contains both arguments for and against death penalty. Perhaps it may also change your opinion on the entire incarceration system too.

On this thread, people are talking about cases where Redditors encourage a person to punch another person who is merely saying a word wrong. We are talking about extreme cases here (or normal cases on Reddit) , but not normal cases in real life. That is why you are downvoted, I believe. Misunderstanding. I passionately dislike how people downvote, because a seemingly offensive opinion can actually stem from an entirely different life experience and perspective. </TEXT>

<TEXT> **TRIGGER WARNING**: DEATH PENALTY and other mentions of death



I am now starting the In Cold Blood series by first introducing the outline of In Cold Blood along with some character personalities in the book. The spoiler warning is nearly useless, as all of us know what happens at the end: Everyone is either dead, fearful or heartbroken. What's interesting is everything in between, so I suppose I should add a spoiler warning for the whole series. This series should be a long one. The highlights of this series should be Good Grief and Glory, as these two songs are the ones that I have solid evidence on the new connections.

Warning: Description may be biased, recommended to read In Cold Blood directly.

&#x200B;

1. **The Clutters**

In Cold Blood is a non-fiction novel by Truman Capote based on the story of 1959 Clutter Family Murder in Holcomb, Kansas. The book was written in a style of journalism and story. Holcomb is a ridiculously small town in the plains of Kansas. The majority of the population is religious and makes a living through agricultural activities, with the Clutters included. The Clutter family was very influential within Holcomb, the nearby Garden City, Finney County in which Holcomb is located, as well as the whole of Kansas. The family were also financially affluent, but Clutters insist on dealing with money mostly by cheque.



 There are a lot of characters in the book, so I am trying to mention only the relevant names. The Clutters were not all murdered. The murdered ones included Hebert Clutter, a decent man with excellent reputation, and Bonnie Clutter, who was Hebert’s wife and was diagnosed with depression. The 2 children of Mr and Mrs Clutter who were murdered included Nancy Clutter and Kenyon Clutter. Nancy had Susan as a friend and Bobby Rupp as a boyfriend.

&#x200B;

2.  **The Murderers**

The infamous murderers were Perry Smith and Richard Hickock who was often referred to as Dick. Accurately speaking, Dick was not confirmed to be the person in charge of murder, but was the one who organized and planned the whole murder. He had decent parenthood and was very pragmatic. He planned to murder the Clutters after hearing the false information that the Clutters had a safe at home. He saw Perry’s unpredictable and destructive rage, and believed that Perry was a ‘natural killer’. It is known that Dick had a car accident and had significant behavourial changes, as mentioned by his parents.

&#x200B;

Perry Smith was in the grey moral area. He was more compassionate than not, especially when comparing to Dick. He was very sensitive to other’s emotions, and was artistic and imaginative. He had a disastrous childhood and family. His parents divorced. He was abused and experienced attempted murder. Due to his ignorant parents, he joined a San Francisco gang. In prison he met Dick and grew more resentful towards society. However, an inmate called Wille-Jay balanced Dick’s malice in prison, who became friends with Perry. In fact, Perry only agreed to meet Dick due to reasons concerning Willie-Jay. It is believed that Perry had a not yet recovered trauma and was prematurely spanked. Then when he was exposed to some particular stimuli, he would misinterpret a person as an abuser, therefore murdering the person with no mercy. Similar to Dick, it is also believed that Perry knew the nature and consequences of his actions, but his mind failed to produce corresponding emotions before the murder.

&#x200B;

The two murderers were hanged as a form of death penalty/capital punishment. There was no strong support for death penalty in the area, as religious people believed that it is immoral. Many people at that time supported life sentence, but this was not plausible in Kanas, as criminals sentenced with life imprisonment were only imprisoned on an average of 15 years. The two stayed at a more decent prison before an unfair trial (Judge and jury faced local pressure, as the court was quite proximal to Holcomb; Some members of jury had stance before the trial; Flawed M’Naughten Rule disregarding mental state of simple schizophrenia. ) Then they stayed at a less decent death row prison and met Andy, Ronnie and Latham. Right before they were executed, Dick uttered his support of death penalty, believing that it was a rightful vengeance for victims. Meanwhile, Perry was against death penalty for moral and legal reasons.

&#x200B;

3.  **Rhetorical devices and other notes**

In Cold Blood’s title hinted that the Clutters were murdered in cold blood, heartlessly and cruelly. Alternatively, it could also mean that capital punishment is merely a murder in cold blood. In Cold Blood frequently uses symbolism and metaphors, with animal symbolisms being the most frequently used. It is said that In Cold Blood uses references to American Dream a lot, though I cannot confirm it myself as I know nothing about American Dream.

&#x200B;

You could see that In Cold Blood has a complex plot, and if my theories were correct, then Bastille uses a lot of details in the book that would not be mentioned in Wikipedia. The relevant information here that will be involved in the future analysis included: Nancy and Robert Rupp’s romance, events in the eye of Perry Smith which included serving in Marine, and suspectedly Bonnie’s mental illness. The use of animal symbolism is also a connection between In Cold Blood and Bastille’s songs. From these clues, you can guess what I will talk about.

&#x200B;

You do not have to memorize the details or frequently refer to this post. I will repeat relevant information while analyzing. This post merely makes things more organized and allows you to have a better understanding of the novel before diving into the analysis. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Analysis of Bastille's era logos </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> [4 different era logos (Tumblr)](https://bbastilles.co.vu/post/625959535152152576)

There are 4 Bastille triangles/deltas, and I believe that they both to an extend reflect their respective album's theme.



1. Original Delta (Bad Blood)

  This delta is a simple isosceles triangle, resembling the 4th letter of the Greek alphabet or simply the numeral '4'.

  The common interpretation is that this delta is used to represent change. Indeed, delta represents b2-4ac in quadratic equations and is the 'changing component'. r/changemyview , an excellent subreddit that challenges our echo chambers and avoidance of comments, also uses a delta to represent a change of view. Why is this relevant to BB? Bad Blood has different themes of change. BB mainly comprises of story-telling BB and mental illness. Bad Blood, as reflected in Forever Ever, shows a change in a character. It can be a change of attitude or of existence (i.e. alive to dead). On the other hand, the mental illness theme reflects a willingness of change, such as the eagerness to listen and talk to others for the first time (i.e. silence to establishment of supportive network.



  There can also be other interpretation. Since delta is Greek in origin, it makes sense that Bastille uses Greek mythology such as Icarus. On the other hand, '4' can be understood as the 4th act of life, which comprises of illnesses, old age and death. These elements are also discussed in BB. Finally, '4' is also coincidentally the unlucky number in Chinese societies, as 4 is pronounced similarly to death.





2.  Norse Valknut delta (Wild World, WWCOMMS)

  The valknut is not exactly the same as the WWCOMMS logo, although they share similarities. Valknut consists of three interlocked triangles, while WWCOMMS logo shows only part of the valknut. There are multiple interpretations of valknut, although they are unanimously about politics and religion, the themes of WW.



  The first interpretation is Hrungnir's heart. Hrungnir is an abusive stone-made giant defeated by Thor in Norse mythology.  This can mean that WWCOMMS, the fictional media of an oppressive regime inspired by 1984, is the heart of oppression. Indeed, media has a huge influence on our political ideology.



  The second one is Odin's power to bind and unbind. This power can render enemies in war helpless, and also eliminate fear and strain by madness, intoxication and inspiration. This further explains media's importance in WWCOMMS world. A media can brainwash its viewers and reduce their critical thinking skills. Meanwhile, it can give an illusion that the world is perfect and get rid of their fear and anger. It can achieve personality cult for rulers. A similar approach of thinking can be applied to the religion aspect of WW when applied to cults.

&#x200B;

  The third one is the modern interpretation of valknut. As valknut is associated with German Paganism, it is used to represent white nationalist groups in some places. This explains why Bastille does not directly use the symbol valknut, but instead create a symbol similar to valknut. This modern interpretation also seems to be related to the modern element of WW. Bastille may use this to insinuate a criticism to white supremacy in some politicians (perhaps Trump). Finally, if we get back to the delta for change, the same symbol can be used to demand a positive change in politics.





3. Neon light Delta (Doom Days)

  This delta is not necessarily made up of neon light tubes. However, it is a deliberate reference to 'running through a red light', which can mean passing into the danger zone (i.e. apocalypse, bad decisions, unknown, death by car accident). Neon light can also be a reference to the classic The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel.

\> When my eyes are stabbed by the flash of a neon light that split the night

  Neon light in the song is often be understood as the negative side of technology.  Indeed, Doom Days has talked about the addiction to mobile phones and technology. (There must be something in the Kool-Aid, stay offline so no one gets hurt) However, from the classic Bastille light metaphor theory, light represents hope, and the neon light can actually be good in Doom Days. 'The lights they cut a path across the room'. It symbolizes escapism with the aid of the Internet and technology, which can be reflected in Joy. And if we are to apply the change meaning in delta, we can interpret that DD represents a change in thinking from caring too much about the world, to indulging in escapism.




4.  Roughly drawn Delta (??)

  I am not sure where the delta in the link comes from. But anyway when we see the profile picture of Bastille on Youtube or IG, we can see an almost equilateral triangle with a roughly drawn bottom line. This can mean 'rotten on the inside', or the shrinking attention span due to the Internet, causing a hastily drawn delta to appear. For the change element, Bastille this time demands us to change the way we are using the Internet, from merely filling the void and boredom, to actually use it for activism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You don't recognize your left wing, or you don't recognize the vocal majority of left wing Reddit as your left wing ? They are different. We might be indulging ourselves with confirmation bias, that we misinterpret the reality.

It is quite ironic that when I attempt to converse with others civilly, which is the basis of democracy, people slam me down with downvotes, call me twisting their points, passive aggressively comment to me. I actually have presented my interpretation of intolerance to intolerance before to people who are using the term. The person who invented the term actually sort of interpret it as a method of last resort when civil conversation becomes counterproductive. Sort of like rise of Nazis in Weimar Republic. The comment I reply to says to look up Paradox of Tolerance on the Internet. I did, and I am disappointed yet unsurprised by the results.

I do not recognize the toxic vocal members of the left. There are tons of these people on every point of the political spectrum, but they are never the majority.

This is a problem on the Internet. It tends to intensify radical comments to gain attention of the public. But is the majority actually that radical? Perhaps. I see many actual people in HK being as radical as on the Internet. But can we determine the percentage of people having a particular trait ourselves? No. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is infuriating yet depressing to know that people's previous expectations to anonymity and the Internet are unmet. I believe pre-Internet generations would expect the Internet to be connecting people of different regions, promoting variety of information and setting a more concrete base for democracy and freedom. Yet what we see here on Reddit is that many (but not all) users are toxic and immersed in their echo chambers. The variety of information turns out to be segregating people by biased journalism. Moreover, the Internet actually erodes our freedom and anonymity by peculiar ways.

I am reminded of Bastille's What You Gonna Do. What are we, as humans, going to do with the Internet? Mindless scrolling?  Making ourselves paranoid through excessive information? (This is especially true if you are addicted to subs like bad cop no donut) Praise and blame with no actual process of thinking nor contribution to finding a solution? The Internet has read our minds, now what are we going to do with it?

However there is still hope to humanity in anonymity. Many popular subreddits are filled with toxic comments which invalidate every opinion that is not exactly the same as theirs. Nevertheless I find r/ChangeMyView interesting , where redditors try to maintain a positive environment while conversing on issues. And then r/PoliticalDiscussion is even more impressive. I have never actually seen people being downvoted to oblivion or are replied with malicious slurs. For less headache-inducing content, perhaps r/EyeBleach or r/CasualConversation would be great. Unfortunately I see more and more hostile comments on these subs, but who knows if it is going to change for the better in the future?

I have also encountered two Redditors here who have inboxed me for meaningful conversations. While I may be downvoted for unpopular opinion yet again(a norm for me), I am yet again reminded of these beautiful souls. Or my beautiful fellow cultists (who are not exactly participating in a cult, they are more like music enthusiasts with an ironic title) who might be peeking at this comment.

For "being cautious", I am never cautious on reading other's stories. Yes, I will be easily scammed. And yes, I actually do fact check news on Reddit. But by making up your life stories, you are actually destroying the basic rule of trust to anonymity on the Internet. "Lose a game and posted on the Internet? Fake. My 36 self having cancer and dying? Fake. Doing impressive music performances? Fake." This attitude described above is very detrimental to conversation. If you really like to accuse others of being fake with no prove, then why can't I accuse you of your accusation being fake? Then why won't you see everything you see as fake? Moreover, these are subtle details in your life. You are not the wrong one for being scammed. The scammer is the wrong one. But if you are being toxic to others all the time, you are the wrong one.

Perhaps you and I are both losers. We are losers for not being able to adapt into anonymity's toxic culture. Or perhaps you and I are both winners. We win by making other people's lives more wholesome and intriguing. We inspire others, despite not being expected to do so.

(Sorry for exhaustingly long comment. Congratulations on making it through here. Your mental health matters. You matter. Taking a break is not wrong. Thanks for reading) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have never seriously listened to Annie Oakley Hanging before, since me "seriously" listening would cost a LOT of time. However while I was finishing In Cold Blood (Yep I finally finished it), the mention of thirteen steps make my heart skip a bit. Another connection? I mean, Annie Oakley HANGING , just like Perry Smith and Hickock Dick hanged.
I was a bit disappointed yet relieved that this is not a connection, or at least not an obvious one.

13 steps are the steps leading up to the gallows. This means that they are facing death, and it seems to be certain that the narrator would die. 13 is perhaps the unlucky number at that time, as 13 is the number of witches in each gathering.

<TEXT> THANK YOU VERY MUCH! FINALLY a topographic map! I am a bit frustrated on the frequent rearrangement of boundaries of the US by now in this sub. This might be my new favorite here.

What's awesome is that your continent's design actually follows the actual plate boundary, and the elevations are roughly similar to that in the mid-oceanic ridge.

I am no expert in geology (even I am very enthusiastic about it), and I am definitely not very knowledgeable on climate and history. However, I am trying to propose some of my theories here concerning this continent.

As Atlantia is located on the divergent plate boundary, its formation is definitely related to volcanism. I would imagine that the volcanism there is extremely active such as to form high mountains of ~6000m altitude. Divergence of plates rarely make such high mountains. Most high mountains are made fold mountains made by convergence of plates. This is the flaw in my explanation, and geologists should be struggling to figure out the actual formation of this continent at this timeline.

I notice that there are island arcs on both the east and west to the main island. Perhaps there is one hot spot on each of the respective plates. When the plates move while the hot spot does not, islands are formed. Older islands are further away from the plate boundary and are eroded to become smaller.

From what I know, civilization on this continent would most likely be in the style of Africa, as in a clutter of small civilizations, rather than the more connected style of Europe. Conquering the whole Atlantia would be difficult due to the vastly different climates present.

I would believe that Moroccans would discover and inhabit this piece of land first. The geology and climate of some parts of Atlantia are quite similar to that of Morocco. Spainish civilizations might be able to control Atlantia next.

The general historical development of Atlantia would be fairly similar to that of Africa. Many places are sparsely populated, but there are some influential civilizations that might even be powerful enough to conquer parts of Europe and Africa, or even America.

The topography of Atlantia might delay the discovery of America for Europeans. Whoever gets control of Atlantia gets control of America.

I am quite pessimistic on the development of Atlantia. It actually has an absurdly high level of geological resources that can be comparable to Iceland. Geothermal energy would be the easiest source of energy. These resources attract many different monarchs from Europe and Africa. With the addition of the control of transport between America and Europe, the continent would likely to be in a constant war state. Internal conflicts as well as conflicts between colonalists would turn parts of the continent into ruin. The frequent earthquakes throughout Atlantia also does not favour the formation of superpowers.

On a brighter note, the countries can definitely be self-reliant through fishing, mining for geological resources, and farming with the favourable andisol-rich soil. Once the politics become stable, countries in Atlantia have the potential of becoming the most sustainable countries in the world, while geotourism and ecotourism brings massive benefits to locals there. I imagine a new New Zealand or Iceland. If not, Atlantia would be the new Philippines, and I believe the latter is more possible. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Brief analysis on elements used in Bastille songs with their relations to the theme of the songs (Aside from lyrics and music video) </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> When I say 'brief', you can expect that my post is not *that* brief. When I say brief, I mean that there are too many things, that it is impossible to cover them all.

So I believe that Dan is such a perfectionist that he wouldn't merely use lyrics and videos as methods to convey each song's message. Indeed, there is a close relation between music and lyrics, that we might not be able to get the whole picture from analyzing only one of the elements. Of course, you do not really have to analyze every single detail in a song. Listening to music is a form of art appreciation, and everyone has the right to appreciate a song from different angles. I am just providing another elements for you to appreciate the works of art of our divine leaders. And note that not every song has these elements, just as not every word of lyrics has double entendre or metaphors.

&#x200B;

1. Methods to stress and highlight words

As you may listen to [Forever Ever](https://youtu.be/AWva3YG3BiE) (OPH2), you may notice the beautiful stress of words spoken, such as 'light', 'breath' and 'expect'. However, stressing words are more difficult to be done in melodic songs. Highlighting words have to be done simultaneously in different elements.

Let us take [What You Gonna Do](https://youtu.be/vleS5vua5-Y) as an example. The spoken stress of word on 'WHAT' is highlighted. There is also the technique of using high and long notes as to highlight words. With the combination of both, 'what' is highlighted, stressing that the lyrics is a question. It demands us to think for a change and for reflection. On the other hand, songs like [Pompeii](https://youtu.be/F90Cw4l-8NY) do not have question words highlighted. For example, "how am I gonna be an optimist about this" does not have 'how' stressed like the 'WHAT' mentioned. This is because this question in Pompeii is not actually demanding us to think. This question is to highlight the hopelessness of the narrator by asking for help from the listeners, or is simply a rhetorical question. However, 'how' still has its importance as there are not much key word in this sentence.  From these examples, you can actually see how the stress on words affect a sentence's meaning.

&#x200B;

2.  Word painting (lyrics painting/ music imagery)

With the above theory, you may actually notice tons of exceptions in Bastille songs. Many notable ones are from [The Waves](https://youtu.be/Z44Kp-cYdM4) . ' The WAVES---- are crashing down on you and me again, again, again.' "Waves definitely has a strong emphasis with its high, long notes and some vocal stress. However, "crashing down" is actually very short, but aren't those the most important words? This is because the length and position of note is used in word painting. Almost every lyric in the song has word painting, but with the chorus as the most noticeable one. 'The WAVES' go higher in terms of notes, as waves are formed. 'crashing down' is a short period of lowering notes. It is a strong motion of water, so crashing down is very vocally strong, and this also creates an emphasis on these key words.

A tip of noticing this technique is by observing whether there are changes in the melody between the verses. [Four Walls](https://youtu.be/IBum4BroMKU) has slightly varied melody in verse 1 and verse 2. "To keep you from the Sun" has the Sun goes upwards (sunrise) and downwards (sunset). Meanwhile, "In Cold Blood hang you up" has "up" suspended without going downwards. (Listening to this song in the process of reading is very depressing.)

&#x200B;

3.  Creating atmosphere

Music can create an emotion and an atmosphere by tempo (speed) and melody (major/minor key). For instance, both Four Walls and [Oil on Water](https://youtu.be/j7eJqpDUrSg) has a slower speed and minor key. (Major key: Do re me fa so la ti do, Minor key:La ti do re me fa si la) From 1:39 onwards, Oil on Water actually has a breathing track, and if you notice, the track actually correspond to the rhythm of the song. This shows that Oil on Water actually has its tempo adjusted to correspond to the song.

There are A LOT of exceptions on this one, as Bastille songs are known as upbeat songs with depressing lyrics. Let us take [Good Grief](https://youtu.be/ZWCB3hpJDXM) as an example. From an initial look, it does not seem to make sense that a song of grief would make use of such happy melody. However when we look at the lyrics 'dancing at your funeral', you might know that this song is based on this element: dancing in confusion, and as to mask the extreme grief and sadness. This is the same with other songs such as Million Pieces or Lethargy. The happy melody is to highlight the confusion of the narrator, and Million Pieces in particular is based on escapism, on 'drink, fuck, dance, right to disaster' and masks the terror from the apocalypse.

&#x200B;

4. Conversations in songs

This element is very creative, yet there are at least two songs that have this element-- [Skulls](https://youtu.be/3vEze0jSDU8) and [Another Place](https://youtu.be/cKRwmHppvTE?t=150) . What is even more impressive is that the two songs use different techniques to create a conversation. From this conversation feature, you can understand why these two songs (Skulls/Remains, Another Place) have another version with collaboration. You can identify two narrators in Skulls easily as there is an octave of difference. I deliberately linked Another Place to 2:30, which is my favourite part and why I prefer this original than the one with collaboration. The first narrator is softer in voice, while the second is deeper in voice. This one is actually brilliant.

&#x200B;

5. Other elements (used in pre-Bastille songs)

The first one is the change of key/octave as an escalation of atmosphere. This technique can be seen in [Divide](https://youtu.be/0w9dk1XR3zg) and [Words are Words (Pre-Bastille Dan)](https://youtu.be/uglKyntkS2U) .

The second is quite interesting, and it is seen in only pre-Bastille songs. For me, I see the lyrics of many pre-Bastille songs as contemporary poetry put with a melody. I can write the lyrics out in a style similar to that of Long Way Down by Jason Reynolds. I shall take Dictator as an example.

<TEXT> Firstly, let me clarify that I will use your dictionary definition of racism. And I do not aim to change your view (that can be a bonus, but I don't think I will be able to). I am merely letting you know more about why black people would use the 'n' word. Note that the theories below are NOT YET CONFIRMED. With the awkward timing here, I will not find sources to see if I am correct. Nevertheless, this is what I would guess.

There is an [enlightening video](https://youtu.be/Dd7dQh8u4Hc) (at least for me, a linguistic enthusiast) about swearing and their uses.  The video is approximately 11 minutes long. You might want to skip to 2:24 for the video to start talking about relevant topics. If you are in a hurry, you might even want to skip to 7:40 or 8:30.

At the moment, non-people of colour mainly use the N word as an abusive and dysphemistic swear word. In other words, they are malicious in intent. Meanwhile, black people start to use the same word as emphatic swears, to highlight the emotions present only in deeply necessary situations. A majority of black people even use the N word as an idiomatic swear word to show informality.

Now you may say that this is again talking about intention, but the following paragraphs are the most important ones.

As the video mentioned, abusive/dysphemistic slurs appear in the background of inequality, hatred and discrimination. The change in usage among black people signifies the empowerment of blacks, which is why many insist on the continual usage of the N word in black people.

Now why can't non-people of colour use this word? It is because inequality and discrimination still exists in this group. It would be meaningless to change the usage of this word. (I apologize for not explaining this part well).

It is assumed that racial equality would be progressed in future years. Then the N word would quickly lose its function. Meanwhile, black people can reintroduce the empowering meaning back to this N word as a reminder that racial equality cannot be taken granted.

Why is the word already been used in the black community? It is of hope that changes will happen. And why can't this word has its meaning replaced later? It is because language can influence people's thoughts and emotions. Take the bias of English to German as an example. There are actually no "formal" and "informal" words, there are only biases. Informal words usually have german roots, while formal words usually have french or latin roots. This bias incorporates into our mindset. What do you think of when mentioning Germans? For me, it is the mental image of a man drinking beer, saying rough slurs and being impolite. But I have nothing against Germans. I have heard that they are extremely diligent, creative and punctual.  The beer thing stems from the ubiquitous presence of beer in German cuisine, but what about the other biases, when I have never even travelled to Germany? It is the language bias.

So words can influence our thinking. The change of N word to idiomatic swearing in black people reinforce self-acceptance. Meanwhile, when there is no wide and concrete acceptance for racial minorities and simultaneously with the presence of derogatory N word, the tide of acceptance can be stopped.

I truly hope my theory is correct. If so, the initiator of this N- word change is definitely a genius.

<TEXT> I am extremely strict on downvotes. I do not even like downvoting offensive comments. I only downvote comments that are intentionally and deeply malicious, and simultaneously that the commentor refuses to have a constructive conversation to learn that what they say is offensive. For misinformation, sometimes OP is actually mistaken and is willing to delete the false information. You can never really determine the actual intention of a person until you have a conversation with them or look through a larger amount of comments. That is why I would not really use the term "they made the post to be an asshole". How can we determine whether one is an asshole or not? How can we know the intention of OP making the post? For this, I would therefore first assume that everyone is of good intention.

The last point is important. We all would slip some offensive comments or share incorrect information some time, and this is okay as long as we are willing to correct it. Simply downvoting a comment without explaining can leave a person of good will confused and invalidated.

I usually make essays here on Reddit, and many of them are either real unpopular opinion (not like on the unpopular opinion sub) or analysis essays. So you can expect that my comments would be low in karma, or downvoted.

I doubt that I understand downvoting culture here either. I am only active for a year, and I have the account forgotten in the first year. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am now randomly figuring out connections that I could think of. Some of them are related to this post, some are not. I think I would need a thread of individual comments for easier reading.

Up(sky, heaven, Sun, light, day, morning), Down(floor, hell, dark, night)

The "up" words indicate hopes AND progression, while the "down" words indicate desparation, hopelessness AND "pedaling backwards".

Examples:

>You'll never get to heaven on a night like this [Those Nights]

>There's no looking up for heaven [Glory]

You see, both are also related to religion along with "up" definitions with the use of "heaven". However, Glory is even more complex. No looking up for heaven simultaneously mean positively, no perfection (anti-perfectionism) AND pessimistically, no hope. This is an interesting topic that will be discussed in In Cold Blood series.

>He's throwing his hands up to the sky [Final Hour]

This one is a bit interesting. Hands up to the sky can also mean giving up. But this indicates frustration from implementing the hope of reversing climate change.

>Partners in crime in the dead of the night [Nocturnal Creatures]

Escapism is adopted in desparation. It hinders progress, so the quote makes sense. No progress is done from people indulging in Western entertainment during post-USSR in Russia.

>The orange sky says the night's alive

This one is another complex one. If sky and night is opposite , then why would they be put together? It says that the night is vibrant due to the shining lights from a dance hall. But perhaps with this up-and-down theory, it says that hope can only exist when there is hopelessness. Morning can only exist when there is night. Everything is relative. The existence of hope indicates the existence of hopelessness. I might be making things to complex here though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> WYGD is definitely derived from some ideas of Blame. WYGD is about the unhealthy obsession of social media and attention (possibly also for polticians) leading to massive consequences (mental health issues, losing friends and family, and addiction). Meanwhile Blame is about the unhealthy obsession of following a gang or a cult leading to massive consequences (losing friends and family and addiction). The theme is very similar.

"You got the power and control" has connections to both Power and What You Gonna Do. This indicates that people in gangs and cults typically wish to have more power and control over others. Then Power explains the possible nature that humans seek power while explaining why people in gangs and cults lack power (because there are already politicians refusing to give power to others). Or perhaps Power is not only about Trump/Boris, but also about the refusal of joining gangs and cults. And meanwhile,  Blame is not merely about cults and gangs, but also personality cults in populism and 1984, adding to the theme of WWCOMMS.

Let us see the connections:

Cults and gangs: You got the power and control here. This is my body and this is my soul.

Resistance againts cults and gangs: Did you really think I'd fall to my knees. Just to pray for some sweet simplicity?

Cults and gangs: Say goodbye to your mother, your father, your son

Resistance against cults and gangs: So when you cut me, cut me deep. Hurt the ones you love the most easily.

With "sweet simplicity", Power can be a connection to Good Grief and the mental health/relationship theme in BB.

From the connections of three songs, we are able to deduce three different timelines concerning different people.


1. Cults and gangs: Establishment and promotion of cults/gangs (Blame), joining of online segment of obsession (WYGD), resistance to these influences(Power), then encouraging others to use social media against cults/gangs(WYGD).

Blame: blaming opposing forces such as concerned family members

2. Politics: Establishment of populist/authoritarian governments(Blame), joining of online cult and mindless scrolling of news and propaganda related to the government(WYGD), resistance against the governments(Power), then encouragimg others against online addiction, and take actual action such as (online) activism, protests and voting.

Blame: blaming opposing parties for their own faults

3. Social media: Introduction of social media(Blame), online addiction of people(WYGD), people opposing online addiction(Power, WYGD)

Blame: blaming politicians(virtue signaling), blaming people's flaws (toxic feedback), indicates that people only blame on the Internet without actual contribution

<TEXT> Tuff and basalt are different from each other. Tuff is made from solidified volcanic ash, while basalt is made from solidified lava.

It is true that quite a lot of the rocks with hexagonal jointing are extrusive igneous. After all, these joints mainly occur in igneous rocks. Basalt in particular is one of the most common rocks with hexagonal jointing. However tuff can also have hexagonal columnar jointing.

I should correct my statement on the existence of two different rocks in the same place. Apparently gneiss, a metamorphic rock, can exist together with granite in an area. And also Devils Tower, an igneous structure with columnar jointing, is surrounded by sedimentary rocks. I still believe that this mushroom is sedimentary in origin, unless I get a closer look and see interlocking crystals. It is too blurry to see, but I vaguely see some layers in the rock, especially at the bottom left of the rock. Wikipedia also confirms that the coast of Bay of Fundy has lots of fossil-bearing sedimentary rocks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not an expert either (high school), but stacks are not really made up of basalt generally, even that it is very possible. Columnar basalt is found in Iceland, for example. Columnar jointing in some basaltic rocks make stacks easier to be formed, but stacks can also comprise of limestone or other rocks. Sea stacks in my area are made up of hexagonal columnar volcanic tuff.

Differentual resistance is definitely a possible explanations for this outcrop. Nevertheless I am in doubt of using the term "stack". Stack has steep and large cliffs, which is hard to be used to describe this small mushroom.

I believe that your understanding of stacks surrounded by limestone is due to your local geology. Yes, it is definitely possible. I could imagine limestone as sea bed, then basalt as formed from extrusive volcanism covering some rocks. However it is also difficult to generalize the situation of the world in this way, I believe. The flaw is that basalt and limestone are rocks with entirely different origins, that it can be difficult to be found in the same area.

Rather, it can be possible that one rock simply has more cracks than the other, creating more lines of weaknesses for erosion to be concentrated there. Alternatively, the mushroom can be made up of dolomite(Mg,CaCO3) surrounded by limestone (CaCO3) The magnesium makes dolomite significantly more resistant to chemical weathering by acid rain or rainwater with natural carbonic acid. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know there are already correct answers, but for me, it might not be enough to satisfy my curiosity. So I am going to make an overly long essay here, covering the formation of the beach, the muschroom rock and the vegetation.

Everyone studying geology/middle to high school geography would know of erosion (removal of materials during high wave energy) and deposition (addition of sediment during low wave energy). Some more terms include longshore drift (transport of sediments along coast in zigzag motion by waves). However how is it possible for both to be present in the same place?

When talking about "bay", I would think of deposition due to wave refraction towards headlands. However Bay of Fundy is merely a narrow inlet intestifying wave energy and wind energy. Thus we can explain the cliffs along this large Bay, as well as the presence of erosion in the rock. What about the beach as a depositional landform? It is present largely due to the nearby rivers (Cogmagan River and the river near Anderson Hollow Lighthouse). By longshore drift, sediments from the rivers are brought to this beach and are forced to stop behind a headland. The larger area also has an abundance of sediment due to Petitcodiac River.

Now the rock. Hydraulic action and abrasion, the strongest erosional forces in wave erosion, are always concentrated between the low and high tide level. They are also concentrated along lines of weaknesses. From the slightly visible layers in the bottom of the mushroom rock, I would assume that this rock is comprised of clastic sedimentary rock. It has bands/ layers of rock (strata) with a line of weakness (bedding plane). The bedding planes make the rock even more vulnerable to erosion.

I saw someone mentioning that caves are present here. Sea caves are also caused by wave erosion, but it must be done with some help of lines of weaknesses (faults or bedding planes).

You can actually see the low tide level (from the "surface" here), high tide level (from the upper edge of neck) and highest tide level (from the boundary from presence to absence of vegetation). Vegetation typically hates to be damaged by waves.

How are the plants formed? From my view, they do not seem to be mangrove plants. They are just weeds. There are two possibilities for this to happen. The first theory is that the rock is originally connected to inland by some rocks that are eroded away overtime. Waves destroy the plants present within its tidal range, leaving out this narrow strip of plant.

Alternatively, the mushroom is formed first, then the plants. With this sequence, the plants' seeds are transported away through wind and land at this nice rock (perhaps due to the ocean winds inhibiting the seeds from going further into the ocean) There are favorable factors for the plants. If seeds landed at the beach, they will not grow due to the unfavorably high salinity of soil. It is quite difficult to rely on the inconsistent rainwater that can be infiltrated quickly through the highly permeable clay. Lucky that they landed on the rock. In addition, seawater is actually slightly alkaline. The small amounts of sea salt brought by wind make the rock surface alkaline. They provide nutrients, with potassium ion as the most needed while abundant ion, to the plants. Potassium ion is important for photosynthesis and is one of the essential ions of plants.

So here is my long essay which I would not expect people to read. I am merely a high school (the term is senior form secondary school here) student studying geography, biology annd chemistry. You now know the reliability, but you will also know that I am obsessed with geology. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Right as I am writing, I realize that I will be downvoted as usual. Possibly some of the comments would be insolent, but I wish to elaborate my ideas. We really have to reflect and see how well our activism is going.

I do not like the ideologies of conservatives either. But I love them as humans, and I will try to guide them away from hatred. Well, this is what tolerance can be achieved, guiding others away from hatred. So far you might be thinking why I would be downvoted, or you might think I am twisting your words (if so, please explain this in detail).

Now I am copying from Wikipedia.

> **Unlimited** tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.—In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as **we can counter them by rational argument** and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should **claim the right to suppress them** if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are **not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument**;

From this, we can know that intolerance to the intolerent is not equivalent to shaming people with intolerant ideologies. Instead, intolerance also includes not actually accepting the opinion openly or in acquiesce. This means that intolerance to hatred can actually be done by civil conversations. Why, you may wonder, will a hateful person be able to do civil conversations? This is because not all homophobes are actually extremely hateful to gays and are willing to take action against our community. They can just be ignorant or misleaded in the past. Same as to with other forms of hatred, such as transphobia ot racism. Therefore, we can actually try to transform them to become kinder through discussion.

The best example I can think of is a post of a "Karen" smiling and saying (slightly) hateful comments, then there are people using "homophobe" or "racist" to describe her. She then becomes upset, and is labelled as "fragile white Karen". The good thing of this measure is that she then knows that what she is saying is wrong and is unwelcomed. The bad thing is that this can easily go wrong. By using these wording, it does feel like you are trying to offend her rather than to educate her. She may turn defensive. One side would go "stupid conservatives being so intolerant", the other will go "those libtards brainwashed to accusing others of being homophobic".

So what is the alternative? Real civil conversations trying to narrow the chasm between homophobes and GRSM. Explain why this is offensive to others. (Avoid using phobia wordings, as they would go "I am not afraid of homosexuals") Let them think deeply. It doesn't matter if you have succeeded, because deep-rooted hatred is difficult to eradicate. But by "intolerating" them (in quotation marks because it is the meaning which many people in Reddit use but not my definition, nor is the person creating the idea of paradox of tolerance according to my observation), it might work sometimes, but in those times, it is treating the symptom but not the root cause. They might be shamed into not saying the words they have said, but it can also make them develop the idea that "People supporting GRSM is just toxic, and I will only pretend being supportive in times when they are present"

Also, I wish to say how paradox of tolerance can be applied. Nazis in Weimar Republic is almost a perfect example. When the public opinion overwhelmingly favours dangerous bigotry, it is acceptable to suppress bigotry through stronger constitutional actions. Then education can be implemented to gently change the public opinion, because mere suppression rarely works. Of course given what a failure Weimar Republic is, this is most likely implausible.


Actually, your first part makes perfect sense. The use of "bigot" can be counterproductive in some situations, but it is still okay. However at the point of "fuck your noise", I feel a bit disappointed. The person you are replying to seems to be misunderstanding rather than hateful before the thread below, and it is not necessary to suppress him/her/them in this case. The fuck part may be turning the person defensive, therefore proving my point, but we can never know the person's original thoughts. Nevertheless, I understand, or will try to understand, your frustration and anger.

And congratulations for making this far. I know reading such a long comment is hard. I can do reading for hours but not reading on the Internet for minutes. I sincerely hope to have a constructive conversation with appropriate tone with people who are able to do so. I look forward to this even it is not very likely. Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Is it possible for "cast their eyes right to the ground" be talking about looking at her buried body and diary six feet under the ground? I have not watched Laura Palmer yet, so I am not sure.

"Will you come down at all" seems to be like Icarus and Million Pieces (Don't pull me down from the ceiling) simultaneously.


[trigger warning]

If "Cutting out a different path" can refer to walking along a dangerous path, it might be that she is attempting passive self harm, therefore making dangerous decisions and cutting out a different path? The use of "cut" also makes this more disturbing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> JustaBastilleFan suggested that Four Walls (Ballad of Perry Smith) references Ballad of Reading Gaol by Oscar Wilde during the song discussion on the main sub. Indeed, both the song, In Cold Blood, and Ballad of Reading Gaol have a common theme of death penalty.

From the suprising connections between In Cold Blood and Good Grief music video, I would assume that there are more literature references in the videos, not just in the lyrics. The first ones I would think of is about the undead. The undead is featured in Pompeii, Of the Night and Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Perhaps there are some other allusions that we can work on? Another one, which should be more obvious, is the use of the goat figure from the Sheep and the Goats of Bible.


Literature references are really cool, and I wonder if any of these works would lead to another massive network of interpretation, like Laura Palmer and In Cold Blood do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Talking about balance, I have just thought of how to achieve this balance between mental health and being more knowledgeable at the world, and I wish to share with you all here. Or at least for my own reference.

Reading the news or watching viral videos mainly has two functions: One is to know more of the world, so that we can respond to issues more relevantly. For example, there may be a pandemic coming in 2020 (talking about Dec 2019 HK), so you may need to buy some medical masks for preparation. The other is to establish a well-rounded opinion of the world as well as a set of positive moral values, so as to respond more accurately, likely through political means. For example, if we see social issues being ignored by politicians, we can vote those politicians out in the next election.

Maintaining the balance refers to being able to get the functions of absorbing information. If you do not read the news at all, of course you would not know more about the world or make a well-informed opinion. On the other hand, if you read excessive information such as scrolling on r/policebrutality2020 or r/HongKong all day, you would not form a new opinion in the process. It is likely that you would reinforce your beliefs and strengthen the echo chamber. And when these news start to affect your mental health, of course you would not establish a positive moral value. Perhaps you may become more destructively pessimistic, which is not making the most of the benefits of information either.

So I have more stances to share with you in the following paragraph. What contributes to political events the most? It is not individual, small and trivial events, such as a police officer destroying a wheelchair somewhere at least 500km away from you. It is the general trends of social development, such as the trend of the increasing (attention of) police brutality and racism around the world, or the trend of democracy (Arab Spring) around the world. It is also (your local) government policies and development of groundbreaking technology (5G). So even I support BLM as a non-American and activism against police brutality, I did not join r/policebrutality2020. Despite that coronavirus is also affecting me, r/coronavirus is not very necessary for me.

What is the most efficient and least useful ways of absorbing information? I believe reading well-rounded and neutral analysis and participating in civil discussions from people of different ideology would be the best. For me, I like reading analysis from BBC and RTHK. I joined r/changemyview and r/PoliticalDiscussion for similar purposes. Meanwhile, subs like r/iamatotalpieceofshit or r/idiotsincars would be useless and perhaps even harmful for most. It can be temporarily useful as a way to know right from wrong, but I would assume that most people would know that even before joining the subs. These subreddits may potentially create more discontent of the world among redditors.

I know that you might feel uncomfortable at reading my long analysis. Perhaps you may even feel infuriated. I know my comments are always controversial judging from downvotes and comments. It is right to have a different opinion, because this is what democracy is. So I would try not to care about whether you upvote or downvote my comment, because it is not even conducive. I may read your comments and respond if I have the right mental state to do so. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To complete the analysis, THIS SONG IS ALSO RELATED TO IN COLD BLOOD. YES. From the sitting at the edge of the water, to two men at 1:22. The two men might represent Perry Smith and Dick. And girl is Nancy in In Cold Blood, which I would analyze later after finishing the book.

Laura Palmer and In Cold Blood is SO IMPORTANT I couldn't believe that people have not noticed their importance and omnipotence in Bastille songs.

I have already suspected the connection between the novel and the video after reading about the part of the diary. The perfect pink room is Nancy's room, and the burial of the diary is a bit more complex. I would take a deeper look later.

On the mental illness thing, both Herb Clutter's wife and Perry suffer from mental illness, namely depression/anxiety and borderline personality disorder respectively. So, yes, it makes sense again.

And in case you are wondering, YES there is a possibility that Perry SMITH is another clue that Dan identifies some conditions of Perry Smith. And the name connection has happened before in Daniel in the Den. We have some crucial information here.

By the way, Nancy and Bobby Rupp's relationship in In Cold Blood is what Good Grief is about. And finally at a glance, would the knifes and scissors represent that she wants to get rid of her past (diary) by the eagerness of self harm? And the knifes and scissors also have meaning in terms of In Cold Blood. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Every subreddit is somewhat an echo chamber (perhals except for r/politicaldiscussion or r/changemyview ) and it should be our responsibility to break echo chambers apart. However, an individual's action is sometimes like a grain against a tall wall. And it seems to be impossible to gather people quickly against echo chambers. People in echo chambers get furiously defensive, that I feel I would not be able to withstand those emotions right now. Writing while being highly pressured is not productive at the end anyway.

I also look forward to polite and civil discussions, but is it possible, for Reddit's downvote design? Or for the Internet's anonymity? Right now I feel hopeless but yet hopeful for the future. It is the worst of times considering the existence of the pandemic, of police brutality, of social division and of echo chambers. But it is the best of times, as people are finally knowing more about social issues, as protests are springing up, and as the voice for change is stronger than ever around the world. Living in these strange new times is depressing and exhausting, yet exciting and motivating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well I might not be able to post it or even comment about it even assuming that they would not block me. When I wrote that long comment above and read the comments, it somehow triggered a panic attack. I am not sure whether I can actually handle making the post and then receiving the comments. I understand that after making the post about "discussion", then it is abslolutely required to participate in the discussion within the comment section. I might try to do so when I have a better mental state, as this is important and relates to improving the quality of activism in GRSM. But really, don't expect me to do the post that soon. I am not that confident right now, and this discomfort may never end. It also seems that my stance is rather controversial even in this sub, so I am definitely not sure whether r/gendercynical can really think deeply about the issue or resort to personal attacks and strong hateful emotions.

It saddens me that I wish to participate more on social movements but I do not really have to mental capacity to do so. Being truly supportive is very difficult, especially when my standards for "supportive" and "learn" are higher than those around me. I am often said that when I say to learn something, I mean understanding every word, every related concept, participating actively and applying concepts to real life. Not to mention that every person's experience and perspective are different, making every single seemingly simple issue become complex.        It also saddens me that people do not have the sympathy and compassion for people with different opinions or with inherent characteristics. I try not to invalidate others' opinions, but is it truly possible in every situation without harming myself? I feel that I am becoming conservative overtime, and this is definitely bad news, as I am not even an adult. I also regret to admit that I am becoming apathetic towards politics. Or is it taking care of myself, or emotional maturity, or becoming cold-hearted towards others? I know many Redditors would choose the last option, given that there is a hatred towards conservatives.

Sorry for the vent. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I appreciate that you have tried different hobbies. There is a thing called activation paradox, in which when you have no motivation in doing anythingxm, you have to actually force yourself to do something in order to attain motivation for it. I also appreciate that you have to courage to seek help here. The Internet is not always helpful, but seeking help is an important step.

You don't have to be good at your hobbies. And for "being good at anything", you don't have to be the best at something to be called good at it. Everyone has different styles of developing a hobby. Some can stick to one, others may jump from one hobby to another, and changing hobbies from time to time is valid. For me, I also rely on random bursts of energy for working. It might not seem to be as efficient as people with a timetable, but if it works, it works. You don't have to be very knowledgeable at your hobby either.

If you are worried about not being good, have you tired listening to music or reading? Enjoying either does not require you to be good at it, since there are absolutely no standards for judging your ability.

You are not boring. Nobody is, as everyone is inherently special and unique. No human is the same as the other, so everyone is special and is not boring. For me, even listening about struggles and life stories can be fascinating, even seemingly mundane ones like a working schedule. Hobbies can increase the variety of discussion topics, but they are not necessary for discussion. And you do not have to actively contribute and talk if you find the right person. Listening to others instead can be helpful, and you might feel more comfortable too. I believe that if you feel and convince yourself that you are not boring and put passion into your words, people can find your topics interesting more easily.

There are a few questions I wish to ask you. Do you struggle in maintaining concentration and motivation in other aspects of life, such as working and studying? Also, can you list some interests that you have tried? And finally, exactly how long does each hobby typically last for you? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that many may not have the energy or ability to answer people's questions on sexuality, gender or other issues such as race. However, it is an activist's responsibility to do so. When people are genuinely asking questions, it can be a brilliant opportunity to guide someone to become an ally. Isn't this what activists do, that is to help with positive social changes? I can sympathize with minorities who are not willing to make conversations, but I do not really get activists who seem to be screaming around rather than making positive experiences of GRSM for people that might be ignorantly hateful.

It is indeed quite unreasonable for us to be constantly justifying our existence. However, unlike topics such as race and physical disabilities, sexuality and gender are very confusing topics. It may take a gay person like me to take years to grasp the gist of the concept of sexuality and gender, let alone people who have no experiences in these topics? And when we learn, it is perfectly normal to have questions. If we just ignore people's questions and make them blindly swallow up acceptance for GRSM, there would not be solid acceptance. They may resort to claiming as supportive while still being hateful in details.

For the endless barrage of constant critique, I believe there is a difference between asking genuine questions and criticism. It is the choice of wordings and attitude of speaking. And if asking questions is criticism, then why isn't students throwing questions at teachers not considered as criticism? It is a process of learning, that is to identify things that one does not understand, picking them up and trying to explore the answers through the help of others. And learning is the crucial step for being an ally.

And finally concerning the issue of "nuance", it is true that our actions and words are often twisted by malicious people. However, us being intimidated by the misleading comments is basically what those people want. Having our actions twisted and interpreted should not be a reason to refrain us from doing what is correct. We can choose to clarify our words but not choosing to give up.

Sorry if my wordings are too strong. (and I know this comment is long) I know that these conversations require very precise wordings with very civil tone to produce the maximum impact. But unfortunately I am still learning English and I am definitely not confident in the tone thing. This is another reason why we cannot expect everyone to answer genuine questions from others. But as I mentioned, I believe it is an activist's responsibility to do so.

(And finally @gaygunner919 , may I quote your comment on r/gendercynical so as to make trans people there to improve their activism? ) </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is actually a recommended coping strategy. A more usual wording would be "friend" rather than "parent", as some may have shitty parents but at least friendships are mostly voluntary. With this strategy, you would then start to imagine the attitude (patient and kind), the tone (soft but convincing) and the wording when challenging your thoughts.

Plainly resisting the thoughts can be regarded as a form of denial or suppression of emotions, which might be seemingly helpful in the short term, but detrimental in the long term. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe that a majority of people making the "not all cops" statements should have some positive experiences or images of the police. Take me as an example. I also have the urge to reply "not all cops" while people making generalized statements. Then I realized this is not helping the cause (well both generalizing and diverting attention to wording are problematic) after a tour to r/changemyview .

One key point is that not everyone lives in a place with palpable diversity, such that not everyone can actually witness police brutality in close proximity. Watching news on TV can still make us feel that these things are far away from our reality. "Wars are in Iran and I live in such a peaceful place that I do not need to care about it." And then there are people who do not live in the US and enjoy the benefits of an excellent justice system, or those who live in places where there WERE good police-civilian relationships (like me in Hong Kong).

So with no experiences of police problems firsthand and tons of positive experiences, they may actually deny (or psychologically deny even knowing that it is true) the existence of the police brutality, and tries to defend the police by saying that not all police are bad.

I believe this is a problem that is particularly serious with the slogan of ACAB. This slogan actually tries to acknowledge the existence of systematic problems within the US police,  that "good cops" who know about police brutality but do nothing about it are also bastards. Unfortunately when it comes to the eyes of a person without experiences of police problems, it suddenly becomes an offense to the police community, and the slogan fails to educate them on the systematic racism of cops in the US. This is why r/changemyview has tons of posts about ACAB.

After reading your post, I feel that you are extremely infuriated. Perhaps if you feel the need, you can take a break from the news and social media for a while, or at least reduce amount of information intake from subs that feature overly detailed police brutality news. Fighting with sustainability is important, and it is not wrong to take a break for a while. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a lot of sexualities, as sexuality is a spectrum. You do not have to pressure yourself to constantly try to label yourself. However, it is perfectly normal to be curious of it. I can provide you with some possibilities, but they might not be accurate.

Your wordings of "an interest in men" or "do not find men attractive" immediately make me think of a biromantic heterosexual. Romantic attraction and sexual attraction are different concepts. Romantic attraction is that you would like to establish a loving and close relationship with others, and perhaps involve in activities such as cuddling. Meanwhile, sexual attraction might be like finding others attractive, being horny and wanting to masturbate. (Note these are not the only definitions and examples) So biromantic means you can have romantic relationships with both/all genders/sexes, meanwhile heterosexual means you can have sexual relationships with your opposite sex.

Then there is the possibility of bisexual with preference to women. Bisexuality is a spectrum. One can have an unbalanced appeal to different genders. For example, you might have a preference to women than men.

There is also the possibility that you are a bisexual with a trauma that you feel little attraction to men. Trauma can have a huge effect and causes immense stress even after years. But things will get better. I doubt that the term "internalized homophobia" can be exactly correct in this situation, but no matter you love which gender, it is always valid.

I am really sorry to hear that someone pressured you into the gay scene, and I am proud of you to empower yourself and stop the person. Sometimes some men can be very inconsiderate and toxic. Just to remind you that even if you are feeling lonely, you need not reconnect with people who make you feel uncomfortable. (You are not required to forgive either) You wouldn't drink poison even if you are thirsty.

It is definitely okay to not pursue a man. Like you have said, you can experiment with others if you wish. Do what you are comfortable to do, and your feelings are definitely valid and important. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Monster House Analysis (Film Theory: Feminism, Police, Crime, Drug) </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-07-15 18:37:19 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT>  First time writing a film theory and posting on this subreddit. I feel the need to write because I could hardly find any analysis on the supposedly light-hearted Monster House cartoon on the Internet, except for brushing that there is the presence of ‘adult humour’. At least I, still not yet an adult, do not find any of them hilarious.

&#x200B;

Plot:

 This film explores the story of a house that swallows everything on its lawn, from tricycles, basketballs, to even humans. It is even protected by an infuriated old man who is the owner of the house. Then there are three children, one (DJ) living directly across the house, one (Chawder)being the friend, and the third one(Jenny) comes from a high-class school who only meet the boys from doing a school project. The three resembles Harry, Ron and Hermoine from Harry Potter respectively. After almost being swallowed by the house, the children have sought help from one of their babysitters and even the police. Expectedly, the adults do not believe in the children. Therefore, the protagonists decide to destroy the house by taking the advice of a gamer to go to the ‘heart’ of the house and kill it with ~~guns~~ water guns.

After a series of events, the children find out that the house is haunted by, or rather merge its form with, the elder’s wife. Being mocked by children in a circus for her enormous body size, the wife was frequently thrown with eggs and stones. As a result, she had gone deranged and died while chasing away children on Halloween. She continued haunting away children with the form of the Monster House, while her husband was reluctant to destroy the house due to the deep-rooted love for her.

 The old owner of the house has a stroke at the beginning of the story, is assumed dead, but manages to combat his disease and come to the house at a critical moment. He realizes that the day is Halloween, that many children might be in danger of being eaten by the house. Therefore, he finally decides to join and help the children destroy the house with bombs from his previous demolishing occupation. They are successful and are ‘finally free’ from the haunting of the house, as mentioned by the old man.

&#x200B;

Feminism:

 At the start of the story, the babysitter who is obsessed with metal and goth invites his boyfriend over the house. The boyfriend is an obvious symbol of misogyny. He passionately kisses the doll of the protagonist after the child has mentioned that the doll is a ‘she’, hinting the over-sexualization of women. He acts aggressive towards the babysitter, who calls over his ‘no respect to women’. This is ironic as he, as a husband, should know more. This reflects misogyny problem of the United States and the world in whole. Many husbands are still prone to misogyny. In fact, the major stereotype of white male boomers is that they have a Facebook page claiming ‘I hate my wife.’ Such stereotype can be found across Reddit and Tumblr. It is indeed true that misogyny is rampant in rural areas and suburbs. The babysitter has broken up with the man at the end, meaning an explicit boundary against misogyny.

 The Monster House also reflects the status of women in this suburban of Milwaukee. The misogynic man throws a beer bottle to the lawn of Monster House, claiming that he is ‘not scared of’ her. It could be true that the man is not afraid of being eaten by the house, but he has already explicitly claimed that he does not believe in the human-eating house. Misogynists often feel that they are threatened by the rise of women. Eventually, the Monster House is infuriated by the man and eats him, which can be a twisted representation of feminism.

 To end the section of feminism, I have a refutable theory that the House represents feminism, which is seen as a threat by citizens at the village. After all, the house becomes a monster only due to villagers not respecting the woman. Women become angry and stage riots due to the disrespect and oppression. Feminism swallows misogyny, but regrettably also harms innocents. Finally, feminism is defeated, but also sows seeds for improvement. Such can be seen from the breaking up of the misogynist by the babysitter. The defeat of feminism also exposes other problems, such as police brutality and the resurgence of (weakened) misogyny. Such can be reflected by the villainous background music at the end while the police officers and the misogynist climb out of the havoc of the house.

&#x200B;

Police brutality and other problems concerning the police:

 The movie does not exactly cover police brutality, but instead is subtly shown along with other problems within the police community. The police officers arriving upon the call of the protagonists consist of a stereotypical male white cop with a big belly, along with a newly employed male black cop. The newly employed cop has shown unprofessional and rather inappropriate behaviour towards the children. Examples include shining a torch towards the eye of Jenny, the female protagonist, as well as pointing a loaded gun towards the children over merely childish behaviour. The same cop is also easily frightened. This reflects the lack of training of some police officers, leading to police brutality and the protests of 2020 in the United States.

Problematic behaviour of the police officers does not end here though. While inspecting the drugs being put in a device designated by the protagonists (as an attempt to ‘poison’ the House’, the white cop actually enjoys eating a drug and sips a whole tube of medicine. This reflects the serious drug addiction problem in some places of the United States. The fact that a police officer is having drugs is even more problematic. And towards the end of the movie, the two police officers actually have a conversation on having ‘candies’ and go trick-or-treat. ‘Candies’ is a slang for drugs. This is quite eye-opening as I was confused that adults are enthusiastically discussing about candies in the movie.

&#x200B;

Other details and conclusion:

Aside from police problems and feminism, there are also shady parts concerning the fat Ron-like protagonist Chowder. Starting from the light-hearted ones, Chowder mistakens uvula for uterus, therefore thinking that he does not have an uvula. This can mean that there is a lack of education in biology and the human body, leading to misunderstandings of the female body and even potentially disrespect. Quoting Chowder, while confronting with the police, he attempts to protect himself by saying that ‘My cousin’s a cop in Milwaukee. I mean, he’s kind of a cop… he’s got a gun.’ This can just mean that he has a pro-gun cousin, but for me, it means that Chowder has a gangster cousin. Gangs are prevalent in the United States, especially that Milwaukee is the largest city next to the notorious Chicago.

 This is my analysis of Monster House. Just a side note, I think I saw a scene in which branches of the trees to the side of Monster House resemble a Christian Cross. If so, it can act as a supplementary information that the Milwaukee suburb is religious. Since it is the trees of the Monster House, it is also possible that the creator of the movie Monster House has a negative view on religion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I LOVE YOUR ANALYSIS! I have always been left confused after listening to Laura Palmer and Falling. I also do not get why Weight of Living Pt.1 has so much reference, meanwhile I cannot find any connections to Weight of Living Pt.II . I have also been confused by the fusion of Laura Palmer and Overjoyed.

Extending the Weight of Living Pt.II further (I hope I would not grab away your future ideas. Ahh I am so excited. We have another analysis world here):

>All that you desired when you were a child was to be old, to be old. Now that you are here, suddenly you fear, you've lost control, you've lost control.

While growing up, we wish to improve ourselves and to improve the world. If we have toxic parents, then we might strive to avoid being 'just like our parents'. However after we have grown up, we still become our parents. We have lost control. So you can say that this song is from the perspective of Andrew. Perhaps there are other songs in perspective of Claire?

Losing control can also refer to losing control of the world. When I Watch the World Burn. I remember analyzing Final Hour as that Dan is actively combating climate change, but is the efforts futile at the end?

"Do you like the person you've become?" is basically "My god are we gonna be like our parents", but in a more generalized way.

"It's unavoidable", so it is the weight of LIVING, like generalizing that it is unavoidable for their lives to trace their parents' path and having their personalities twisted.



Now foward to Lethargy.

>The heart here encompasses a lot. It's their souls, their freedom, their choices, even their compassion for one another. It's something we see often, people have big dreams, but over time they settle into a groove and stay there. They no longer seek out interesting activities. They fall to the drudgery of daily life. In this, especially relating to this quote, they lose compassion for one another.

This is basically a description of lethargy. Get up, pressure, just do something, seek out interesting activities. Do not lose hope, do not be numb. Feel something.




And then it is a Four Walls reference?

>We could be born to anything, and now you, now you.

The pronoun "we" makes sense now. Originally it might be generalizing humans, that individuals have infinite futures. But then are WE gonna be like our parents. Providing that there is also the common theme of penalty (detention/death penalty), Four Walls can be a conversation between two out of Claire, Andrew, Allison and Bender. I really hope I can see Laura Palmer so I can understand more Bastille songs.

 This is also "Do you like the person you've become?". The weight of Living (alternatively, carrying the walls) now not only includes guilt and reflection, but also the realization that Perry Smith himself has changed.

Meanwhile, "your heart dies" can be applied into Four Walls, meaning that the artistic Perry Smith has lost compassion and hope.

I am now actually reading In Cold Blood, hoping to figure out more references. So I really hope I would not abandon the book halfway.




Finally, just adding the light/darkness element again. Light, as in Weight of Living Pt.I, is hope. So walking out into the dark not only refers to the unknown, but is also foreseeing that they are walking out into despair(You lean towards despair), because there is simply no hope in changing their rotten destiny of becoming just like their parents. It leads only to frustration and defeatism.

If we are to say that "Pumps through your veins" as drug reference, then I am reminded of Basement "Daddy was a junkie and found home in a needle filled with daily medicine". Or it can be alcoholism reference again, a common theme in BB. Then the chorus signifies fear. Why are we yet again indulging in escapism? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?



A whole new world of analysis, yayyyyy. I now get the significance of analyzing Laura Palmer, because this song is so important and so brilliantly done. And the connection to Basement through alcoholism also explains why Get Home is included. (I am looking foward to discussing the related song Basement) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I deeply sympathize with your situation and your thoughts. Being a Hong Konger/Chinese, the traditional values here are also strongly influenced by Confucianism, and my father has similar viewpoints. My family will also be supporting me financially through college. I have the additional trouble of convincing my mother against her beliefs in Christianity though. Hong Kong is a peculiar mixture of Chinese culture and Western individualism and liberalism. But at least it is easier to convince two people separately rather than to convince two strong-willed people with combined strength.

So now I am attempting to use traditional values to support gay rights. I know the suggestion of changing your parents' mindset is probably implausible at practice, but if your parents are calm enough and is against gayness due to intellection, I think this would be at least interesting.

Firstly it would be better to have a concrete understanding of the traditional belief. Confucianism is the main reason for the denial of gay people in China. Confucianism's core belief is compassion (仁),that even family compassion/fraternal duty/fial piety (孝) is originated from the core belief. According to Confucianism, a family is important because it is the foundation of the practice of compassion. It is important not merely for a bigger family or extending the bloodline, but more importantly for giving a place of comfort and a purpose in the future. To know more (which you might have known already), I have found [this analysis the most helpful.](http://【婚家專題】儒家為何要守護家庭？
https://www.hk01.com/article/105984?utm_source=01appshare&utm_medium=referral) It is in traditional Chinese though, but Google Translate can easily help if you need so.

According to my own analysis, disrespecting your children's decision in life and affecting the happiness of them is inconcilable to the core belief of compassion. When we view a belief, we should look through its core belief rather than the details. Details are just additional information because many people would not think about how to practice the core belief. In addition, there can be translation mistakes and intentional malicious attempts of twisting the details of a belief. However, a core belief can stay relevant and be spread accurately throughout time.

My another one to use traditional beliefs for supporting gay rights is the use of [a passage that I could not find the translation in English] 魏禧 「人各以得行其智為適」. The passage means that the best approach is to let people choose their own paths and use their own belief in life. While there are some parts of this one are about choice, something that being gay is not, this can temporarily suit their mindset, and educate them in the future. If you can follow compassion, the core belief, in your own way, then why not do so? Do we all need family as the basis for support? While I cannot speak for everyone, friends can be a new way of finding support. Slashing your way foward individually can be difficult, but it is still somewhat plausible.

Reputation though also goes against Confucianism in a confusing way. 君子病無能焉，不病人之不己知也. A noble person only worries of his own abilities, rather than how others perceive himself.

事父母幾諫 During family duty, a person should patiently and civilly lead their parents to the right path if the parents have been wrong. So if your parents refuse conversation even after they have calmed themselves down, you can remember this.

Unfortunately, I still know this is implausible because modern China has already twisted the traditional beliefs. Putting economy in front of justice, for example, is exactly 萬鍾則不辯禮義而受之 and 失其本心. For a more pragmatic approach, immigration is one of the final resorts. Normally I would suggest going to Britain or Australia, but who knows what the leader is going to do to immigrants (of course Britain with the exception of BNO, HK). As someone has mentioned before, perhaps living in Hong Kong or Taiwan would be better. Taiwan has legal gay marriage, another win. I have to clarify that homophobia is more prevalent than what Westerners would think in both places, but is definitely less prevalent than in Nebraska, I believe.

Just to let you know that things will be better. Your worries are valid, your feelings are valid, your approaches to express emotions are valid. Crying is acceptable, gayness is normal and should be embraced. (Sorry if I am headache-inducing) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Narrated by David Attenborough

I love David Attenborough. He uses a lot of prose reading skills, and I am thoroughly impressed by him. Sorry that I couldn't resist making this comment. Like sex and reproduction are also parts of biology and are technically in the scope of his study (ignoring that he focuses more on the nature side). AND he works at BBC (as in broadcast).

I am glad that I am innocent enough to think of British Broadcasting Cooperation when encountering the word BBC, rather than the oversexualization and stereotypes of black men in gay relationships. And let us also thank BBC company for their neutral and high-quality news. I wish to have more of such news stations in Hong Kong aside of RTHK (which has a British background). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Free your mind and join us~you can feel it in the air (Of the Night)

Set me free from my jealousy (Send Them Off!)

Also,

>If I could wear your clothes, I'd pretend I was you

Sleeping in the clothes you love, it's such a shame we had to see them burn (Good Grief)

Is there something deeper here? Like some other connections?

One thing I could think of is that it offers another perspective for Of the Night, that relationships turn from an exciting thing to merely a routine. Like joining the dissatisfied spouses.

Another could be adding to this Don't Let Go by adding the background, that the relationship deterioated due to jealousy.

This song might yet again add to the relationship theme, contributing to the storyline. Yet I am too busy studying for my exam. (Volcanic eruption is explosive diarrhea?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> 'I am' is a kind of self-labelling that insinuates an irrevocable situation. For the 'I am depressed' statement, it can be converted to "I was diagnosed with depression, but the term depression just a way doctors use to give us better treatment. It does not mean that I will be depressed forever. I can take steps to alleviate the effects of it eventually, even that it is hard."

For social awkwardness, "I can be anxious upon meeting people, but I succeeded in asking a girl out! This proves that I am NOT a socially awkward person. I may just have bad days in the past, and now I need to acknowledge my progress and continue to improve myself."

Self-labelling such as being depressed and socially awkward is a trap that many have fallen into. Your social awkwardness does not define you, no matter in the future or even at present. At worst, it can gradually lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. But once you avoid it, things can actually improve.

Just to add: Things will be better once you take steps towards your goal. It will be hard, and there will be off-days. However that would not stop you from succeeding. We are all in this together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is one of my favourite songs in OPH2. It serves mainly as a continuation of What Would You Do, but the lyrics of this song is less explicit. When you know this song is related to What Would You Do, you know this analysis is a trigger warning.

>I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money
I'll do what you want me to do
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money
And any old music will do

Reading the lyrics of the chorus would make it easier to understand. The narrator is from a 'private dancer'. The use of private indicates that this job is not an admirable job, that it has to be hidden from view. There will be other explanations, but the word dancer even makes it more palpable that the narrator is a prostitute or more specifically, a pole dancer. Pole dancing can be a beautiful art form, but is stigmatized as a form of prostitution. Dancer for money indicates the reason why the narrator chooses the job. "I'll do what you want me to do" has a tragically submissive tone, while 'any old music will do' might be giving a hint that the narrator does not enjoy the job very much. She (prostitutes are often, but not necessarily always, a woman)

>All the men come in these places
And the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces
And you don't ask their names

>You don't think of them as human
You don't think of them at all
You keep your mind on the money
Keeping your eyes on the wall

"These places", for me, carries somewhat a negative connotation. Like they are from the worst parts of slums, from the worst gangs. They are 'all the same', like they are just as bad as one another. They have done enough to traumatize others, and they are too lust-driven. No point in looking at their faces, look at their faces or even treat them as humans, because a relationship with them would never end up well. Abusive relationships? Bad Blood/Forever Ever? (We used to hurt his flesh just to see if he could feel)

Money. A sad reality. A catalogue of modern mistakes (Oil on Water), because many prostitutes are forced into their career due to economic difficulties.

>I wanna make a million dollars
I wanna live out by the sea
Have a husband and some children
Yeah, I guess I want a family

Another emphasis that the narrator only chooses the job because of economic desires. She wants to start a 'normal' life (as defined by traditional family beliefs). But the strange thing is that 'I guess' insinuates that she is also somewhat reluctant. Like she is traumatized by her experiences with men, that speaking of family does not exactly excites her. She is simply torn apart between her feelings and the traditional social expectations of women~raising a family, having a child.

>When I hold you baby
Feel your heart beat close to me
Wanna stay in your arms forever

>Only love can set you free
When I wake each morning
And the storm beats down on me
And I know we belong together
Only love can set you free

If the above analysis all makes sense, then this part would be quite confusing. Why 'You don't look at their faces', and suddenly 'wanna stay in your arms forever'? Perhaps although the narrator is traumatized, she feels desparately alone and starves physical intimacy. The trauma leads to isolation, amplifying the loneliness. Or perhaps this is said by the customers, which explains the choice of putting Dan's vocals here.

Now let us make things complicated. It starts with 'keeping your eyes on the wall'. It speaks of the narrator convincing herself to focus the attention on the metaphorical wall, that they can never be together, like Oil on Water. I thought this might be related to idioms, so I searched on Google and found a landscape book on Palestinian Landscapes. Indeed, walls are not just a metaphor of separation, it has been around in history. Berlin Wall, West Bank Barrier Wall, Trump Mexican Wall.

With this theme, the song can also make sense, especially the last part. The narrator is a pole dancer near the boundary. The song speaks of suspicion on the other side of the wall. Efforts of dehumanizing the 'enemies', emphasizing how inhumane they are. The narrator deals with the other side only because they are an important source of income. But then she gradually breaks the wall, and realizes that only love between the two sides can set them free from conflicts.

Storm beats down on me. Water, symbolizing distance and weight of living. Perhaps also about the Red Sea? But in any perspective, this song is quite tragically beautiful. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Personally I have seen related comments (not posts) before. Someone will ask on how to meet gays when they are in rural areas. There will always be people answering Grindr. Then there are posts about having a one-night stand or hookup with a handsome gay, then there will be comments on 'lucky you'.

Notice how these examples are not explicitly talking about hookups and unprotected sex though. Grindr, though I personally do not like it, is sometimes perceived as a hookup app, but it can still be used to meet gays for long-term relationships. People in the comments can just be saying that the OP is lucky to meet a handsome gay and have sex with him. And other than those, I have never seen a post nor a comment encouraging unprotected sex.

But do we need to explicitly discourage people from having hookups and unprotected sex? Yes. This, I believe, is the aim of OP. This format of first criticising the prevalence of encouraging hookups and unprotected sex can catch the attention of people, but it also misguides people into questioning whether there are such posts here. Nevertheless, this post can serve as a wake-up call for some oblivious gays while encouraging more posts educating on AIDS pandemic, use of condoms, and benefits of having long-term relationships rather than hookups. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If you have to maximize your karma, it is hard work that requires a lot of nonsense skills. I do not follow them and even intentionally break some of the following rules:

1. Active participation in subreddits, make more comments and posts, particularly posts

2. Examine the hive mind and echo chamber within the respective subs. Post and comment meeting the consenus opinion. For example, comment anti-police and pro-police abortion content in r/BadCopsNoDonuts

3. Tone varies in different subreddits. For r/politics , just be as angry as possible in regards to American-centric problems (eg racism, BLM). For r/politicaldiscussion , however, always use passive voice, a civil tone.

4. Echo chamber varies in different sections of the comment section. No commentary in controversial comments. Avoid commenting separately if there are already a lot of comments. You do not know how to suit the tastes of the audience, and it is likely to be buried in new. The best option is to directly comment in best comments and suit the tone and opinion of the respective commenter. You can try to comment if you see a potentially popular postx but this can be risky. You either get a karma boost or a karma disaster.

5. Join 'Nice' threads in popular subs. Breaking the thread will be risky. You either get lots of karma or be downvoted to oblivion.

6. Label trigger warnings, NSFW, gore, violence and spoilers.

7. Suit content with respective audience. You would not want to make a NSFW r/nosleep story on r/divorcedbirds or r/birding

8. You can POST misleading content, but you cannot COMMENT misleading content, since many Redditors use comment sections as a lazy fact check method. Pointing put the misleading content in the post would be risky, but adding some more observations in the person who point out the misleading content would be great. Label trustworthy and neutral sources if plausible.

9. Join popular subreddits and actively participate in them.

10. No emojis throughout Reddit. For most popular subs, use English with perfect grammar but in the form of short texts.

11. If you are being downvoted, do not try to comment further and explain. You will only get even more downvotes.

12.  Rick-rolling on subreddits with young Redditors would be fun. Also sex jokes such as 69.

13. No discussion on music on subreddits like r/AskReddit . A total disaster. No popular songs, including Bohemian Rhapsody and especially Bohemian Rhapsody. You can try commenting niche songs with rich history element such as Court of the Crimson King. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you for responding. I joined this sub with the intention to suggest the discouraging downvoting thing, before I saw this post.

I believe a sticky post will help. I think people might look at the sticky before participating (with the exception of r/all or r/popular threads) because it is convenient to take a glimpse at a sticky with just a few words. Many people might be reluctant to see the rules because they really have to intentionally look for the rules to see them in mobile. And if this measure is ineffective, at least it shows the stance of the subreddit. If this measure is to be used, then the title should be as short as possible, such as "Downvotes don't change views" as you mentioned.

Or what about designing a new downvote button? Like we can make the downvote button become the background colour to subtly show a discouragement. Or perhaps an emoji of a thinking button 🤔 can be used. It is to show doubt of the decision of downvoting, and to also show reservation (instead of a total offense) to the opinion of the person being downvoted. I have to admit I do not know how this works though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have so many questions on the song. From BB (excluding ATBB), WW and DD, I would expect the last song from an album to deliver some kind of connection to other albums. I would also expect this song to deliver some kind of emotion as a conclusion. But it turns out to fade out at Skulls?

When I first heard Tuning Out, I laughed out loud at the transition from the angelic Oh Holy Night to the somewhat demonic-sounding version of Skulls. It is so hilariously unexpected. It is also fun to see people hearing their favorite song that they thought they could sing along, and it turns out to end in such an unusual way.

But anyway, why would the song connect Oh Holy Night and Skulls. It seems very strange, because the Christmas song is about birth, while Skulls is about death. They should be polar opposites. Is it that the two people in Skulls use religion as an anchor to their new reality? And this religious connection woulf then link to the religious/cult theme in WW?

I am not exactly a Christmas song hater, but Bastille made me listen to his versions of Christmas songs throughout the whole year. The Christmas mashup with Hankey the Christmas poo is another perfect Christmas song from Bastille, and I couldn't stop myself from listening to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally disagree that neither sides are actively harming democracy. Like you have said, Republicans have been pushing some undemocratic reforms foward. However, I believe this is not what OP is focusing on (This is a problem in CMV, because people who post have to use extremely accurate wordings to get thr conversation in an desirable direction). It is that we still have to accept people of different views, including 'anti-democracy' ones, in order to establish a concrete foundation for democracy. Democracy can be interpreted in many different ways, perhaps Republicans just have a different democracy standard in their minds, or that they are unaware of what their actions would cause to democracy. We cannot actually know the intentions of our opponents. Perhaps they are misinformed or have a different idea in their heads. It is unfair to say that we support democracy, when we still antagonize people who disagree with us on democracy.

Under a democractic society, all points of view should be accepted. I know you might counter my argument with Nazis, and this is definitely a valid argument. However simply antagonizing others without constructive conversation would still be harmful to democracy, because we should still be respectful of people with different opinion, then figure out which one suits our views of what is correct. Ideally, we should focus on changing other's mind through debates, but not just antagonizing others. A concrete democracy is established through understanding different people's views ,and challenging others as well as our own belief.

I do not live in the US, so I do not technically have a superiority to comment on US politics. But of course, democracy is an important topic around the world. I know this might not be very convincing to you, because I am still young, naive and admittedly not knowing very deeply of politics around the world. </TEXT>

I have not been a fan of these dance/electric/EDM songs since I listened to Chopin and Bastille, but this one is quite refreshing. When I listen to it, it feels like billions of stars on the nightsky dancing and colliding, and I, merely as a peasant looking towards heaven and struggling with friendships, am dancing with the stars and moons. It is a beautiful escapment from reality, before letting me plummet to the harsh truth once again. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do not really choose gay people to be friends with, but rather that I am drawn to GRSM unaware. I do not really have a close relationship (as in friendship) with anyone, but one of my most familiar acquaintances are bisexual, and aonther one is asexual, and finally one is at least supportive of the community (whom I suspect to be gay, but judging from personality is really nonsense).

The largest difference between gays and straights that I have spotted is that straights have quite a lot of microaggressions to gays. Using gay as a slur, or pretending to be gay for fun in a derogatory way. And I am not interested in talking about girls all day long. Magnify all of this in terms of teenage stupidity/naivety, and you get how boys in my school are.

I am into politics but I cannot stand people who are so cynical at the world, shouting at TV, shaming politicians every day. Amazed that people can actually have the energy to be furious.

I have no idea what the gay culture is. If it is drag shows and gay bars, then probably I am too young to hear about them from my peers. Pop and hookup? No.

Feeling alienated is probably one of the definitions of being gay, unfortunately I believe. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am so late that only r/Tsreuvers would look at this. Busy at school, you know. But here you go.

>I'm lost but found with you, in a bed that we'll never make
It's a feeling we always chase

In Divide it is 'lost AND found', which emphasizes both lost (confusion of love) and found (renewed the sense of hope). Meanwhile, this song is 'lost BUT found', which emphasizes found and the hope rather than the confusion. There is an escalation in the lyrics.

The bed thing, on the other hand, could be just about being too hurried to make their bed, or knowing that they will separate and have no willingness of making their bed. It could be about being so focused on each other that they have no will in tidying up their mess, or it could be about forgetting their flaws, mistakes, and mess that they made (Flaws) by embracing each other.

>fantasies
Just call this what it is, we don't pretend it's real

Wow, I mean. There is so much emotional impact here.

>So don't make promises to me that you're gonna break
We only ever wanted one thing from this
Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away
We only ever wanted one thing from this

Beautiful. Stunning lyrics. Really depicts the unwillingness of separating from each other. And painting wonderful lies is such an amazing metaphor.

>Oh, in another place
In another time, what could we have been?

These lines, together with the beautiful ones above, is what I frequently think about during 2019 protests. If we are not in Hong Kong, will our demands be met? Will we actually succeed? (National Security Law: Yeah I definitely do not support HK independence. Look through my profile, and you will see that I have spotted many implausible aspects of independence, including energy resources)

>Feels like something's special but it never felt like love
Wonder what we could be living in another life
Catch us in the mirror and it looks a lot like love
Then you stop me talking as you kiss me from above

ahhh I mean. The top/bottom thing, the Spiderman thing and the hope/despair thing mixing together. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have noticed so many similarities with lyrics of other Bastille songs. Is this trying to sum up the whole process from Bad Blood theme to escapism?

>This gonna be a heavy night
Way too many dricks, ain't me even start it

>This is just another night, and we've had many of them.
To the morning we're cast out, but I know I'll land here again.

Alcoholism as common theme. Btw Bad Decisions sounds like a reference to Get Home here?

>Never need to apologize
We already know we're far from perfect

Transition from Flaws (BB) to Glory (WW)

>I fall to the curb
You laugh till it hurts
Who cares? We've been here so many times

>And drunk we set the world to rights as we fell and hit our heads upon the curb. You made me laugh until I die, can you think of any better way to choke?

This should be pretty obvious. This song quite emphasizes the theme of alcoholism and friendship, while Glory subtly brings out the meaning of perfectionism and activism as well. "here" can refer to failure in activism, the negative effects of alcohol, laughing too hard and choking. It can even refer to all the bad decisions in real life, so that the narrator wishes to escape from reality.

>We're all stumbling through the night
It doesn't matter, we're all together
And it's paradise in our minds
Falling together, arms round each other

Mixing BB and DD here. Get Home literally talks about stumbling through the night. However night can also refers to challenges and adversities in life. Then there are two lines of embracing friends and families (the famiglia), "falling" into escapism together. I think "paradise in our minds" is referencing to two songs. One is Glory for its perfectionism theme (but it doesn't make sense here?). The other should be one Bad Blood song. My first thought is the Silence.

>And carrying the world is overrated

In Bad Blood, one of the narrators carry the weight of living, the albatross, the guilt. This can be a subtle reference to the songs. Then carrying the world also refers to having an information overload from seeing all the news. "Never good, just the bad and the ugly"(Warmth). Or it can refer to trying to change the world for the better, "And drunk we set the world to rights". Overrated reflects a disagreement to these attitudes, meaning that the author either wishes to escape responsibility (less likely), or escape from carrying all the heavy news, delving into escapism instead. Overrated also reflects that the narrator notices a large number of people being too focused on world issues (politics).

Now I have noticed some rather confusing parts. Why "In the middle, I'm steady on my feet" and "stumbling through the night"? It seems to be contradictory, unless they are talking about totally different things? Well, in the middle can refer to being surrounded by friends, so that the narrator can walk properly while drunk, because others are helping him. Stumbling through the night can refer to challenges in life rather than unstable feet movement. But as I love to make things complicated, my first thought is that "middle" refers to neutrality in politics. Meanwhile, "steady" is like "deep red/deep blue states", as opposed to "swing voters". This can mean that the narrator refuses to give any commentary to politics, because he doesn't care about it anymore. Carrying the world is overrated.

And finally, if this song is a linkage and introduction to Doom Days and escapism, then the clock thing in the audio video might not just be an artistic consideration. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thank you! Sorry that I am not participating much~ my overthinking exceeds my willingness to post. I guess I am more of a commenter rather than someone who posts.

(yet again being off-topic in the following paragraphs)

For Another Place, I did not think of spiderman, but I interpret it as Dan being a bottom in a gay relationship. In addition, "Kiss me from above" sounds like kissing from heaven, so this reflects that Dan is in bliss while kissing or during the relationship. There is also a probability that Dan maybe just put above because it sounds more catchy.

For Million Pieces, the capitalization reminds me of a song my classmate/friend loves, the Court of the Crimson King. I did not like the errie sound of the song, but the theme is very interesting with a lot of symbolizations and metaphors. The song is anti-Cold War, criticizing aspects such as the loss of lives, puppet governments established by both sides, and chasing the impossible dream of stopping the hypothetical enemy of communism.

With this perspective, I would think of the hope of erasing social division in Divide, like urging governments of different ideology to collaborate. At the same time, I would think of the 1984 reference of WW album. The hypocritical regime manipulating citizens by propaganda. These points are similar to the Court of the Crimson King.

Let us extend this further to Nocturnal Creatures.

>We received the freedom but we were completely unaware what to do with this freedom. It felt like the hungry people received the foods and we just ate everything.

This reflects the situation of Russians after Cold War or the collapse of USSR, which is indulging in Western entertainment and not progressing in political development (eg concrete establishments of democracy and freedom). Take note of the years. 1930s, rise of fascism and populism, potential reference of Fake It. Personality cult, potential reference of Blame cult in the music video. Rise of Trump due to populism. 1955-1975, Vietnam War, theme of Court of the Crimson King, while having Kubrick's Hollywood. 1984, the name of the novel as a year, referenced by WW album. 1991, fall of USSR, end of Cold War, Nocturnal Creatures. Is Doom Days Album is not only based on the chronological order of events at the party, but also years of history? That this is a continuation of the WWII/Cold War theme by extending it to the rise of escapism afterwards? Am I overthinking?

Quarter Past Midnight (climate change): Roman Empire (which is why there are so many Roman and Greek references in Bastille songs?), Industrial Revolution, present rapid global warming?

Joy: Fully immersing in escapism, leading to political apathy and disconnection? That eventually things will become better (eg technological advancements after Cold War), but due to us not contributing and escaping, we make the same mistakes again and lead us to another apocalypse?

Kool-aid: Nazis, Fascists, propaganda from Cold War countries, notably USSR and the US, and finally maybe Trump.

History repeats itself, that is why we have the song Bad Decisions "So we'll make the same mistakes till the morning breaks".

I kept thinking about how strangely simple and straightforward this album is, with less connections to other albums. Am I overthinking over all of this? Perhaps history (satirizing the present with the past) is a crucial element of Doom Days. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have been discussing politics with my family, and we are concerned of Hong Kong's importance to China. Hong Kong has been very important because it is the bridge to the western world. Now that China has already asserted dominance on the industry and product/machine-making (eg mask diplomacy), does China need Hong Kong. Or is Hong Kong simply a burden that could pose risks to the authoritarian rule? From the recent national security law, it seems that China does not really care about the potential percussions from international response.And it is harrowing because if China does not care about public reception, then China can actually may as well do another 4th June massacre.

Now it seems that the international society may need Hong Kong more than China does. Hong Kong has a key position in the international financial market with the time zone, but there can be other replacements such as Singapore or Shanghai. With the 2019 protests affecting HK economy, Hong Kong's economic importance and financial centre position is lowered. This can be good news for China and bad news for Hong Kong, as PRC can have one more excuse of asserting more control on Hong Kong, securing this Achilles Heels. But overall I really have no idea if this is conducive or devastating to Hong Kongers, I only know that there really is a huge impact.

After talking off-topic again, I am yet dragging the topic back to what you mentioned. If Hong Kong has already lost some financial centre influence from the protests, will Hong Kong be less important to the international market as well? Hard to say. The pandemic poses some more variables, especially that Hong Kong is less hit by COVID-19 than other financial centres such as New York or London. It also seems that distrust of western countries towards China has heightened as well. Hong Kong can be used as a bargaining chip against China. Perhaps this can benefit Hong Kong?

I am not that optimistic though. No matter which solution, whether it is returning to PRC, retaining one country two systems, going to Taiwan or US, or finally this scenario. No matter which scenario, Hong Kong still relies on others in many ways. Hong Kong is a twisted mixture and treasure of eastern influence clashing with western influence, or democracy vs authoritarianism, or China vs US, or hub of international resources, or the ecologically important estuary position, or even hexagonal columnar volcanic tuff. Then this is added with some diligence and intelligence of Hong Kongers. Perhaps Hong Kong really will continue to go on her weird mixture pathway and develop in an unexpected and novel way that has never seen before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also do not think they are the band's personal opinion. (I couldn't resist analyzing the song)

The most important clue is "it's a catalogue of modern mistakes". Keywords that I have ignored before: catalogue. It can be meant as "A series of unwelcome or unpleasant things". So why series? I have said that it is related to extreme capitalism forcing the existence of sex workers, like the materialism over the emphasis of "body dignity", and the lack of social mobility. Sex work also involves some unpleasant businesses, including human trafficking or high risk of rape and sexual diseases. With these concerns, people would view like "She is someone's daughter. Why won't she respect her own body, when her parents might be heartbroken?"

Then I think oil on water does not only mean the position, and the unmatchable customers and sex workers. Perhaps it is also about oxygen unable to dissolve in water due to oil (oops using biology terms). In other words, the reality is suffocating. It might not even be a coincidence that water, the key metaphor of internal struggles, is used in the title. The chorus might be other's comments and judgements, while the verses are descriptions of different processes of the job. Then oil on water might also be used as describing some viewing that sex workers are seeking fulfillment and escapism from their struggles through sex. I am not sure on this one, but is the usage of water really a coincidence? (Oops off-topic. Mega ultra off topic.) </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the above passages, I mainly focus on the plausibility of suggestions, public reception in particular. The first energy source I could think of is wind energy, since there are already wind power plants on Lamma Island. It is possible to bring in technology for wind energy development swiftly. If wind energy is developed, then solar power is also likely to be developed.

I bet that UN or any other temporary/permanent ruler would be extremely cautious on public approval, if HK has such an ability of making things into a mess. The first few decades is crucial. If HK resists UN, then there will almost be no solutions. Nuclear energy is proven to be very controversial around the world, including HK. HK has been a bit repulsed by the nuclear power plants within the range of 50km. What would happen if nuclear energy is used? There is a risk of riots, which is detrimental to every side. It would be unwise to propose such controversial solution upon a short time of power transfer.

Tidal power plant, I shall admit, is an unfamiliar territory for me. There are no tidal power plants near Hong Kong. From Wikipedia, tidal power plants require 8m difference in tidal level. Does Hong Kong have such difference in tidal levels? I really have no idea. Hong Kong today has a difference of 2.5m in maximum, but a day's reference is not enough, and the figure is already generously given.

I really would not give high hopes on sustainable energy development in HK though. HK is an international financial district, so if we are to increase the ratio of sustainable energy in energy consumption, we face risks of either higher cost, public disapproval, and/or critical economic loss when a power cut occurs. This would not be allowed under the economic-emphasizing PRC or HKSAR.

If we are talking about environmental problems, I have just realized yet another one, which is waste disposal. There are no landfills in the area, so what would happen? Continue to transport wastes to landfills despite potential exploitation of Guangdong Province by high transportation fee? An incinerator? If incinerators are to be used, then where should it be put? Cyberport? </TEXT>

<TEXT> In this case where Hong Kong is reduced to Kowloon and the island, I believe there will be a huge push for reclamation. More specifically, there will be a whole new area of development with the reclamation in To Kwa Wan Typhoon Shelter. The advantage of developing the area is quite tremendous. If we are talking about the potential industrial redevelopment, then extending the minor industrial land in Ma Tau Kok would be beneficial. If we are talking about the airport, this piece of land has a proximity to the narrow strip of land of Kai Tak. With this perspective, To Kwa Wan Typhoon Shelter will be reduced in size or even eliminated. The replacement would almost definitely be located between Nam Cheong and Ngong Shuen Chau. However, the same site can also be used as industrial land given the proximity to Cheung Sha Wan industrial district and the easiness of reclamation.

The drawback of these reclamation projects is that they reduce the area of the Victoria Harbour. According to Basic Law, reclamation cannot be carried out along Victoria Harbour unless with absolute necessity. The projects are likely to meet the criteria. What Hong Kongers would concern on reclamation is the ecological impacts. Victoria Harbour has not much ecological importance due to rapid urbanization and pollution. I would deem reclamation in UN HK as plausible.

A brand new airport (excluding Kai Tak where airport has been developed before) though? Not likely. The costs are tremendously high given that almost no spare land is in the area. There can be an airport near Cyberport, but is it necessary after Kai Tak airport is expanded?

If we are talking about the current Hong Kong, HK always has huge resistance against reclamation, with examples of Lantau Tomorrow Vision and HK International Airport Master plan 2030. The proposed land is located in sites with huge ecological values, costs a ton and has questionable necessity of construction and effectiveness. Chek Lap Kok in particular is in a close proximity to two marine parks, affecting the ecological systems there.

If we are talking about small Hong Kong as in the map, it is inevitable to carry out large reclamation. But if we are talking about HKSAR/PRC HK, there will be quite some resistance. Nevertheless, the plans are insisted, with Chek Lap Kok one is already in process. Bitterly saying, no push is needed. Industrial redevelopment is implausible under HKSAR with the government's conservative approach.


I almost forgot energy production and water resources! Very important. I believe Hong Kong will have a desalting plant in To Kwa Wan with reference to Lok On Pai Desalting Plant. Tai Tam Harbour can be a new reservoir with reference to the construction of Plover Cove Reservoir. Energy production will be UN HK's Achilles Heel. There is almost no plausible and stable energy source. The smartest solution is a wind power plant near Ng Fan Chau, with the long fetch and wind duration. However we all know wind energy is very unstable. Then eventually China will have more influence on HK politics, which poses risk to UN HK or any other solutions aside from returning to China. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I guess that the quite unused cruise terminal is demolished so that Kai Tak airport would be built again. The cruise terminal might have a higher risk of being abandoned after the pandemic, given how easily diseases can spread on a cruise in Covid-19.

This method would be costly but beneficial even if the status quo is remained, meaning that if Kowloon/HKIsland is returned to China's control. As such an important international financial centre and having a rich ecology around Chek Lap Kok, reducing the reliance of the current airport can be conducive for Hong Kong's development. Not to mention it can relieve the pressure of the main highway on Lantau Island without really using resources to expand the transportation network there. Many cities, Paris as an example, have two airports as well. One for international flights, another for flights within the country and nearby countries.

Nevertheless, is the small airport enough for this UN Hong Kong? Perhaps yes, and perhaps not. After 2019 protests, pandemic, 2020 protests, Hong Kong Massacre and the loss of a free market state, Hong Kong's development in the future is unknown given the instability not being conducive to business development. However, the blow of the pandemic is not very serious to HK as compared with many other places, notably New York and London.

If businesses lose confidence and relocate from Hong Kong, how should Hong Kong develop? This one is tricky. There are almost no natural resources, tourism is proven to be an unstable source of income, it is difficult to return yet again to the industry-based development as limited by the lack of industrial area (except perhaps Cheung Sha Wan, in which there are almost no real industrial development there. Tseung Kwan O has an industrial district, but can it be relied?). Technology, perhaps? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Everytime I see "dyke", I am reminded of geology.

(Trying to use correct geology concepts while suiting the atmosphere here. A geography quiz tomorrow)

Strong hydraulic action repeatedly hits the shore with dykes. As the dykes are less resistant (to erosion), a crack is formed. Then it is enlargened by pressure to become a hole, then a notch, then a sea cave. As hydraulic action continues, the hole penentrates through the headland, forming a sea arch. Finally, the overhanging part of the sea arch could not resist the gravity pull and collapses, forming a sea stack. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are a whole lot of definition of right. A very liberal country may have a conservative party that is leaning left for the US. Not to mention that are a lot of axis to consider in "right". Broadly speaking, GRSM rights is about social justice (left) vs social conservatism (right) , but there are also the economic axis, the global (left?) vs individual(right?) axis, the scientific (left?) vs science skepticism/tradition (right?) axis, etc.

It is true that gays are capable of hate, including homophobia. However the most conservative countries and parties would not allow a gay man to be the leader. They would just oppress him in spite of his stances. They may report him and throw stones at him, regardless that he is homophobic as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe Glory, Flaws and Fake It are the core Bastille songs.
They are all about relationships on the surface, but actually talks about politics. They reflect Bastille's values and stances on issues subtly. They all have a lot of connections with other songs and can be described metaphorically as a 'transportation hub'. All of them, especially Fake It, hides a serious theme under the rather cheerful instrumentals. Glory also reflects the attitude of escapism as well.

Four Walls might also be a choice. It shows that Bastille does not shy away from politics and solemn topics such as death penalty. It also demonstrates how Bastille references poetry. Those Nights shows that Bastille can nail the usage of instrumentals, especially the strings.

For music videos, Blame would be a good example of how weird Bastille's videos can be, while not going to the extreme example of Torn Apart. Blame also covers the several interpretation perspective characteristic of Bastille songs.

And the mention of core metaphors, water and fire, should also be included in the general Bastille song list. The Silence would be a good example, especially that it covers the theme of mental illness as well. Oil on Water mentioned water, but it is unknown if this is a metaphor for struggles as well. Perhaps it is, about the choking reality of not being able to get by (catalogue of modern mistakes). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, Divide is not really the best work of Bastille. I think Divide is written in the pre-Bastille period of Dan, so it explains why the lyrics are more repetitive and simple. It also explains why Divide has simple instrumentals, not even including bass or electric guitars, or violins or drums.

Regardless of the lyrics and the repetition, I still love the song because it sounds so genuine and raw. Like Divide's surface meaning is about feeling alone and and not wanting others to leave the party. And the loneliness of Dan with only his piano seems to reflect this scene. It is actually the first song that I liked in Doom Days album (excluding the extra tracks) This is because at that time the social division in my hometown was very serious, and I did not really take time to notice the deeper meaning in other Bastille songs like Fake It then.

Many people became a Stormer because of Dan's voice, and I bet the song provided them with one of the best and clearest vocals. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are multiple meanings in the song, aside from the relationship aspect.

The first one would be about Brexit. Why would Britain and EU divide, when they could come together and solve conflicts between them instead?

The second one would be social division. Why would we divide and put one against the other, when we could collaborate assertively and maintain a true peace, when we could actually listen to one another's perspectives and keep an open mind?

The third one would be a hypocritical ruler seeking to maintain "peace" without actually doing anything to resolve conflicts and look at the causes. Won't let the public opinion go like this, won't let the nation go like this. Everyone just shut up and obey the absolute rule. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I agree that feeling defeated and frustrated are some causes of being more conservative overtime. I understand your situation, and unfortunately, I am also noticing that I am becoming gradually more conservative overtime. Which is pretty bad as I should be an angry teenager right now. I shouldn't be conservative, not now. I should be following my peers' political stances, or my liberal parents'.

However I doubt that feeling defeated is the only cause. I have quite some explanations here. (So this is the hint that you should skip the comment if you do not want to feel uncomfortable on challenging your belief. Or that you are not in the mood of seeing an essay on something that is made up of theories and that might be irrelevant to your life. Sometimes we are just having an albatross on our necks, that we cannot handle more information and thinking. And it is valid.What I am tired of seeing is that one could only downvote without constructively pointing out problems. Of course it is just a way of some to release their suppressed anger, sometimes with influences of herd mentality.)

What is wrong with your analogy is that you would feel that it makes sense to you, but there would be no connections for others. Like r/therightcantmeme , leftists might not understand the mindsets of the right, therefore not understanding their jokes.

Note that I do not support defeatism even though I sympathize with those who feel defeated.

I am now briefly mentioning some explanations I have seen in the comments. Staying updated on being progressive (great one here). And also seeing more perspectives and being too tired to feel anger (Very enlightening to me- indeed emotional exhaustion can hinder one from challenging their views and adopting the new political landscape, or even from feeling angry). I will add some more new points and explain further on these points.

And then note the generalization. Not all people are..., and it is true. I am just emphasizing this here, then not going to mention it later. So this is what I support in OP. You cannot define other's future, that everyone is going to be conservative.

Firstly we might be ignorant as children. The world is beautiful, especially for those not having family, financial, physical or mental issues (rare, huh?). We feel hopeful for the future. Nevertheless, we might be affected by our parents' or teachers' points of view, which is a divergent point.

Then as we reach adolescence, we realize the world is not perfect. Still feeling hopeful, we try our best to change the world for the better. And as we are still not experienced or exposed to more people, we can be trapped in our echo chambers, amplifying the radical sides of our minds. We might become more radical and progressive, especially with the generalization that "teens are rebellious and emotional, possibly hypersensitive". Or, as I prefer, "teens are generally, but not always, innovative, empathetic, and are good at embracing their emotions."

Okay. After that with some shocking events, we realize the importance for seeing more perspectives, and truly accepting and embracing them. But not thinking of ways to refute these hypothetical enemies. We learn more about the world, about politics that we have ignored. This is where we throw away some palpably illogical mindsets. This is where we leave our bubbles, see more of the world and possibly become less radical. This is where we are at our best. This is where we are still hopeful but are more mature. This is generally the stage where the most successful activists are at, with their ability of changing people's minds.

Great, until everything goes downhill. We accumulate more experiences as we look up for our heaven. We realize that everything, even the "perfect systems", comes with a price. Almost every solution arises a problem. The problem grows larger overtime due to being ignored. Then some young people, possibly, would point that out. A solution is adopted, which gives rise to another problem. "If this is the case, then why change? We are all going to screw up anyway."

Take socialism as an (imperfect) example. The working class are overjoyed that they are potentially leaving their oppressed states produced by the richest capitalists. What happens then? Socialism is manipulated into authoritarianism in some places. It is misunderstood, and made poverty grow (They might ignore the other factors due to confirmation bias.) "Why change, when something we have high hopes in turns out to suck so badly?" Defeatism grows, and it spreads to other areas.

Some more factors are at play at that stage, and some more novel and old theories. We become busier and more emotionally drained. No time to put anger into social issues, giving arise to political apathy. With the drained state, it is difficult to change our views at the stage, or even read more information to escape our echo chambers. Also, we might not be able to adapt to the rapidly changing world, and our progressive views slowly turn into conservative mindsets.

There is another unique theory of mine on us against our biological nature. The survival of only the fittest. What does it sound like on a humanitarian view? Lost of empathy. "We do not need to care about the minories and the disadvantaged, because ThEy HaVe nO UsE iN oUR WoRld." Well, and extreme capitalism to some extent. Of course, it is not always a case, so some would roll their eyes here.
No outsiders and tribes aside of our own. What does it sound like? Cats and dogs scrambling for territory. "Outsiders would increase competition, which then I would have less to eat." And also anti-immigration. "Build a wall, because they are not Americans, and they take away our jobs!" (Not derogatory on placing pets with humans next to each other. Every opinion is valid if you are willing to change your mind.) We are too emotionally drained from challenging these biological instincts. And we are long since we were educated on empathy and fighting against immoral biological desires.

Sadly, we are placed in an echo chamber at first, then manage to escape the echo chamber. But finally we are trapped in an echo chamber again. There are hopeful exceptions though on the positive note, because there are so many divergent points. I am only outlining one of the possible paths and perhaps also one of the most common paths.

Now you can see that there are always some other approaches to see an issue, but not always the common finanicial and selfishness aspect. That is why I believe conservatives are still humans, perhaps that need some help from us to change their views through a civil manner.

You might have some doubts on the socialism example. The leftist protests give rise to better labour laws. Yes, exactly. You get what I also try to bring out. Changes are not perfect, but why not try them out if we do not actually know the results? Not all governments are willing to push their policies to the most extreme point to meet the radicals. But some governments would try to regain people's support, eventually pushing for a better world.

I might add some more points later. Congratulations on making it through. Treat yourself for your hard work. I sincerely hope that all of us reading this are not falling into defeatism a few decades later. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Great idea!

I have just a few suggestions:

1. Pat Sin Leng separates the north and the south through cliffs that are impossible to walk pass. It serves as an excellent natural land barrier. For Hong Kongers to enter, one has to go along Tolo Channel and Plover Cove. It is also easy to determine a border through other ridges. And moreover, there is a concrete support of democracy in East New Terriories, particularly in Tai Po New Town.

Therefore, it is proposed that Hong Kong will also gain access to Tolo Channel due to convenient access. The boundary, proposed by Hong Kongers, is as follows:

It mainly includes natural barriers. Tai Po Tau Raw Water station is just within boundaries of China. Then the boundary follows the cliffs to Tai Mei Tuk. Plover Cove Reservoir is gained by Hong Kong, with Bride's Pool given to China. This reservoir has restrictions of giving a specified amount of water to China at a low price. Hong Kong gains whole of Tolo Channel, including Port Island. The boundary cuts through the south of Luk Wu Tung. Hong Kong also gains almost the whole of Sai Kung, Lion Rock Country Park and Ma On Shan Country Park. Finally, the boundary trails along the country parks boundary of Kam Shan. New Terriories Circular Road and Tolo Highway is fully given to China but all land to the north of it is given to Hong Kong.

Science Park, although within China boundary, allows unrestricted entry for both Hong Kong and China. Hong Kongers travel to Science Park by water taxi.

2. Hong Kong also complains of the lack of transport facilities. This greatly annoys China and disputes occur again. China then allows Hong Kong to use Tai Po Road, sections of Tsing Sha Highway and a new underground channel to HK Island. With the upon measures, Hong kong is forced to share Kai Tak. Kai Tak has always been quite a concrete conservative population, especially under influences of Starry Lee Wai-king. Kai Tak is then redeveloped into another airport with both China and HK support. The cruise terminal has always been unsuccessful, especially after the pandemic, so there is a swift decision of demolishing the terminal for HK. The important terminal of China becomes Stonecutters Island.

3. Lei Yue Mun Bridge might be easily affected by storm surges. There is the Eastern Harbour Crossing.


Limitations:

North Point and Quarry Bay are very conservative, but it is located in such strategic location, that Hong Kong is unwilling to give up despite potential instability. Unless the boundary is divided along Tin Hau Temple Road and Pak Fuk Road, it is impossible to give these areas to China. However, the small roads have a low capacity to traffic, which is disadvantageous to HK. In addition, thickening the road would involve demolishing civilian buildings, risking instability to the already unstable HK. Traveling through North Point and Quarry Bay becomes risky due to crime and riots, so most prefer to use Island Eastern Corridor. A way to solve the problem might be giving the districts to China, leaving out Island Eastern Corridor for Hong Kong. But then the inconvenient location would make law enforcement for China becomes difficult, unless water taxis are used.

With the liberal population in Mei Foo ane Cheung Sha Wan South and the allowance of the usage of Tsing Sha Highway, people there also seek to join Hong Kong. However, thie area also encounters a similar problem to North Point, as it is in a very strategic location. Protests are common in the area. Tack Ching Gang is established. Contray to North Point, the population in Cheung Sha Wan is relatively peaceful (though not so in Mei Foo). Escape out of border is much more common than riots. A solution would be giving Ching Cheung Road and West Kowloon Highway to China and all of the rest of Sham Shui Po to Hong Kong. However, there are also conservative populations in Sham Shui Po, notably So Uk and areas near Sham Shui Po station.

Mai Po and Tai Po are separated by pro-Chinese camps. Traveling through the area poses imminent risks. Transport can only rely on helicopters, which are inconvenient. This should be one of the most serious problems here.

Chinese University is another problem. It has seen one of the most serious conflicts in Hong Kong, and is located right between Tai Po and Sha Tin. However, it is also close to Science Park, and access from Hong Kong would be more difficult, relying on No.1 Bridge and No.2 Bridge. A solution would be giving the area between Tai Po Road and Tolo Highway to Hong Kong. Tolo Highway given to China is purely due to access to Science Park.

The distribution of Tai Po makes the boundary lose the natural barrier of rivers.

In general, it would be a mess. Hong Kong will be a mess under any options.

<TEXT> I have looked up this as everyone has different explanations, but it turns out that many trustworthy sources also have different explanations.

[An astrophysicist from Forbes said that the green comes from nickel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankoberlein/2017/01/24/there-are-green-meteors-and-green-comets-but-never-a-green-star/#45d600604ac8)

>As a meteor enters Earth’s atmosphere, it is heated to the point where its outer layer is vaporized. The metals in the meteor glow with particular colors. Green comes from nickel. The most common metallic meteors are iron-nickel, so green is a common color. This glow tends to be brightest when meteors hit the atmosphere at high speed. For example, fast-moving Leonid meteors can often have a green glow.

With this source, you are correct on the green in green pea galaxies instead.


Then with [National Geography](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/shooting-star-spec/), the green is due to copper.

>The colors of this shooting star may also indicate the minerals that make up the space rock. Different elements emit different-colored light when they burn. Iron, one of the most common elements found in meteors, glows yellow. Silicates, which contain a form of the element silicon, glow red. A green glow, clearly visible in the trail of this shooting star, indicates the presence of burning copper.


However, the link you provided from NASA shows that it is due to ionization.

Nevertheless, on a quick glance on [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora)  , you are correct that excitation causes the green colour in most aurora borealis.

>The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying color and complexity </TEXT>

<TEXT> There are many other reasons for people to hate gay people. For example, a majority of the Chinese are non-religious, but many are deeply homophobic. This is due to our culture with influence to Confuciusism. We emphasize family as a whole rather than individuals. Gay people could not extend their family bloodline, which is contray to traditional Chinese's belief that the bigger a family, the more superior. Note I did not mention having children, because gay men can adopt a child, but they cannot reproduce without going against their sexuality.

You said that there is very few exceptions, but it is not as Chinese weighs a large population in the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> \>Keep you from the Sun (Four Walls)

&#x200B;

Featuring a photo of the [solar eclipse](https://imgur.com/a/6zkZBUf) that you might not be able to witness.  Taken with help of a light filter.

&#x200B;

Like I have mentioned previously on r/Bastille, I view the Sun aspect as not merely outdoor vs indoor, but also about losing hope, with a similar meaning as in Weight of Living Pt.1 and the Anchor. And since today is a special date and has a solar eclipse, I have a lot of thoughts today.

&#x200B;

We are all in our private traps (No Angels). Do you notice anything that is trapping you and keeping you from the Sun?

&#x200B;

For me, I have a lot in hand. Today is the solar eclipse, fathers' day, 11 months from 2019.7.21 terrorist attack in HK, and 1 month from Hungary eroding trans rights. They are all related to my traps.

&#x200B;

Let me talk about Hong Kong first. 11 months ago, mobs in white shirt with suspected pro-government legislator support randomly beat up people in Yuen Long station. Police ignored the mobs and closed police stations, claiming a lack of manpower(I doubt this claim is valid, as the police managed to put foward a lot of manpower on large-scale protests all over HK) . This changed a lot of people's views. Oppression is not limited to political figures,  those with very tight budgets, or minorities and opposing voices. Everyone can be a victim.

&#x200B;

With quite some pressure, some of the mobs were arrested and charged. Unfortunately, the incident is merely an example of violence in Hong Kong, and police brutality is still being viewed as rampant. I had been proud of Hong Kong, of the world-class law and order. Then this came, and rape accusations against the police are in huge numbers. Is this what our police looks like ? Have this political crisis merely exposed their true self?  And aside from the situation in Hong Kong, everyone around the world is suffering from some sort of police brutality and injustice. There is a long way to go.

&#x200B;

Then it is about GRSM. (Oh what would my mother say if she could hear what we talk about) I am part of this minority, and it sucks. I have always seen myself as being comfortable with my sexuality, but really?

&#x200B;

\>I was born in mine, I don't mind it anymore. I do, but I say I don't

&#x200B;

How relatable. Relatable lyrics is one of the reasons why we worship the divine band. Well, it is difficult to actually be fully comfortable, when major and minor verbal aggressions are everywhere, when so many places in this world have death penalty for GRSM, and when those being ahead in the matter would suddenly steer its direction to the opposite side. I should be glad that I have a functioning family, but this makes coming out becomes somewhat more difficult. I have a lot more to lose. I do not really have a very decent social circle for support. I would prefer to hide my feelings (despite attempts of others) or expose everything to the Internet, so I have no idea what would happen in the future.  At least the glorious Bastille is supportive of LGBTQIA+ rights.

&#x200B;

When all of these suddenly matches with Fathers' Day, I become even more anxious. How would my father feel upon hearing the news? Devastated? Heartbroken? Infuriated? He does not deserve such feelings. Hell, no one does.

&#x200B;

And coincidentally, it is also the solar eclipse. Not only my struggles are trapping me from the Sun, even the Moon is today. (But no, I am still very glad to see the eclipse, especially that I am located at an advantageous location.) As the solar eclipse comes, it slips away through the gaps of time. This trap is gone. It is not permanent. It only seems to be permanent within 3 hours. Perhaps so are our struggles and traps. Things will be better at the end. I might tell myself these things, but does it always work? No, sometimes they are useless, but knowing that at least keeps me alive. Not everything had gone to plan, but we made the best of what we had, you know?

&#x200B;

I did have a bad day today (and I would definitely be embarrassed by sympathy), but at least I feel better now. How is your day? Feel free to release your burdens here if you are feeling comfortable to do so. All struggles, no matter if you feel that it is insignificant to others or not, are valid. It is not enough to be dumbstruck, but feeling safe is also important. </TEXT>

This is my first pre-Bastille song that I like. I heard of Alchemy and Irreverence, but I did not like the sound of them. Then this came along, I bursted out laughing, and decided to explore more of pre-Bastille songs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OMG you have arsenic over there? I am not exactly surprised, but it does make me feel even more jealous of you. I am already overjoyed if I find some common coral fossils, and some thin layer of malachite (copper). Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, is surprisingly close to nature and hills. There are areas with stunning views, such as Sai Kung. I bet the views definitely would not be as impressive as yours, but at least I do not have to get motion sickness from long rides. Ironic that I love nature but hate to travel over long distances.

Quartz is quite common, but they can be absolutely captivating when it comes to crystal quartz (but not vein quartz found here in Hong Kong).

I also always ask myself why the artist uses such words, phrases or sentence. Then I might find some double entendres and discover a whole new layer of meaning of a song. I am always amazed by the "knocking heads, laying low" double entendre in one of Bastille's songs. And I have learnt that one of Bastille's songs is related to Ballad of Reading Gaol, so I spent an hour savoring poetry today. Yay we have something more in common.

Yellow-crested cockatoo (critically endangered) looks almost the same as a sulphur-crested cockatoo, which is very common and is a well-known pet species. The easiest way to distinguish between them is their size and location. So, yeah. If you are talking about a pet cockatoo that is not fully grown, it is nearly impossible to tell whether it is yellow or sulphur. I am inclined to think that the ones your brothers' friends have are sulphur-crested cockatoos.

Detective novels should be fun, but when I want to analyze the rhetorical devices used and be a detective at the same time, my head explodes. I can rarely figure out clues in these detective stories, so I am quite impressed by people who can figure out the culprit way before the ending.

I know there are typically two categories of stereotypical gay. One is feminine gays, and the other is gay jocks. I haven't really met a gay jock, but encountering another openly gay man is quite difficult anyway. Homophobia sucks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey there! 16M from Hong Kong. I'm also not into sports. I think it is indeed true that sport fans can be very toxic. To my experiences, many of the male sports enthusiasts are quite loud and rude to me, with many of them homophobic. Like others have said before, the sport shorts are indeed awesome! They are flexible and comfortable to wear (and they turn me on, like hoodies and sweatshirts do).

I think I might not have a typical area of interests among boys/men. I recently discovered my interest in analyzing songs, music and poetry. Literature, philosophy and social issues can be quite intriguing to me. I enjoy listening to music (mostly Bastille) and playing the violin and piano. I love reading books (if I have time, I would like to read something with GRSM representation and/or provokes contemplation) and I vibe with cats as I am introverted. I am quite a huge fan on geology, but I am definitely at the beginning stage of learning it.

I love hiking, rock hounding and watching birds and insects (spiders are the best). Speaking of cock(atiels), there is a critically endangered species of birds called yellow-crested cockatoo here. They are raucous and do not make any tree holes even they only live in them. Easy to see why they are critically endangered, but yet many of them are concentrated on Hong Kong Island. When I say many, I mean many. You can easily identify lots of them when hiking in the north of HK island. (My bird enthusiasm is coming out here Haha)

Living in the North African mountains sounds great to me! I bet there will be a lot of geological features, especially rarer minerals and sedimentary rocks. Well, at least more than that in Hong Kong. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow that's interesting! I have assumed that since ballads are sad songs typically involving death and rape in the 15-17th century, Dan uses the format of ballad for the sad song Four Walls.

And I have just read the poem, and it was incredibly disturbing (like I have anticipated).

Here are other references to the poem:

Sun

>He only looked upon the sun, and drank the morning air

>With open mouth he drank the Sun, as though it had been wine

>And, as we pray, we grew afraid of the justice of the Sun

>For the lampless Earth in which he lies Has neither Sun nor Moon

>With bars they blur the gracious moon, and blind the goodly son




Glory:

After reading the poem, I wonder if Four Walls is connected to Glory as well.

>And wondered why me knelt to pray, who never prayed before.

>We did not dare to breathe a prayer, or give our anguish scope

>  Christ brings his will to light, Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?

>Nor mark it with that blessed Cross That Christ for sinners gave,
Because the man was one of those Whom Christ came down to save.

With Four Walls' perspective, perhaps Glory is the dialogue of two prisoners on death penalty queue. Perhaps they enter prison due to activism against the government (set the world to rights), or simply crimes like murder (DRUNK as we set the world to rights). They tried to make days easier with jokes and each other's comfort. In contrast to Four Walls, they believe their actions are correct and did not feel extremely guilty. But as death penalty approaches, they gain and lose faith in religion, waiting to be buried. The ending is cut short with their deaths, embracing the harsh reality. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sometimes I doubt my analysis is what Bastille intended to do for the song. Why are there so many connections between songs? Are some of them merely coincidences?

>Supposed to save you from yourself

A cell does not contain anything that can let a prisoner committe suicide, to save them from themselves. But why use "supposed". Supposed is usually to deliver a sense of doubt (I suppose you're right vs you're right). Perhaps Dan thinks that it is quite ironic that the best way for a prisoner to save themselves from the guilt is to end their own lives. But this policy produces the opposite effect.

>To keep you from the sun

Sun. Is this another coincidence, or intentional? This sentence refers to a prison trapping its prisoner from seeing the outside world. But I am reminded of the classic light metaphor again, and it makes sense. The cell is to keep a prisoner from the hope of living and getting forgiveness.

>Now we're faced with two wrongs

Dan views that both methods, whether death penalty or not, are wrong. One seems to be too inhumane, and one seems to make victims of serious crimes unable to get justice.

And I would view that this is the connection to Two Evils. Both are wrong and evil. Two Evils speak from the voice of one of the measure. "Let's see whose one gets there faster" is comparing which one is more effective in getting justice for victims.

>And now you, and now you
Now you carry it with you

And now the prison walls is transformed into a psychological weight. The albatross of guilt. This is why I believe the song can be connected to Weight of Living Pt.1 (As with the Sun). And this also why Four Walls can mean a psychological feeling of being trapped (whicg is how I understood it when I first heard the song).

>All you see's the sky
Clouds passing by, clouds passing by

I am reminded of glory. Like "planes flew by" is a symbol of lost opportunities. Can this refer to lost opportunities, as well as the limited view from the cell?

Other connections:

Blame? "Say goodbye to your mother, your father your son." Like we seem to be blindly praising death penalty. Like we fall into another praise and blame mentality. Blame the victim. Blame the killers (while there are other factors such as Perry's mental illness). Praise the death penalty. Blame the death penalty. Blame has also a sort of death element in it.

And see how Dan specifically mentions Perry Smith. Richard Hicokock is hard to sympathize, as he is part of the reason why Perry, someone with a future in arts, murders people for money. </TEXT>

<TEXT> People here are already mentioning the most important technique, which is to smile. The similing one should be the most useful, as you mentioned having a friend being intimidated by your "look". I am mentioning other details that you might want to take note of. You might know some of them, but some of them should be new.

1. Keep a respectful physical distance. People might feel nervous if you stepped into their private space, especially if you live in less densely populated areas. Try to keep a distance of at least 30cm if possible. And of course, you might want to follow the quarantine advice at this moment and keep 6 feet apart.

2. Tonal and vocal notes. The impression of your "look" can be affected by other factors, such as your tones. Try to adapt to the volume of the person you are talking to, and avoid speaking too loud and shouting. You can keep a friendly tone, and this might be done by mimicing your best friend's  tones. I am now having a loud classmate in class. I originally felt intimated by him, but as we got to know each other more and that he adjusted his speaking volume, I am now feeling much more comfortable with his presence. Turns out he is very kind-hearted and is much better than some of my schoolmates.

3. Psychology notes. I have read that people who put their backpacks at the front indicates that they are feeling nervous or uncomfortable, as to increase the distance between people. Psychology sometimes is inaccurate, but at least I myself would put the backpack at the front if I am having a panic attack (or something similar). So you might want to watch out for these clues, and take extra care to your  gestures and tones in these cases.

I am glad that you are having a motivation to improve. As we learn, things are not always smooth. There will be off-days where dispite your efforts, people are somehow even more intimidated, or days where you simply could not control yourself. And they are okay. You can do it and improve yourself eventually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just relistened to the song, and I thought "Is the song actually that simple?" Maybe yes, maybe not.

Lying. What song would you immediately think of? Fake It. So you can turn this song with a political spin. Like convincing that the regime is telling the truth all along after a brutal reality has been exposed. For example, after an exposure of 1989 massacre, CCP justifies her 1989 actions as a way to achieve economic stability. That is CCP convincing that she is telling the truth, that there is nothing actually wrong about the massacre, so covering up it is normal.

With the relationship aspect there can be several connections. Poet, Fake It (on every page a mystery), Another Place (I could write a book about the things you said to me on the pillow and the way of how you make me feel). Send Them Off! (A jealous mind, never satisfied).

The instrumentals also remind me of No One's Here to Sleep, and there are also connections with the song.

>I've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door

>What goes on behind these doors, I'll keep mine and you'll keep yours. We all have our secrets.

With this perspective, again you can interpret it as a murder story. Like the narrator is the murderer. The narrator has killed a friend/suspected lover of his SO due to jealousy. And now the narrator is trying to justify their actions through appeasement and manipulation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unqualified amateur here answering purely with memory of seeing tips related to this. Not a trustworthy source.

So there are two types of rocks in the video, an agate and a geode. A geode is basically a hollowed rock grown with crystals in it. An agate is basically rocks with concentric lines. I know more of geodes.

If you want to find a geode, you would want to look for a rock that is unusually light. You would like to look for a rock that has (volcanic) pockets and pores. Limestone, for example, has abundant pores to allow crystal growth.

Then how to identify volcanic rocks and limestones? Very broadly speaking, volcanic rocks do not have large connected crystals, which is unlike granite. Limestone is a sedimentary rock, may have layers (like rock layers, but not mineral layers), and is prone to chemical weathering. If you pour some acid on limestone, concentrated vinegar and HCl as the optimum ones, it fizzes with some gas bubbles (those are carbon dioxide). But you definitely wouldn't like to have an acid test, since it could likely "dissolve" the crystals.

For agates with visible lines on the outside, eyesight is the key.

Note that they do not always look as rough as a potato. They can be smoothened by waves and by rivers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am sorry that you feel suicidal. I have been there before, and things WILL improve and ARE improving. I advise you to seek help when you are feeling low. It is not always easy (it is extremely difficult instead), but sharing your thoughts to someone you trust can be helpful. If you cannot find a friend to talk about it, then you can talk to a social worker or a therapist.

If you feel deeply anxious just on meeting new groups, then perhaps you can first meet the group members one by one individually, then join the group after feeling comfortable on all of them. I struggled for many years to find out that I am an extreme case of an introvert who hates large groups. It is perfectly normal to feel nervous on meeting new people, particularly large groups.

However, if you are struggling to talk to anyone, no matter your closest friends or someone new, it can be a symptom of depression, anxiety or social anxiety. If you are suffering from any of the above, you may feel that people are judging you all the time. They typically have some kind of trigger event, and it is okay to be diagnosed as having depression. Seek help.Things will get better. You might need to find a suitable therapist for a few times, but you will eventually get one that is suitable for you. Even if you are not sure whether you have these illnesses, seeing a therapist is always beneficial. Everyone carries some burden, and it is fine to seek help. No one's case is too mild to seek help. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So the music video can actually be controversial because of polive brutality around the world.

>You can put some joy up on my face
Oh, sunshine in an empty place

Does this remind you of anything? Sunshine... light? The Anchor? Albatross? Yep, another connection here. This really reflects how being lonely (not exactly alone) is like. But the narrator actually succeeded in finding company. Which is how JOY came up, like in joy up on my face.

I believe empty means an empty heart. It means the hole in the narrator's soul.

>Oh, I can ease you of your pain
Feel you give me love again
Round and round we go
Each time I hear you say

This is another connection. The Silence (Tell me a piece of your history that you've never said out loud). The Anchor. Round and round emphasizes the rhythm and repetition of the lifestyle. Perhaps it refers to the Draw, sometimes being pulled to the darker side, then to the familia, then to the negative thoughts again.

The song has repeated the chorus for a hell lot of times, and it is intentional. Repetition of lifestyle represented by repeated chorus. This is the rhythm of the night.

<TEXT> It doesn't feel right to say out loud in real life. It doesn't feel correct to not share about this. I think this post might not make sense to you. Even the future me might not understand what I am writing.

The Anchor: "You can't explain what is going on with your brain."  "Yeah, but why don't you just try."

Now I am officially starting. (This might be confusing and creepy)

After my nap, I felt both physically and mentally drained. My lethargy started. Then during dinner, I suddenly babbled a lot of philosophy, psychology and life value views. After quarantine and after reading a philosophy book, I am already talking about philosophy all the time. But this time, it doesn't feel right. If I talk that much about philosophy, then I should at least be mildly interested in it at that time, right? But no, I only feel numb. It feels like the words are spoken and not spoken by myself at the same time.

Then my mind decided to go insane. I am thinking "I want to get out. I want to get out." But there is no threat. I have no anxiety symptoms. I am at the comfort of my home. The only things that are uncomfortable for me are the political and environmental reality, and my mind. It feels like my mind wants to escape from my mind. Words are all we have, and I am not aceing the art of language right now. It feels like my mind feels uncomfortable with my body, with my mindset. Like my mind does not belong to this world. As if it is like Send Them Off's "Your mind exists somewhere altogether different. It lives in a world where feelings simply cannot be defined by words."

The lethargy, I believe, belongs to my peculiar aversion on mortal reality. It feels that activities around me, things around me, are merely a distraction from what matters. I am confused on what the thing that matters is. Looking up for heaven, setting the world to rights? Finding the meaning of life? But anyway, I feel that if I go to do anything, I am merely distracting myself from my mind, like saving myself from my brain, but in a negative light.

Then my mind suddenly jumps to Icarus and Snakes. My mind suddenly flashes "Drink to escape their bites" and "Icarus is flying too close to the Sun." I have no idea what my tricks my mind is playing. I would interpret the Icarus one as that my mind is trying to tell me something important, but only to plummet to the ground, back to reality. My mind would repeat these thoughts again, but since it flies too close to the sun, it would fall again back towards reality. But the snakes one? I have no idea. I do not drink alcohol, I am underaged.

I believe Chopin and the piano might help me explain my feelings, my otherworld feelings. I started mixing many different songs, but mostly I was playing a lot of dissoamt chords. I would play major key on my right hand, and minor on my left. Perhaps it refers to my confusion of reality. Like I am only doing things that I am interested in (major) to escape from the dark reality of the truth of my mind (minor). I feel a bit relieved after playing, but the feeling is still there.


I feel lethargy to be the most relatable right now, and I am interpreting the song based on my current thoughts.

>Get up, get up. Pressure, pressure. Run away as fast as you can go. Every day your friends and lovers give the answer everybody knows.

The everybody knows refers to answers with the perspective of a mortal. It does not fully explain what is going on with my brain. I feel that my mind is pressured into staying in this reality. I know it is bizarre.

>You told me not to be like anybody else. Headspin, happiness, death. Be like anybody else, broke down nothing else left.

Am I just trying to be unique and fake through all of the states? What is the meaning of life, if we are merely living in confusion all the time? What is the meaning of life, if we live only to be broken down by microorganisms at the end? Everybody else would tell me that life is what we make it. We decide our purpose. So it means that our well-being is the most important. But it does not feel like it for me. It does not feel like this is the answer for me.

>You checked out years ago. What I'd do not to worry like you.

I am in constant worry that I would check out. My body would resist my mind, or it is the opposite. But then I somehow want to check out from this reality, from the mortal world.

>There's an English man up in space these days, floating in awe and wonder. As he broke away from the atmosphere, and all of us non-believers

I think this is important, but I do not have the words here.

>Paint the scene for me, paint it bright and paint it clear. I don't want to use my imagination here, don't want to use my imagination here

I feel that part of me wants to give in to the mortal world. My mind is simply too complicated to be understood for me.


Mood: confusion, headspin, lethargy

Connections of Forever Ever to other songs:

Bad Blood series (mental health, relationship and friendship)

Shame

Torn Apart (Ready or Not, related to Flaws)

Rex L.: Here is the lyrics analysis:

>I don't wanna talk about it

I believe this is spoken by the "friend" of the narrator. He does not want to talk about it because he has talked for way too many times and could not change is mind. Or that this is the underlying emotions of both people, that they refuse to expose their scars to each other, or in other words, they have lost trust and could not make an assertive communication. It is also entirely possible that both of them are treating this topic as a taboo, making this a connection to "It's been cold for years, won't you let it lie"

>I see ahead of me/ a light that takes my breath

As mentioned, light is a reference to Albatross song and the Anchor, by referring it to hope. Take my breath means to give a strong emotion that is so influential that it is guiding a person's life, like breathing does. In addition, light is given out by fire (passion), so it might mean that this intimacy that the narrator desires is driving her crazy.

You look the same, but I don't recognize you. I'm looking you dead in the face and I can't find you.

This is the connection of this song to Shame in WW. "I can see a change in you-I barely recognize your face"

There is something weird about this sentence. It is a peculiar combination of "look at you dead in the eye" and "look death in the face". I think it is a triple entendre. It means to examine the person's face closely, and realizing that he is not the person he was. It also means that perhaps encountering the abuser was a wrong choice, since the narrator almost lost her life on this. And finally, it may mean that the narrator or the abuser was so depressed that they felt "dead in the face".

>Don't like the way we always talk in past tense. You can't explain the present until you work out what the past meant.

From my previous comment on BB discussion, I mentioned that it might be about suicide. This is another reason why meeting the abuser is a close encounter to death-it affects one's mental health. I believe the second sentence is spoken by the abuser. He is struggling with the friendship's flaws in the past. It might also mean since the past's purpose is to let us accept our past and inspire us for improvement, they are stuck in the past and are using past tense because they still do not understand these ideas.

>Back then and even now I feel there's something that I owe him.

Guilt, feeling that the narrator should be responsible for his well-being, but fail to lead him to the right track. This is a connection to Weight of Living Pt.1 (All the things you've said and the things you've done)

>We were kid mates, making mistakes, playing give-take.

The mistakes part always make me think that the narrator is justifying the abuser's actions by claiming that they are only mistakes, they are not permanent.

>Big hearts rattling their big snakes, rattling their tail

Beautiful metaphor. Using forgiveness aginst authorities?
And another metaphor below. Water again? Water can sail a ship but can also topple one?

>Got into the wrong sport, big swigs, long snorts

The story grows darker and darker. Wrong sport might just mean a bad activity, but I feel like it is running away from the police and from the narrator's  help. Alcoholism here, like the brown. Alcohol is a common theme in Daniel in the Den, Icarue, Get Home...

>Saw attempts to help as spiteful

He fell into the Draw and gave in to the negative side.

>To say the least, he played the beast

Least, beast. Words could not describe how atrocious his actions are, that even the metaphor beast is not enough and is only the least. Makes me think of Four Walls. Like both are suffering from mental illness, both fall into crime and played the beast.

<TEXT> I really should cut my analysis into digestible parts here. And I should go to bed very soon, so I am first posting the shortest analysis, I believe.

Music and rap aspect analysis

This one is quite interesting and is not exactly my most common type of analysis, so let's start

I feel that Kate Tempest is really suitable for the song. She established an extremely melancholic atmosphere that is suffocating and silencing. It is what grief and guilt and grim is like. I feel the emotions, like they are being suppressed but are barely contained. It is exactly what the actress in Bad Blood MV feels like.

After the song enter "you look the same but I don't recognize you", the vocal breaks into two. It is as if the voice broke due to sadness.

"These are the days that bind us" is portrayed in an old-fashioned music style. Like the narrator is indulging into the past and reminiscing when the times are at least better than now.

With Dan singing the chorus, the melancholy climbs, and it transforms into an overwhelming sadness and regret. Notice the changes in the notes. They are flattened, like a depressed person has their emotions flattened, but they still feel melancholic somehow. This gives a hint of the mental issue that the narrator is facing. (Using my previous analysis on the use of water as a metaphor for internal struggles)I also feel anger and resentment, likely from the "friend" of the narrator.

Then it is the reading techniques. I have learnt some basic ones in a prose reading event, and I think this would interests non-native English speakers.

Emphasis is put in key words. I LOVE him very Much and it's very HARD for me to SHOW him. And notice that it also flows perfectly along the beat. Wow, I mean. I am new to rap, but I love this feature.

There are somehow some lyrics painting here. The pronunciation of "all" feels like a whole of lot of all. "going overtime", along with the speed, delivers a sense of movement, that time is passing quickly, but the feeling is not gone. Spiral and down deliver a downward sense in tone. Drifted is like drifting the voice away. Clear is very decisively pronunced.

Then it is the beautiful pronunciation of words. Down, brown, around. They sound very smooth. And notice these words. They might be called as rhyming, but it can also be tail rhyme, a variation of alliteration. It is so impressive that it is used in many inflential speeches, such as Martin Luther King or John F Kennedy. You can find a whole lots of perfect rhymes and imperfect rhymes.

And then it is "I KEPT DISAGREEING". The narrator emphasizes this word, that she feels really strongly about this issue. And this is also another turning point.

After that it is "forever FOREVER". It really makes the song become very powerful and delivers a desperate feeling of the narrator.

Ready or not suddenly sounds very purposeful. The narrator is going towards the point of no return by following her "friend" and indulge in her negative emotions, or even suicide. Or on a positive note, the narrator might just decide to come to repair the friendship again, continuing this story. Torn Apart.

The overlapping of ready or not and those are the days represents the two characters' thoughts at that moment at the same time. Anger, resentment, purposeful, hopeful, hopeless, sadness, grief... I am not a big fan of fading out endings, but this song should be ended like this.

<TEXT> You really have a good point. I personally am very cautious on making these questions. I would insanely search through all the commonly asked questions, then scroll attentively through at least two days of questions. Then I would check carefully for any grammatical mistakes and spelling mistakes in my questions. I do realize acknowledging that people have answered that question beforehand would be beneficial. Respect is definitely important, but I may find myself unhealthily scared of teachers, not daring to ask or answer any questions. I may find myself cringing and having anxiety over not saying a "thank you" or at least say hi. And I do realize that all of these are problematic, and as I am improving, I hope that people would not experience the same.

Balance is important then, I would say. I think it is too strict to make people check through all of the things I have done. The Internet can be an important part for people with anxiety, and I think not making too much demands would construct a healthier environment. At least you can just ignore those who subtly disrespect you by asking another common questions. But you never those if those who are posting are struggling in their lives, and seek this community for support. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember the first time my family ate common figs, we planned to eat the fruits after lunch. I was not having a good appetite and ate my lunch very slowly. Bored, I examined the sliced figs and saw something white wriggling its way inside. I looked at it curiously and wondered out loud, " is that... a worm?" Then with lightning speed, the worm was immediately covered with half-chewed figs.

I only realized later that it was not merely a worm, it was a maggot. Needless to say, we never tried out common figs later on. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Oops I was so taken away by the metaphor that I forgot to analyze the actual song.

Some background information: Forever Ever is musically connected to BB song by a similar chorus and the chant "I don't wanna talk about it"

So the story from Forever Ever supplements the story in BB, about a relationship going sour and disappearing. Basically "bad blood" as a rhetorical phrase is about feeling of anger and hostility/conflict between people. Just like "As the friendship goes, resentment grows".

It seems strange that in Forever Ever, the narrator did not actuall hate the abuser. In fact, the narrator seems to be actively trying to save the friendship. So why resentment grows? I believe this song is written from the abuser. He despises the help offered by the narrator of Forever Ever, and this hatred blinds him, so that he thinks both of them are hating each other as to justify his hatred and distance from her further more.

>We were young and drinking in the park-there was nowhere else to go. And you said you always had my back. Oh, but how were we to know?

Rhyming here. They are drinking to escape their minds and reality. Then the narrator grows suspicious of the person with the influence of alcohol, and the friendship slowly deteriorates. This corresponds to "Of the place that we grew up in, all them times when we got baked in the park."

>That these are the days that bind you-Together, forever.And these little things define you. Forever, forever

So we get where the title forever ever comes from.The narrator becomes obsessive with every mistake and flaws of the girl, which is why it is related to flaws. And there is a subtle rhyme.

>All this bad blood here, won't you let it dry? It's been cold for years. Won't you let it lie?

Rhyming again. This is where the album name comes from. But why cold? Does it refer to in cold blood? Perhaps, if we are interpreting that the narrator is not only an alcoholic and a patient of mental illness, but he is also a total psychopath. But really, I believe it refers to the polar opposite of the heat from passion and fire. So let the relationship rot, like the food in the video. And lie. I know it refers to the stationery state of blood, but I can't help but think of the action of deceiving. If so, this reflecys that the narrator thought they are only lies, the words of comfort. Don't listen to your friends, they only care once in a while.

>If we're only ever looking back, we will drive ourselves insane. As the friendship goes, resentment grows. We will walk our different ways

So this reflects the mental state of These Streets and Flaws. The second sentence basically sums up the whole song, with the third sentence continuing the story.

>And I don't wanna hear about the bad blood anymore. I don't wanna hear "you" talk about it anymore

So the narrator indulges himself into escapism, such as alcoholism further more, leading to Icarus and Daniel in the Den. And notice the difference between the two lines. I don't wanna hear YOU talk about it anymore. So the friendship ends in silence. Just as Forever Ever "We never argue, it just becamr clear" </TEXT>

<TEXT> Indulge in your dreams and fall like Icarus now, and pick up the mess later. I am still underaged for alcoholism, but I wonder if I would be able to resist these addictions in life and fall like Icarus. Still alcohol can be beneficial if controlled carefully, I believe.

There are so many unfair comparisons. I am a teen and at the peak of my mind. I am from HK and exposed to so many different cultures, that I am forced to analyze different perspectives and values. Some say that HKers are generally smart, which is not something to be proud of to an extent. I am forced to analyze literature in my Chinese, and politics in my liberal studies. I am forced to develop a sense of philosophy from my father, and learn communication skills and teaching techniques with the help of teachers.

We all appreciate the band in different ways, and they are ALL VALID. I am just trying my best in the area that I have an advantage at. For example, some may appreciate the band by discovering new songs (Ignoring Messages), but I personally might feel overwhelmed.

By the way, I have developed a general approach in analyzing songs, and I will share it soon.

I am becoming more fond of Bastille day by day. How can such perfection exists on this chaotic planet? </TEXT>

<TEXT> To answer the questions, we might have to go back to Forever Ever, the OPH song with a Bad Blood twist. [Trigger Warning: Mention and discussion of suicide, inappropriate coping strategies Seek help. Yes, you deserve it. It is not "too mild for the need of help]

(PS I am shivering you see, we might have a big discovery OMG I couldn't believe Forever Ever is even more brilliant than I previously thought)

>I see ahead of me a light that takes my breath

Light! What do you remember about light? The Anchor, Weight of Living Pt.1? So this light is the hope that the abuser would change for the better, as a background for yhe whole song.

>Don't like the way we always talk in the past tense

This hints that the abuser is likely experiencing some kind of mental issues, that he is actively suicidal. This is a reason why the narrator seems to be not able to separate from the abuser, sympathy.

>I kept disagreeing, soon he was a different being

This shows the original attachment to the abuser

>Friendship became difficult to say the least, he played the beast. So well I wondered how we'd ever make our peace
That's when we drifted – never argued – it just became clear: The parts of him I loved so well had slowly disappeared, but...

This shows the relationship change between the abuser and the narrator

And this one is VERY IMPORTANT
>Ready or not, here I come – you can't hide. I'm gonna find you and take it slowly

If we are assuming that the abuser has committed suicide, the narrator is finding the abuser, which means [very dark] to let everything fall apart and commit suicide as well. This is definitely not a good attitude for facing adversity, but unfortunately, the narrator feels the need to go on this path.


After reading this you might start to make sense of the video. The girl (I assume) in the video is guiltily and grimly grieving (alliteration) for the abuser. Perhaps the girl is feeling guilty because she feels the responsibility to avert the abuser to the right path, and she fails to do so. Perhaps she sees that she is responsible for the abuser's well-being and life. That he posts pictures all around, becomes illusional.

Now this one is also EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. You may notice that Dan often uses water and fire as metaphors. Why? Water is essential to our lives, we are made up of 90% water, if I remember correctly. However, it also represents the metaphorical distance of relationship between people. It represents the "drowning" and indulgence of negative thoughts, which might be related to mental illness. To sum up, since water is the internal soul of our biology, it is the internal struggles faced by us.

Fire is the polar opposite of water. Fire is passion, the close distance between relationships. Fire is very destructive, and refers to the outside world. For example, when I watch the world burn is the things that is going on with the environment and politics.

So with this theory, both the abuser and the victim are facing mental problems due to the relationship and other factors. Hence the living person is slowly giving up, indulging in negative thoughts (bath), eating rotten food (passively suicidal), going out into the sea.

Then you would be gasping and noticing the structure of Bad Blood Album. It is the conversation between the abuser and the victim. The victim is trying to comfort the abuser. Hence Oblivion, the Silence. The abuser is feeling conflicted. Hence The Draw. They both are indulging in drugs, sex and alcoholism. Hence Daniel in the Den, What Would You Do. The victim slowly realizes the importance of mental health and accepting the reality. Hence Laughter Lines, Flaws.

The cultish element of the jacket might be referring to dependence? Not sure about this one.

<TEXT> I am from a  r/geology post that linked to this post.

So the rock used is a slate. It is a foliated (i.e. there are many rock layers) metamorphic rock (i.e. rock that experienced tremendous heat, pressure, etc. and turned into the resultant rock) derived from shale (a sedimentary rock with many visible layers and foliation). The layers are perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression. So the rock might be easily broken along foliation layers.

Perhaps that the rock is wet/not dry enough. Some water might creep into the layers. When the rock is heated, water evaporated creates pressure along foliation. This breaks the rocks into two neat pieces along foliation layers.

Not an expert. I have just summed up different information, and I might be inaccurate. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Cult discussion: 12th June-Division </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-06-12 10:42:39 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It has been a wild year. Today is the first anniversary of the first police-protester conflict in Hong Kong. Today is 1 year and 3 days from the first shockingly large demonstration in Hong Kong. Protests and demonstrations are continued in Hong Kong, and are ignited in many other places around the world,notably US BLM, London, the Netherlands, Belgium,etc. Division of opinion deepens (or rather, resurfaces). And at the same time, it is almost the birthday of Doom Days. So by combining these elements, we are discussing Divide by Bastille from the album DD.

The journey from 6.14 last year to this moment is, in a nutshell, a rollercoaster. The album is released in the mist of HK protests, and it is sandwiched between two of the largest demonstrations here. DD was strangely relatable for me, and is still very relevant these days. Then I experienced a mental health rollercoaster, some more traumatic experiences for Hong Kong. Then there is a short victory for the protesters as pro-democracy delegates won in a landslide victory. After that Covid-19 came, then police brutality was exposed and resurfaced all around the world. Meanwhile, Hong Kong is facing yet another controversial law, which is even more hideous than the Extradition Law, I shall say.



Now here goes the analysis. Megs ( u/Meghar ) brought me a new perspective to Divide, and it becomes quite political.
The surface view is palpably about the romantic aspects of a relationship, continuing the theme of DD. Then not so surprisingly of the magnificent leaders, the underlying view is about politics. Social cleavage, wars, disputes, Brexit, globalization vs nationalism.

Megs interpreted the song mainly in a positive light. I am also inclined to be a pacifist. But I have just thought of the negative version, and it creeps me to the core. You see, when a political leader tries to stop a protest from happening, he/she/they might claim to want to "restore social order", "end social cleavage" and "restore national glory". (Just see Xi or Trump) After all, why would we divide, when we could come together? And coming together might not mean having a civil conversation, it is the suppression of a political voice. (shivers)

>Roll the window down. Let the air blow 'round you. A sadness in the breeze, as the night divides us.

I think the window part would be the most difficult part to interpret in the song. It could be facing the reality and the public. It could be finding comfort, like "oh I need a breath" from the Currents. Sadness could be from the departure of the lover, or the sharp division of society. For Hong Kong, nighttime is when protests and conflicts escalate drastically. Or the night can be metaphorical, that it is the dark times.

>In these darker days, I push the limit to the love you offer. There's a riot in my head demanding we do this forever.

We all express love in different ways, no matter to our beloved close ones, or to society. Some prefer stability, others prefer excitement and conflicts with resolutions. In the political view, perhaps the leader is struggling to convince himself/herself/themself that the protesters are just offering another way of love and loyalty.

>Just bodies that collide, lost and found each other

The relationship view is obvious. But perhaps the narrator is emphasizing their human nature. They remind the people that the government is raised in desperate times, that the government and the citizens lost and found each other. It is eventually harmful to leave all of the construction behind. The narrator is begging the citizens to forgive, tolerate or forget.

>So roll the window down, won't let you go like this.

The narrator is growing desparate. They desperately desire some change to not let the person/citizens go. Prison for the dissidents? (If it is indeed this result, then the narrator fails to understand that protesters are merely expressing love in a different way) Or reformation? Or forgiveness?



And now it is the applications and discussions of division.

1. Conflicts of interests, of values and of expectations within a society

a. Is it possible to solve conflicts without having one side to give up part of their values?

b. Is there a concrete set of "correct" values that everyone should have?

c. Is there somewhere beyond boundary for us to accept values of others? Or in other words, is there a limit to free speech and respect?

d. Is it merely a pipe dream for humans to come together and ease all divisions?


2. Nationalism and globalization

From the example of the recent 2019/20 protests, we could easily see how different countries and regions can influence one another. The yellow vests movement started the wave of protests. Hong Kong protests revolutionized tactics and strategies against police brutality. BLM in the US transformed nations by raising awareness of polive brutality and hate crimes (racism in particular) worldwide. These are all partly due to globalization (and controversially, historical trend).

Let us look at police brutality in Hong Kong and Chile. There are quite a lot of similarities. The press being discouraged from reporting the truth. Reporters and protesters being shot in the eye. Or the surrounding Citic Tower incident, surrounding PolyU incident, and the US Manhattan Bridge incident. These incidents all involve the police forces surrounding and closing into an area full of protesters, rapidly raising panic. Maybe the police tactics around the world have also influenced one another. (And this is a reason why all world citizens should speak out and help when a social problem arises somewhere else.)

With the omnipresent social media, different cultures, ways of living, and tactics and strategies are able to travel across the planet. This connects and divides all of us. On one hand, we can appreciate  other cultures and add to our sense of a global citizen. On the other hand, cultural shock and exclusion occurs. But nevertheless, globalization is benefitting us, like how the magnanimous band is able to promote their CDs across the world. (This really sounded like a liberal studies lesson until this point)

We could actually make us of globalization and solve global problems together. Like global warming/climate change. But then some would think by combating problems together, we are eventually harming our individual nations' benefits. This is why Trump and his supporters decided to leave different worldwide treaties.

a. How can we balance between combating global problems and defending our nation rights?

b. Smaller and politically weaker countries often are neglected from international attention when an event happens. For example, there is a controversial anti-terrorist law in the Philippines, that even as I live close to the country, I still hadn't heard of it until it appeared on the 10th trending list on Tumblr for merely one day. I didn't even know that there are [large protests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_Rodrigo_Duterte) going on from 2016 there until then. How can we raise the awareness of social problems in these smaller countries? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have also been experiencing your situation. I am a rather emotional person. Perhaps so are you, and it is okay to be emotional as long as we can co-exist with our emotions. It is okay to release your emotions for a short while. In fact, it would be even more detrimental to suppress your emotions. Release it, then manage it.

I really appreciate that you came for help in the first place, then identify that they are merely self-loathing thoughts, but not facts about yourself. That is a great step towards improvement!

A common way is to challenge your thoughts. Feel free to describe your self-loathing thoughts. Imagine that they are a voice? What are they saying? Then imagine you are to comfort a person with similar problems with you. So you should challenge your thoughts with a sympathetic tone, offer alternative visions, etc. If you have a feeling in your head, you can validate your feeling and make alternative perceptions of yourself.

Take the following as an example.

>I must stop crying right now at this moment. Crying hinders me from doing anything, and I hate that I am such a worthless and hypersensitive person.

It seems to be nothing worth challenging, but let us look closer. Crying can actually be beneficial as it lowers stress hormones in our brain. So crying within an appropriate amount of time is okay. Merely suppressing your emotions is not healthy, even you are at a time that is inappropriate to cry. (Validate your feelings first, it is okay to.... then breath.) Are you worthless? I bet you unconsciously motivated a lot of people. Even saying your situation makes me feel that I am not alone in facing these challenges. Also, worthless and hypersensitive is just a label of yourself. It is a perception of reality, but not the reality. It is also temporary. You can improve and not feel worthless or hypersensitive.

It is a bumpy journey towards improvement, but you can do it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Related songs: Flaws

(PS During this passage, you would feel angry, sorrowful, jealous, annoyed and even hopeless. These emotions are okay, and I will try to acknowledge them.)

Today is one of the days where I feel old and wise. As if I were the mariner from Rime of the Ancient Mariner, that I have  experienced an internal emotional storm, and have become "an older and wiser man". I feel that I shouldn't be here, analyzing philosophy of life. As a teen, I should be partying, illegally drinking, being cynical of the world. I should be struggling at academics, exploring the wonders of the world. But yet I am here, being able to share philosophy with you. I do not know I should be thankful or sorrowful for this. I should be sorrowful because I had to be experiencing a lot within my capacity, to be able to somewhat understand this. At the same moment, I could not imagine how I would endure adversities in life without acceptance.

Now here you go. The first song we should understand here is Flaws, which has a rather obvious message. With the BB MV connecting with its video, it discusses how the narrator buries their own emotions, denying the bad blood. Then they realize that they should "dig them out", to accept the reality and "finish what we started".

Firstly, why should we accept ourselves? Everyone knows that we should, but why? It is because we can do nothing to change the reality without accepting it. I know you will shout out questions at this point, but please bear with me. We have different reflexive self-protection measures, including denial, suppression, diversion and false reasoning. When we fail to accept the reality, we would fall into one of these measures, disabling us to cope with the situation.

What are ways to accept ourselves? I bet you will be rolling your eyes on this one, and you have the right to do so. One of the ways is to look at the positive side. What is problematic with this statement is that it is too vague. It seems to be invalidating rather than providing solutions. (So in no way should you shout this out to depressive patients, okay?) We can accept ourselves in this way through gratitude journal, through exploring our talents, through developing an interest Hey, this is what my social workers tell me to do. Yep, it is a way of the "looking on the positives", but just much less invalidating.

(Pause for digestion)

I feel the need to include a paragraph for mental illness here, because I know how it all sucks. Depression is the inability to look at the positives, isn't it? That is why depression sucks and has to be solved through life-long therapy and medication. There is always hope though. The first thing that you may do is to accept that you are diagnosed with depression. Note that I did not say "you ARE depressed", but "you are DIAGNOSED WITH depression". These are different.

Firstly, we should understand the concept of labeling. Labeling refers to something that is NOT a fact, but rather a perception of reality. (Headaches provoked, and you will wonder how on earth is depression a label). For example, "I am a terrible singer", said by Dan. Clearly it is not a reality. We all have a consenus that Dan is an excellent singer. We are literally worshipping his voice. It is just the perception of his reality by himself. There will be better labels (eg Dan is absolutely wise), but labels all underlie a permanency. So in short, depression is not permanent and is just a label. It is simply used to give you better treatment (and it is not wrong to accept help). I label myself as someone with little ability to fully explain my ideas, but I know that due to some peculiar mind trick, abled people will think that they suck, and it is the opposite for the ignorant. This is another hard pill, and it is acceptable to be ignorant as long as you take steps towards changing it.

People that are not at the stage of acceptance does not mean that they suck, that they are too stupid, or that they have a mental illness. Nope, nope. Everyone is at some stage of acceptance, because it is such a bumpy journey. I bet your therapist still struggle with self-acceptance some day, and that is perfectly normal.

I will leave you with some time to digest. These are only the surface level and it is already headache-inducing. You will have a lot of questions in your head (eg self-pity, self-defeatism, which are slippery slopes towards not accepting yourself), but it is unwise to push everything at once to you.

Question (somewhat advanced):

1. What are some songs of Bastille that promotes acceptance, aside from Flaws? (Hint: Bad Blood album will be rather obvious)

2. How did Flaws apply the core belief of acceptance and turn it into action? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Feel free to share the news in Belgium and any thoughts that you have! I always wanted to include a larger area of discussion covering all continents as a part of the discussion. A lesser known oppressive regime is just as bad as a widely known oppressive regime, and both of them is worth mentioning. I always feel sorry that HK can have so much attention at our protests, while other protests or oppressive histories in Middle East, Africa or S. America are being rejected from international attention.

The limitation of a history class is that every event is entangled with another, but there is such a limited time for teaching all of them. As a result, important events in history are neglected because they may SEEM to have an insignificant influence around the world at THAT moment, or because it affects only minorities of society (especially people of colour and GRSM). I think it is our duty as citizens of the world to learn more about the shady histories around the world, especially those affecting minorities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I knew of King Leopold II and his atrocities, but I did not know that there are statues of him everywhere. Why would anyone want to preserve statues of such a gruesome king? I could include these news from Belgium in my future posts.

2019/2020 are such prominent years for protests around the world, with demands surrounding police brutality, democracy and economic reforms. It all started with Yellow Vests movement in France, then African and Latin American countries, then to the familiar Brexit and Hong Kong protests. Towards the end of the year, it was Egypt, Iraqi, Lebanon, Catalonia, Bolivia, Italy and India. Even Malta was included, which is the most surprising for me as I thought that Malta is simply an exotic and peaceful island. There is no true peace around the world, it seems.

In 2020, it is the Black Lives Matter protests, Belgium protests, Philippines protests, and of course other ongoing ones.

The protests are affecting one another closely. They all encouraged democracy advocates around the world, and raised awareness of police brutality and dictatorships. The tactics and strategies are also shared among protesters, notably Hong Kong "be water".

We are living through history. We will be recorded in future historical textbooks for students to study by rote with headaches. We will be written down in history, and we will live forever. I do not know if this is good news or not, but all I know is that I am curious of all the outcomes. I hope Martin Luther King's dream would become the reality, but not merely an utopia or a pipe dream.

Emotional validation is so important, and analyzing songs while discussing social issues has become a novel interest of mine. I love to spend time on these posts.

(PS  I might include some of my texts here for 25/6 discussion. It can be titled as "activism") </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am quite safe but unsure about the future. Yeah, we all hope that nothing will similar to 1989 6.4 would happen to anywhere, anyone or at anytime. I will be fking hating Trump for all I have if Trump decided to enforce some martial law, allowing even more police brutality. I doubt it is possible for me to hate Trump more though.

My song choice that suits BLM is definitely Basement in OPH2. Or Free in OPH2. Or even What Would You Do. They are all talking about the lack of social mobility for blacks, and about the privileges and discrimination that other people have. There are tons of others, but these are the most obvious for me. Also YOUR VOICE IS A WEAPON, SO DO WITH IT WITH WHAT YOU CAN.

Divide is quite an interesting choice. I assume that you perceive the song as easing the polarization and tension in society? That is a great perspective!

My plan:

Concerning 6.12 discussion, the topic might be police brutality and echo chamber. I might talk about the similarities between CITIC Tower Incident and Manhattan Bridge incident. I might be talking about the treatment of medics in both places. I might talk about the effect of laws to society, with HK and Philippines as an example. There will be tons of lyrics reference in echo chamber, of course. I aim to let you know more about different perspectives.

Then it is the 6.21 discussion. The topic might be Pride, riots and pro-government terrorism. This time we are jumping to a special date in both Hungary and Hong Kong. I will be talking about correlations of pride and blm, as well as Bastille's support. I am again touching some controversies, particularly on the perception of riot.

6.25 is definitely for the Americans. I might be running out of materials to talk about, so there can be a switch in discussion leader. We can shit talk about Trump. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Wow I am impressed that you are very hard working. I could imagine how pressed for time you are, and how busy and stressed you might be.

I am no expert and am just sharing some advice from my social worker. It is indeed quite difficult to squeeze out time in your case, but there is still hope. To-do-lists and time tables are the common time management strategies that I doubt I have to explain them in detail. Perhaps the solution is to take some naps to compensate the sleep loss like I have mentioned. Just lying in bed, or closing your eyes without falling asleep can already be beneficial. With the few hours of sleep, sleep quality is crucial, so you might want to drink water instead of energy drinks (as they contain caffeine), or putting down your phone one hour before sleep. If you wish, you could study and make paper notes during this hour. I know occupations usually require you to use devices, so I am not suggesting work here, though it is up to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Two skulls flirting with each other. Laughter Lines is the conversation between two living people, or one alive and one dead. Meanwhile, everyone is dead here. There are no lives lost here between us.

Six feet under. Hey everyone. Maintain social distance. You are either six feet away horizontally from a living person, or six feet under the living people.

Four Walls is mentioned here. It is the coffin that traps us in walls. It symbolizes death. Just as death awaits for Perry Smiths in the four walls of a prison.

>A match is our only light
It's day of the dead and I'm Indiana Jones here
These coins sit upon our eyes
Pool our funds and pay the boat together

Like they are imagining that they are still living and having Indiana Jone adventures together. Stories told to me, and stories told to you. But what matters is not the reality, it is the process. Some cultures might put a coin on a dead eye, I assume? But it is more that. In Genius,

>This line refers to the boat ride across the River Styx, ferried by Charon. He took newly deceased souls across the Styx and Acheron—rivers that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead—for a price.

>To put a coin to pay for the ferry ride across either in or on the deceased’s mouth was a common Greek burial tradition.

I think it could be correct. Or else it refers that our coffin is unreasonably expensive, and we are literally putting money (coffin lid) on our heads. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Mind if you can tell us the reason, so that we can work out a solution? I personally have a lot to do at night, so I would have a short nap at noon. The key is a REGULAR and UNCHANGING sleeping schedule that works for you. Caffeine and devices deteriorate your sleeping quality, so you might want to not have them 1 hour before sleep if plausible.

As I have mentioned in my previous comment, you might be having a form of social anxiety, even that I am not an expert. The name of a mental illness is just a label, and do not define you. Hell, it might even be an incorrect label in this case. Add oil, and things will improve! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am not an expert, but I think you meet many of the key symptoms of social anxiety. Unable to maintain eye contact. Inability to maintain conversations even with family and friends. Having a hugely unpleasant social experience. Not able to laugh (Unable to naturally make facial expressions due to emotions). Worrying about what others think. I would definitely suggest you to see a psychiatrist if plausible. (PS Nothing is too trivial for mental health advocates. You deserve help, and it is not shameful to receive help). Even if it is not social anxiety, half a pill of serotonin might also help, I guess. (But do not attempt to self-medicate).

Firstly, if you are feeling that you are boring, develop an interest. Really, people rarely feel boring if you consider yourself as interesting. There will always be some that would share your passions on your interests. You might not have a pleasant social experience before, but there are always nicer people. The interest can be music, sports, reading, gaming, films, etc. No interests are more inferior than the other.

If you feel that you are always forgetting techniques, write them down on a card, then carry it with you whenever you go. It is normal to forget stuffs once in a while, especially when enduring anxiety.

Perhaps if you are not feeling confident and are having anxiety, challenging your thoughts and breathing exercises might help. Count your abilities (anything you consider as insignificant is significant to others). What is the worst that would happen? Exhaust your anxiety by throwing this question for 10 times. The worst results are always solvable.   Are you predicting the future, having emotional reasoning, or making things look worser than they seem. After challenging your thoughts, write the results down. Say them out loud. (Eg. The worst that could happen is merely the person not liking me. I can solve it with the help of time and words (eg texts). And I can always find another friend, even if it may seem difficult. Not everyone is looking at me, because they are thinking that everyone is looking at themselves as well). Then reward yourself.

For breathing exercises, imagine yourself in a forest with everything perfectly fine. No animals going to jump at you. The shades are just enough and not too much, so is the temperature and humidity. No humans shouting at you (yay). Observe your body. Are you overheating, hyperventilating? There are no wrong reactions, so you need not fear them. Scan your body from head to toe for abnormal pressures, pain, etc. Breath in from the nose for 6 seconds. Feel the cool air entering your body slowly, and it turns into a brilliant spark of blue magic coursing through your capillaries towards the uncomfortable area. Hold your breath for 7 seconds. Breath out to the mouth. Feel warm and humid air contacting your lips and throat. Imagine negative emotions leaving your body through your capillaries.

I also recommend a gratitude journal and write down three things you are grateful for each day. I know it is hard to develop it as a habit. You can do it. Nothing is too insignificant to write down. I feel grateful for staying alive through a bad day. Keep up your 100% survival streak!

Social skills: "I understand that you are feeling [emotion of subject]. In fact I appreciate you that you can [heartfelt appreciation, such as feeling very motivated to do their job]. However I also felt [your own emotion, such as being hurt by your words]. Could you [offer a solution that benefits both of you]"

You have time to improve. You might be feeling intense gratitude after facing your adversities. There will be off days, and they are definitely okay and normal during your journey. In fact, you might feel uncomfortable for improving, because our mind does not want to leave the familiar state.  Techniques are not always successful, and the key is endurance and not losing hope. Yes, it is hard, but you will turn out to be fine.

Tl;dr You could see a psychiatrist for social anxiety. Develop an interest and try to feel that you are not boring. Challenge your thoughts and have breathing exercises. Practice gratitude and assertive communication. You can do it, and you will improve. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Cultist Discussion: 4th June-racism, oppression, and mental health </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-06-04 09:39:24 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi. Rex here. As we as cultists should have known, there is a massive protest regarding black lives matter and police brutality. And coincidentally, today is the 4th June, the 31st anniversary of the tragedy playing out at the Tiananmen Square. It is a massacre carried by the CCP. Meanwhile, CCP described it as a "riot against class revolution". This is an irony of 1989, since many revolutions against Communist regimes were in fact successful. My hearts go to all the victims during the massacre, the victims' parents and all the Chinese activizing against the government on this issue.

  With a heavy heart on both the US and China, on both Hong Kong and Taiwan, I am now posting this discussion.

  Our glorious Bastille has now openly supported the Black Lives Matter movement. This movement has a lot to be related to Hong Kong 2019 Protests, which I would cover it on 12th June, another special date for Hong Kong.(You can also mention some special dates in your country). Some other things that I would cover later include the Manhattan Bridge incident and the HK CITIC Tower incident. I would also mention Hong Kong National Security Law and Philippines Anti-terrorist Law.

There are quite some controversies on the BLM. I stand proudly that I am anti-racist and I condemn police brutality, both in US, in HK or in other countries and regions. But I would not tell you my stance on some other controversial topics as to maintain a certain level of neutrality.

Bastille lyrics and anti-oppression:

There are quite a lot of lyrics that deliver an anti-oppression view in Bastille's songs. They include Fake It (where I discovered the connection between the song and 1984) and The Currents. Firstly, I would like to analyze Fake It (again). The crucial lyrics here are "knocking heads, laying low", which completely switches the meaning of the song when it is interpreted as referring to the government hiding the acts of punishing its own citizens harshly due to "bad behavior". Another one should be "we should rip it straight out". It refers to the crime of history erasure and manipulation.

In The Currents, Bastille condemns how Trump lies without realizing what impacts his words would provoke. But what is worth mentioning is the quote from, ironically, an *American* propaganda.

>When anybody preaches disunity, tries to pit one of us against the other ... you know that person seeks to rob us of our freedom and destroy our very lives

Suits the situation very well, huh? Racists in America are trying to tip one against the other by segregating and discriminating against black people. And ironically again, is that these people are claiming themselves to be demanding freedom from the government (eg coronavirus quarantine).

From these lines, we could easily see that Bastille is anti-racist and anti-oppression, and we can understand why Bastille supports the BLM.

Then there are some discussion topics regarding some of the controversies [Trigger warning]:

1. In Of the Night MV, Bastille depicts a police officer/detective on night shifts enduring the darkest side of humanity, the murders and suicides. At the end, he could not resist his rhythm of the night and commits suicide. This shows that Bastille may have a sympathetic view towards the job of a police officer. Is it self-contradictory and hypocritical that Bastille sympathizes with the police while condemning the police through BLM support?

2. In Sleepsong, Bastille depicts the thoughts of a person having insomnia, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I believe this is especially the case for people hearing gunshots, smelling tear gases and observing people committing arson right across their windows as they try to fall asleep. It is observed that citizens' mental health deteriorates during protests and social movements. How can we balance between our mental health, and being aware and contributing to activism against social problems? (PS Your struggles are VALID and are NOT too trivial to be mentioned. Things ARE getting better. (using the present continuous tense to express a future with certainty.) )

3. With people yelling ACAB from their windows every night, it seems that there is a bad blood between protesters on one side, and police and the government on the other. How can these conflicts be resolved?

4. What are some other lyrics and songs that depicts the teaching of Bastille towards BLM? (I have left some rather obvious ones, including my favourite song from my favorite OPH.)


To do list this week:

1. Take care of your mental health. I know this is a hard time for all of us, but things WILL change for the better. You are definitely allowed to not checking the news frequently. If you experience intense emotions while watching the news, you can rest from the bad_news for a while. I know it is such a sucker punch to see so much chaos around the world.

2. Educate yourself on racial issues of the US and of your country/region. Educate yourself on the social and democratic movements of your country. Educate yourself on 1989.6.4 Tiananmen Square Massacre.

3. Identify privileges that you have, no matter racial, social, economic, political, gender, sexuality/romantic attraction, etc. Think of how to make these factors to become simply a trait but not a privilege.

4. Promise me to remember the brutality of regimes even as years fly by. Promise me to remember George Floyd and other victims from police brutality. Promise me to forever stand with the minorities and with the powerless.

(PS You are allowed to beat me up if I disavow the event of 1989.6.4  31 years ago.)

毋忘六四 平反六四 結束一黨專政

Translation: Never forget 6.4. Vindicate for victims of Tiananmen Square Massacre. Demanding the end of one-party dictatorship.

I wish the same for Americans and other people suffering from oppression. Never forget victims of police brutality and racism. Vindicate for the arrested innocents, black people in particular. End police brutality and systematic racism. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bastille is such an endless rabbit hole. There are always songs yet to be discovered. I still haven't had the time to listen to other "alternative" Bastille songs such as Annie Oakley Hanging, or some of the collaborations in the tournament. And yet every song is so impeccable, especially in terms of lyrics. Endless double entendres and metaphors. Endless phrasal verbs and idioms (which is quite troublesome but fascinating for a foreigner like me). The instrumentals can also connect with the lyrics, like lyrics painting. Not to mention the creation of theme in the instrumentals in The Draw or Laughter Lines.

By the way, the drums used in the song can also be a form of lyrics painting. I can feel the drumming. We all can. (Ominously) </TEXT>

<TEXT> There is absolutely no analysis on Genius on this song? Even that I did not watch the movie, there are still so many things to analyze. What happens if someone who have watched the show to analyze this song.

>Every carpet, every floor
Everywhere I look I fall
Climbing up the walls, I'm climbing up the walls
What goes on behind these doors
I'll keep mine and you keep yours
We all have our secrets, we all have our secrets

There should be something significant about the first two lines, yet I couldn't figure it out. Is it about the frustration of not solving a crime? Is it the resentment of a criminal to be stopped by the police?

Climbing up walls is something considered an action done out of pure desperation. Perhaps it is a criminal getting away with crime, by climbing up the prison gates or by hideous methods of hiding their crimes. Perhaps it is the deterioration of the dignity of the police, that they are using inappropriate ways to combat crime.

We all have our secrets. We all have our darkest corners. The narrator tries to justify their actions with this statement. If we all have our secrets, why not just keep them to ourselves and do nothing? Why expose the truth of one another?

>You were always faster than me
I'll never catch up with you, with you
Oh I can feel them coming for me

The chase between criminal and detectives. Quite obvious, I would think.

>Here's the pride before the fall
Oh your eyes they show it all
I can see it coming, I can see it coming
As I rise up through each floor
Shit gets dark when you lose it all
I can hear it coming, I can hear the drumming

We are always proud of ourselves until an adversity knock the breath out of us, and we are plummeting towards the reality. Like Icarus. We always leave clues in our body language, like the eyes. This is used for detectives to detect lying, for criminals to achieve manipulation.

Shit gets dark when you lose it all, because the narrator assumes that all people would fall from grace and abandon their moral values to make things better for them. This could also be a reflection on the lack of social mobility, differential execution of law, or simply hardships of being penniless.

The drums might be the beating heart, the anticipation of catching a criminal, the nervousness of getting away with murder. THIS IS THE RACING HEART CAN YOU FEEL IT? CAN YOU FEEL IT? It could be footsteps hurrying towards the narrator. I get from the song that the narrator is a bit exhilarated from all the chasing, no matter it is from the perspective of a police or a criminal.

I actually voted out No One's here to Sleep in the last election, and I kinda regret it now.

I feel that this song is related to Laura Palmer, especially the murder of her. That is why there is a subtle connection between racing heart and drumming. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I will post it tmr in terms of HKG Time. You might be able to guess why. Let me give you a hint: It is about the anniversary of a prominent protest in China. Then I might post on 12/6, and I will also leave you the reason why I choose this date. Perhaps discussions can also be made on 25/6, 21/7, 31/8. I also hope to include other important dates for France, India, Philippines, Chile and Boliva. An international perspective is important. I am not familiar with Chile or Boliva though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I first saw this post (there is no detailed report on US protests here in HK, we have another mess of a law for us.),  I thought this was mimicking the tactics of Hong Kong Police. On 12/6/2019, the police [surrounded](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_June_2019_Hong_Kong_protest) a building full of protesters and threw tear gases to the crowd right outside of the building. The siege of CITIC Tower.

The USPD might be mimicking HK Police's tactics (one of the worst examples of police tactics in first world regions), but protesters are also using HK Protesters' tactics, such as extinguishing a tear gas with the help of a cone. It is wild that the city I live in can have so much influence on the world. I partially believe that the protests in Chile, India, Boliva and other places are also inspired by Hong Kong Protests' "be water" strategy.

Unfortunately for the police, the siege incident almost single-handedly provoked the massive protests here in June and early July, especially the 616 protest. Another turning points are 721, 831 and 10.1 . The police definitely lacked a long-term insight in my perspective. The "stopping violence and maintaining order" strategy of the government failed catastrophically, and I do not see how it would be different in the US. When you try to extinguish a flame of anger and protest, you do not extinguish it with force. Instead, it is with empathy, with understanding and with solutions to the underlying problems and the fuse of the protests. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a rather unconventional view to the song that makes it more political and depressing. It might not necessarily be the original intent of the song, but after all, art is defined by the audience, isn't it?

  My new interpretation all started in the music video. There is a WWCOMMS sign. It's burning. There are, again, three possible interpretations. One is that Dan is trying to incorporate the WW theme into the video. Another is that Dan is using the chaos of the world as a background, enhancing the escapism theme. The third one is mine, that it shows the political atmosphere of the song to let the audience understand the underlying meaning of the song.

  And then it is the lyrics that inspired me.

>And drunk we set the world to rights as we fell and hit our heads upon the curb

Ouch. The first lyric might be about the perfectionalism of the narrator. Another interpretation is that the narrator, along with their friends, are trying to make into activism and actually improving the world in the mist of chaos and drunkenness. Then ouch,  they failed miserably. Are they arrested and pushed onto the ground? Is this just a metaphorical phrase? We have no idea.

 I am finally starting to analyze the song at this point of writing, so you know how long to expect.

>Counting the planes as they flew by, inconceivably imagining them go

  It is the lost opportunities in life that the narrator missed while attempting perfectionalism, being an activist, or simply thinking about life, death and religion. See "looking UP for heaven".

>You make me laugh until I die
Can you think of any better way to choke?

After the incident, the narrator indulged into escapism through his familia

>Stories told to me and stories told to you. Did you ever feel like they were ringing true?

It could be about social media. It could be about political news. There are so many fake news here, that we might be misunderstanding the situation, that the world is not as good or bad as it seems to be from the TV's window. Or it could be about religion, the skepticism of Bible stories.

  Time for the chorus.

>And all their words for glory, well they always sounded empty when we're looking up for heaven.

Glory. Glory to the lord. Glory in the Bible. Glory to Hong Kong. Glory to Britain. There are multiple interpretations again. This could be about religion or politics. All they have in common is that the narrator thinks they are just empty words with empty promises. They are not real, or they are not plausible. Heaven might not be real, all we see is the sky  there's no looking up for heaven. Heaven is also a symbol for the attempts in changing the world for the better. Things will not become utopian-like in narrator's mind despite all attempts. Therefore, we are just on Earth on the dirt. Be pragmatic. There is no religious heaven nor perfect system in our society.

>Not everything had gone to plan, but we made the best of what we had, you know?

It is about life with the partner, or about politics. We have done our best, and this is what matters. The chaos, the consequences, they do not matter at the end.

>Passing the drink from hand to hand, we admit we know nothing at all

With the defeatism, the narrator indulged into alcoholism. We do not know about the future. We know nothing of the future of BLM movement, nor the US, nor Philippines, nor Britain, nor HK, nor India. There is simply so much to explore. What happens after death? What would WWCOMMS end up to be? What would their relationships turn out to be? We know nothing, but all we know is that things will not always turn out as we wish to be. There is no perfection, no looking up for heaven. All we know is that we should try our best, and the results do not matter, only the process matters.

>And then you put your hands in mine and pull me back from things divine. Stop looking up for heaven, waiting to be buried.

The narrator's partner helps the narrator to get over with perfectionalism and stress from attempting to improve society. They become pragmatic, and will be buried on the ground.

Very beautiful. [Sighs dreamily] </TEXT>

<TEXT> I cannot believe that I actually wandered into a porn subreddit and discussed politics instead.

Firstly, yes, political stance is a spectrum. I think it is unfair to just use "Democrat" or "Republican" on politics. So is other tiers such as the "auth/lib left/right" model.

Secondly, I am sorry with your experiences with democats and that you feel democrats are alienating you. I could assure you that most democrats are not as sexually open as the ones you mentioned. Well, from what I see, you are also judging the whole bunch of democrats with the loud ones wearing sexual organ costumes around kids.

Thirdly, could you explain some other reasons that made you a republican, aside from the sexual openness and negative experiences with democrats? I feel that we are having a misunderstanding becuase of the identity of you being a republican. A republican is not a good representation of what political ideas one have, and I think this is causing the misunderstanding here.

And lastly, you are welcome to support Republican if you like. It is free speech and democracy (basing on the condition that you respect others, which I appreciate that you can maintain such a long, civil and respectful conversation here). At least this is from my view as a rather moderate democratic socialist (which is not exactly socialism or communism). There will be republicans that might have a similar viewpoint as you do. In fact, the most controversial post that I have last checked on r/lgbt is about voting democrat because of its lgbt stance. But no, there are indeed republicans that are GRSM-supportive. And there are homophobic arseholes in democrats. It depends on where you live, really.

By the way, I doubt that the person you are commenting on is trying to upset you. You can try to be comfortable and challenge his/her/their view or even your own view. I always appreciate CMV conversations.(And to some other people reading this, mind if you stop downvoting others based on their opinions and experiences? Educate, not invalidate.)

Great. Embracing the downvotes rolling in. Submit. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just saw a [tweet on Bastille commenting on Joy](https://twitter.com/bastilledan/status/904486082150113280?s=20), and they said it was "ironic"?

Irony is the happening in a way contrary to what is expected, and typically causing wry amusement because of this. There are three possible ways to interpret this, and one would devastate you.

The first interpretation is that Bastille is joking. Like playing into the image that Bastille never makes positive songs.

The second interpretation is that the mood all along Doom Days is very terrible, that it is an unexpected way to end the album. Who would feel joy on a doom day?

The third one is, hmmm, very dark. It is the suicidal thoughts of a person. "I was giving up oh I was giving in". See the past tense? Is the narrator giving up their live, with the push of a negative comment. That they feel joy in a twisted way, like Juliet does before she kills herself?

Please do not tell me it is the third one. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really hope everyone can be empathetic to each other. I am a Hong Konger. It is true that we are not as oppressed as the US people of colour. I am knowledgeable that there are systematic problems concerning the social mobility of black people and the corruption/racism/homophobia in the police community of the US. Hong Kong's situation is more controversial and complex with no side being an overwhelming majority (Only 60% of HKers support the protests). Not all people are obligated to aspire to democracy, but all people are obligated to respect one another in spite of race.

However, from my point of view, Hong Kong protesters are also somewhat being oppressed, and young people are being discriminated by the police. Take this as an example. (I am using Wiki because it is rather neutral and does not require translation, which would take time and may include my bias): [San Uk Ling Holding Centre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Uk_Ling_Holding_Centre)

>In September 2019, 31 people detained in San Uk Ling were sent to North District Hospital, among whom six were seriously injured with bone fractures.One person was reportedly beaten to the point that his arm was connected to his torso only through skin.Others reportedly had their teeth beaten out,and some reportedly suffered intracerebral haemorrhages.There were also allegations of delays in sending the injured to the hospital, and deprivation of necessary medication.Some protesters taken to San Uk Ling also alleged sexual assault by officers there. Six justices of the peace who had wanted to visit San Uk Ling to investigate allegations of mistreatment there saw their request denied.

San Uk Ling is located in the North District of HK, which is distant from the city centre and has more of a proximity to the Mainland. This is why some would suspect that there are Mainland officials blending in with the police in San Uk Ling.

I believe that we can at least remain civil in our conversation and not attempt to invalidate other's feelings. Sure, we are not experiencing police brutality for over half a century. But does that mean that we do not deserve to feel oppressed? When the police voiced out derogatory slurs such as 'cockroaches' to refer to protesters? When pro-government senator Junius Ho, having a background with the involvement of gangs, are seen supporting mobs in white shirt on 721? When police indiscriminately beat up citizens in Prince Edward station on 831? When not only protesters, but also by-standers,  social workers, voluntary medical staff and journalists are experiencing police brutality as well?

(I am not mentioning the peculiar suicide cases such as a swimmer and protesters first being claimed to be drowned to death, or the 'hidden deaths of 831', because they are not yet confirmed)

I know it is difficult to stay calm and remain civil when there is so much injustice going on. But as least I wish we could be respectful of other's opinions. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am literally analyzing this song in my head earlier, and here we are discussing the same song today.

I love how some Bastille song titles is not included in the lyrics. So this song, quite obviously, is about the narrator's thoughts while in bed. Depression can cause constant tiredness and insomnia, so the narrator is still not asleep and  is struggling with their thoughts.


>Oh, in the strangest dreams, walking by your side
It is the hole you impose upon your life
When you're out, loneliness, it crawls up in the ground
It's what you feel, but can't articulate out loud.

Mental illnesses would cause a deterioration in sleep quality, resulting in strange dreams and nightmares. Victims of mental illness might have self-blame thoughts, perhaps thinking that their mental illnesses are not worth the attention or are imposed by their own (ie suffering the consequences of their own actions). It sucks that depression, anxiety, etc. may cause an inability to connect with others (that one has to fake all emotions and present a normal facade, that decreases one's social skills), causing loneliness that is difficult to be got rid of.

These are the summary of some thoughts a patient of mental illness would have, but it is difficult to explain to outsiders. Everything is in abrupt chaos. The Anchor may have referenced this line. "You can't explain what's going on with your brain"


>And it scares you being alone
It's a last resort

These lines might be the most confusing lyrics in the song. Mental illnesses, notably anxiety, would cause an inability in maintaining relationships. But having to deal with the invisible monster on your own is much worse.

Nevertheless, what does 'it' refer to in last resort? Firstly, we should know what last resort is. I think many native speakers might be familiar with this idiom, but anyway, it refers to the only choice that remains after every other option is unavailable. I have no idea what the lyric means until I got into a particularly bad period of time. [Caution: Potential trigger ahead]



I was not brave enough to meet other people and socialize. What if I break down in front of a crowd? Is everyone judging me on the way, thinking I am weak, that I am a coward? That big boys don't cry, and I should bury my emotions? At the same time, I was afraid of being alone. If I am alone, no one will stop me from doing anything. If I attempted suicide or self harm, no one would stop me. Being alone should be the last resort, since suicide is passing a point of no return.

I am glad that I am in a better place now. Mental illnesses are the worst, since the awareness of it is still quite low. "JuSt GeT oVeR iT" "ItS AlL iN yOuR bRaIn" "YoU hAvE nO rEaSoN tO bE dEpReSsEd". Ugh.

But things WILL get better for ALL of us. You are NOT ALONE. We WILL get through this TOGETHER. There ARE better days ahead. YOU are important and are NOT a burden to others. Take care of yourself. Stay hydrated, do some breathing exercises, do some exercises if plausible, listen to some Bastille music. Challenge your negative thoughts. Record three things you feel grateful for each day, no matter how insignificant it might seem (Staying alive is an achievement). Your streak of surviving adversity is 100%. Keep your awesome record!


>Your dreams and memories are blurring into one
The scenes which hold the waking world slowly come undone

Victims of mental illnesses might suffer from a bad memory. The world becomes a catastrophe, and everything breaks down.

>You'll come undone

This one really gives me goosebumps. YOU'LL come undone. As if the negative thoughts are predicting you to break down and fail. Which is not true. You will get through your challenges.


As mentioned before, this song is closely related to other ATBB songs, especially The Silence, The Draw, Weight of Living Pt.1, etc.  The escalation of percussion and the sorrowful slow ending really suits the theme of the song. The instrumentals represent the mood changes in the narrator, from slowly becoming more depressed and anxious, to the peak of anxiety, then to a sorrowful and hopeless ending. (Shivers)

I hate that I could relate to the song. This song carries me through a lot of hard times. Emotional validation from music is very important for me, that I would listen from Weight of Living Pt.1 to Laughter Lines every time I cry. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So this is my second introduction to Bastille that led to me being a stormer. The film sucks in multiple dimensions (including stereotypes/homophobia) and is placed in an awkward position, but the song is brilliant.

>The other half just don't care, you see

>You don't wanna fuck with us
British to the very last

These lines are very interesting. When using the comma, it would be understood as people being ignorant to problems. However, by removing the comma, it is understood as that the other half is not only just as mad, but it is even madder since it is not even afraid of exposing the worst side of it. I have been interpreting with the second one and had only discovered the first one after checking the lyrics.

When the two lines below connect together, it really seems like nonsense. This is because we would tend to interpret the second line as trying to ignite a sense of hope by connecting with all the citizens of a nation. But when I first heard of this line, I was shocked. I had thought that British to the VERY last meant extreme nationalism. And this actually makes some sense. British is just used as a way not to offend others by bringing out Dan own's nationality. And then the first line would be about refusing to accept people of other nationality (eg immigrants), and this line would have a defensive tone. Nevertheless, both the two interpretation would match with the soft and delicate melody, the first being non-resolute due to the loss of hope, while the other being a sigh to the current mentality of people.


>Another man holding a microphone
Trying to say something at all
Or finding himself on an empty road
Trying to choose which way to go

>And so, you wanna make some money?
You wanna make some money
So, you wanna be somebody?
You wanna make some money

After seeing such disaster, even politicians that somehow could fake everything through (Fake It, emotion)is left  speechlesss. Everything seems to be destroyed at once, leaving empty roads and empty futures. Politicians have to choose between solutions and direct the country, even that they are just as unprepared and devastated. There seems to be no future for the country, given the empty road.

We live in such a materialistic world, that if we aim to get a living, we would get nothing else (no contribution to the world) but some cash. If we aim to be someone great, it has to be something related to money. Our dreams are shattered by the harsh reality, that activists do not really get a future and are often suppressed, and other meaningful jobs are equally impossible to get.


>So tell me what's the news
And what is it you want me to see
We're lying to ourselves
And dancing by the light of the screen

This reflects the echo chambers of our society. We are just lying to ourselves despite all the harsh truth. We are just choosing news that prove our stances, that we enjoy reading. Or in another prospective, our news sources are often biased. Intervention from the government (in some places) is frequent, and the truth is hidden away.


So this is my disorganized bunch of analysis. Talking about the flim Bright, it attempts to reflect social issues such as police brutality, racism, segregation. Strangely relatable for us, huh? The recent Minneapolis news, the lasting Hong Kong and Chilean protests. (Sighs) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Don't you dare miss eh eheu eh eheu! I am thoroughly amazed that even this chant can have a deep meaning. And a latin one? Genius. Even my sister is amazed by this and is impressed with Bastille.

This song is almost thoroughly discussed through Genius, so I am only picking some sentences that are worth mentioning but not analyzed.


>And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like
You've been here before?

So after removing the visual stimulations, we are able to reflect our past. There are simply so many hints that the disaster would happen, that we have almost been through this again and again.


>We were caught up and lost in all of our vices

Vices mean our immoral behavior, criminal activities, and our flaws. Wait. Yes, flaws. This can be a double entendre. On one hand, people of Pompeii perceived the event that they deserve it because they believed it was a punishment from god. On the other hand, both sides of a relationship are caught up with the flaws in the relationship, how they would not end up making this disaster, after the dust settled, i.e. the disaster has happened. So in the song, this lyric is connected with rubble or sin. When it comes to Bastille songs, this can be related to Flaws or even Torn Apart.

Notice how Bastille uses "devices" in verse one, and "vices" in verse two. Quite a nice word choice to connect the song and make it coherent.

During the quarastream, Dan changes our vices into devices. Quite strange that it even sounds similar. It is intentional to use devices as a reference to "left to my own devices". So does it mean that we sometimes perceive mobile phones as inappropriate, given the original meaning of the sentence?

In terms of musical analysis, notice how Bastille uses percussion in 1:57 in music video. It is between darkness from above and but if you close your eyes. I would always perceive it as the beating and racing heart upon hearing a disaster, a news that break us into a million pieces. Then the narrator would try to comfort himself through closing eyes and temporarily escape from reality.


What about the music video? It seems unrelated. Depends on how you understand it. This might be the struggle of the narrator to escape from the disaster. But see that black eye at the end? It is impossible to escape, just like the volcanic eruption. Death is inevitable when you are already seeing the burning hot pyroclaustic materials (volcanic ash) settling around you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really appreciate that you would try and challenge your thoughts. It takes a long journey to fully understand how social movements work and resonate and understand how people react. Even I myself have to be educated deeply to understand concepts like sex vs gender.

Things are never black-and-white. I do wish people, regardless of whether they are the "privileged" or the oppressed, to realize how their words have a huge impact on others. A misleading statement could be perceived as hate speech or alienating others. No matter we are of what race, religion, sexuality, sex, gender, occupation, political position, etc , we still have the need to consider other's feelings. Maybe they aren't meant to direct hatred, they just have different values. There is no absolute right or wrong.

This is my first delta here, thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a GRSM and I totally understand your point. It sometimes frustrates me, along with other "reverse hatred" like "white culture" or "ACAB". I would not consider myself as racist or supportive of all actions of the police, but things are not really that simple. We really have to be careful not to alienate our supporters.

But think of it this way: If you are oppressed after so many years by (assumingly) the same group of people, you deserve to be angry at them. It is perfectly understandable to "hate" the oppressors alongside with the rest of the group, even if the members of the group are not all oppressors. It might even be a biological instinct. It is important to be empathetic towards minorities or oppressed groups. I am also "privileged" that I am at least cis, non-racial minority in my country, and a male. But if a feminist comes to rant about men, it is important to be think in their own perspective, that they are just angry but rarely man-hating.

Also, are you sure that they are "hating on hetero people"? Is it? Are they just talking about homophobia/transphobia/etc. by referring to cishets? It is very rare to see a GRSM actually refusing to communicate with cishets or throwimg curses/disrespectful speeches like "You guys are unpleasantly disgusting. I mean, is cishet natural?" They are just referring to the specific transphobes/homophobes/etc. This is because when we are ranting, we would not really consider what every single person is. We would just use general terms.

When it comes to our sexuality or gender, it is such a shame that we could not talk rationally and use specific and accurate terms, even that it is understandable. This is a problem among many activism movements. But after all, we are not actually activists. We might not be careful in every word that we use in order not to mislead/confuse/alienate others.

And then I think unlike the special case of the police that endures hate crimes/suicides/murders every day, I believe cishets have the mental capacity to handle this hatred that comes from generally criticising cishets (but actually just focusing on misconceptions in some particular cishets).

I might not be direct enough towards your arguments, but this is how I view this and similar issues. I think I would be at a controversial position in some points, but there you are.

Edit: Incorrect word choice

Edit 2: I welcome people to challenge my thoughts (instead of plain downvoting). I know I am in a controversial stance here, and I suppose it is about ACAB. How I am hypocritical that my rights are gained against the police but I seemingly support all of them, right? Or about white culture, I assume? I suppose I shouldn't use the example of white culture since I am not a US citizen. But of course there might be a time lag if a conversation is started. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yep. The name comes from my childhood favourite character which contributes to my realization that I am not straight. I do not even need to hide my name because this basically misleads 80% of Redditors here.

I wish to go to Wyoming someday though. I bet it is a common dream among geology enthusiasts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello cultists!

I am Rex and I'm a 16-year-old teen from Hong Kong. You might have seen me participating in the daily song discussions. Basically I am easily nervous and highly sensitive to everything, including emotions of other people, sounds (especially sounds), movements, flavours, scents, etc. I sometimes can detect electronic devices through headaches, and I have no idea how it works. I am currently studying Biology, Chemistry and Geography at school, and I hope to achieve a near-impossible dream of having a geology-related job in the future in HK. I enjoy hiking and I love collecting interesting rocks, even though there aren't many in Hong Kong. Bird watching and seeing interesting insects ( I LOVE SPIDERS AND I KNOW IT'S WEIRD) are also nice. I have two cats and sometimes I consider myself as a cat too. I play the piano and the violin.

I knew of Bastille when I wandered on Youtube in 2014. I loved Pompeii, but I did not take note of this band at that time. I was wandering on Youtube again in 2017 and saw World Gone Mad trending. I thought 'hmm Bastille. Let me try this. ', and at that point, I became obsessed with this band. But really, I only discovered what a genius Bastille is recently, when I began to analyze songs on the daily discussions. I probably have mentioned this a lot of times, but how is that possible for Bastille to produce such well-rounded songs, with tons of double entendres, metaphors, musical devices and so on? Anyway, Bastille helped me get through many emotional outbursts as I listen to the chunk of songs from Weight of Living Pt.1 to Laughter Lines on ATBB every time I cry. I have been struggling with mental issues, and the emotional validation from Bastille (especially Albatross and Sleepsong) are crucial to me.

Favourite Bastille album: Wild World ( I still think it is a betrayal to my previous-favourite ATBB)

Favourite OPH: OPH2 (Especially Dreams, Free, No Angels and Basement)

Favourite Bastille songs in no particular order: Weight of Living Pt.1, Laughter Lines, Basement, Fake It, Those Nights, Remains

Favourite cover: Dreams and East Side, but I would probably change my mind if I listen to all the covers again.

My other musical tastes: I was a Swiftie before changing to EDM. Then it was Chopin and now I am stuck with Bastille. I occasionally listen to a handful of songs from Kodaline, Chopin and also songs from some musicals.

Red pill/blue pill: I think I would just stick to a blue pill. I am not quite sure if I could handle another devastating news that would break my heart into a million pieces.

Favourite country: the Netherlands (yay u/Tsreuvers ) because of how open-minded and kind-hearted people there are, and I also love Kruller Muller museum with the natural landscapes around it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really to my interpretation as a former Christian, the Christian God is non-binary. There is little description on what God's gender is. Jesus, a male, is simply a form of God. God should be a spiritual form that is agender, asexual, aromantic with no race. Or perhaps God is intersex, non-binary, pangender, panromantic, pansexual with no race. Either way, God is LGBTQ+/GRSM.

Christian god is non-binary, and non-binary people are god. Period. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The song is disturbing at first glance, but it turns out to be okay. To some extent.

The metaphor oil on water is a really good one. Like many people come to her only for sex with no desire of connecting with each other. They cannot conbine together. They are just disparate and separate, like oil on water, even if one is on top of each other.

I would feel that Dan has a neutral to somewhat negative and sorrowful attitude towards prostitution. He realizes that many prostitutes only come to this step because they desparately need money. A catalogue of modern mistakes, modern capitalism. He also reflects the moral conservation on prostitution, like she is someone's daughter. Would her parents be heartbroken when they know of their daughter's job? What your mother would say if she could see what we're doing now?

These prostitution and similar social stigmas have also been discussed in many other songs. What Would You Do. Free. Oil on Water. Basket Case. I would choose Oil on Water (and perhaps Free) among these songs. Oil on Water is so beautifully written, and every word captures the essence of sex work. It also creates an atmosphere of sexual desire throughout the song, not only with the breathing, but also with the instrumentals mixing with the slow minor tone.

This song is underrated, but I definitely understand why. The song carries a prominent weight, and the breathing sounds along with the end is quite unnerving. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really when I first saw the list, I was like, "it wasn't that hard". Then when I relistened some of my chosen songs, I was like "Am I listening to another song before? Really this song is so awesome why wouldn't it be my favorite instead?".

I would guess that Titanium and Earth Song/Common People would be among the most unpopular ones. But Dan's voice is really stunning in Earth Song, and I would just see the criticised background vocals as "common people singing". Titanium is almost a taboo here, but really it isn't that bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While analyzing songs, you should also note the vocal changes. From my prose reading experience, tones are important to establish a sense of a dialogue between different people. So, yes, I have discovered something in a song.

I mean, what a journey. Everytime I listen to Bastille, I understand or discover something new. Vocals. Singing techniques. References. Double/Triple/Quadruple entendres. Metaphors. Background instrumnetals. Ideology. I mean, wow. How many people in this world can be that creative? Nailing lyrics, vocals, subtle references, sense of literacy. Ahhhhh. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I found out that from these discussions, I enjoyed analyzing poetry and texts.

And there you go.

This song is clearly about Daniel in the Den in the Bible. Dan is not religious, but uses religious themes as inspiration.

>Moving along in a pace unknown to man

Religion is unknown to man, yet Daniel manages to move along with faith, with this unknown pace.

When I saw "felled", I initially thought that Dan was Grammatically incorrect. But no. Felled refers to cause [some structure, regime, etc.] to fall. Just as Daniel caused the ones he thought he loved to cripple from power. Just as he used the power of faith to keep himself safe from the dark reality in the dead of the night.

This song seems to have multiple deeper meaning, so I find it hard to understand it. I somehow get some of it now though.

Daniel. What a coincidence! Daniel wrote a song about Daniel. Ha! It is intentional. I did not recall Daniel in Bible having a dream. (maybe he has, my bad memory) What is happening? Because Daniel is drinking in the den! Yes, double entendre. Daniel is the Bible character and Bastille member! Den refers to a pit and also a drinking bar!  (Which is why I felt confused when I looked up the dictionary and only got the bar meaning) Dainel's distraction from the lions
is faith, while Dan's distraction from adversity is drinking. Dan is drinking to distract from the harsh reality, possibly due to experiencing betrayal. Shadows and dreams are the hallucination from drinking. He refuses to move foward, that is why "go go go go go" is followed by "no no no no no".


>And you thought the lions were bad
Well they tried to kill my brothers
And for every king that died
Oh they would crown another
And it's harder than you think
Telling dreams from one another
And you thought the lions were bad
Well they tried to kill my brothers

So basically he is subtly saying what doesn't kill you makes you stronger in the first two lines. Adversity tries to kill Dan off, but they can be innocuous or even beneficial if a suitable method is used. Is drinking a suitable method? Not really. See Icarus falling. Dreams is another double entendre. Dreams can be literally dreams while sleeping or hallucinating. Dreams can also refer to aspirations and faith. King can refer to different people helping you in our lives. These helping hands are always changing. They would crown another. So there will always be help.

>Dreaming along in a pace you'll understand

Aspirations are slowly progressing because of all the troubles in life. We will understand and sympathize with facing all the weight of living in life.

>Oh to see
What it means to be free
Of the shadows and the dreams
That you claim to see

Shadows are the adversity, and dreams are hallucinations. (Perhaps dreams can be aspirations as well ahhhh) Can alcoholism free us? Perhaps, but it would also leading to us falling like Icarus. Falling from heaven, from grace, from happiness.


WHAT THE HECK WHAT A JOURNEY. DOUBLE ENTENDRES AND METAPHORS HERE ARE OVERWHELMING.


Connections to other songs:

Send Them Off! (both religious, both caused by jealousy (Daniel in Bible is prosecuted due to jealousy), Icarus (alcoholism), basically all of BB, Dreams cover? (relationship broken due to betrayal?) </TEXT>

<TITLE> How would the proposed National Security Law on Hong Kong affect the political environment on Hong Kong? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-05-23 05:43:05 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> It is said by the Chinese government that due to the recent Anti-Extradition Protests, local “terrorism” and the disrespect on China’s flag have been ‘rampant’. Some protest leaders have been begging foreign forces to intervene with the local politics, thereby seriously eroding the One Country, Two Systems in HK. As a result, the “Decision to establish and improve a legal framework and enforcement mechanism for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR” has been proposed and would be voted on the National People’s Congress on 28th May, 2020. It is widely expected that a consensus to put forward the proposed law would be achieved.

&#x200B;

The draft comprises of 7 articles, including:

1. The country shall comprehensively implement the policy of “One country, two systems” and the high degree of autonomy that Hong Kong enjoys, while maintaining the constitution and the constitutional order established by the HKSAR Basic Law. It shall also establish a sound legal system in the HKSAR to maintain national security, preventing and penalizing activities that endanger national security.

2. The country objects to any foreign interference to the affairs of the HKSAR, and will employ any necessary counter-measures, preventing and penalizing any foreign activities in Hong Kong aiming for secession, subversion, penetration, and destruction.

3. It is the constitutional responsibility of the HKSAR to maintain the sovereignty and unity of the country. The HKSAR shall legislate national security law according to the Basic Law as soon as possible. The executive, legislature, and judiciary of the HKSAR shall prevent and penalize actions that endanger national security according to the related law.

4. The HKSAR shall construct a sound organisation and mechanism to maintain national security, and reinforce the work of maintaining national security. Organizations in the Central People’s Government responsible for national security may set up organizations in the HKSAR in order to fulfill the responsibility of maintaining national security.

5. The HKSAR chief executive shall periodically submit a report on the work of maintaining national security, education on national security, and prohibition of actions endangering national security.

6. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is authorized to enact laws in order to build a sound legal system in the HKSAR to maintain national security and to prevent and penalize foreign interference of Hong Kong affairs and any actions that endanger national security such as sesscion, subversion, and organization of terrorism acts. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decides to list the aforementioned laws into the Annex III of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, which is to be enforced by the HKSAR.

7. This decision is effective starting from the day of announcement.

&#x200B;

Discussion directions:

1. Plausibility of implementing the draft

a. How likely would the draft be able to blend into the current constitutions of HK? Does it contradict any Basic Law, such as the laws protecting the freedom of speech? Does any of the content repeat any of the Basic Law on national security?

b. How likely would the draft be able to withstand public opposition? It is given that a protest will be held on 24th May, Sunday. Would the protest be overwhelming enough to deter the CCP from putting forward the draft? How likely is the draft to be able to withstand against the expected judicial reviews? And how would Western governments react to the draft, affecting the implementation of the draft?

&#x200B;

2. Political impacts of implementation (with the assumption that the draft is not being challenged)

a. Would implementing the draft limit Hong Konger’s freedom of speech, as some pro-protest supporters claimed? Or would the law only cover ‘actual terrorists’ and would not have any affect on the general public, as pro-government supporters claimed? To what extent would the Basic Law be able to protect citizen’s freedom of speech against potential national security departments?

b. Would the draft change the political landscape of Hong Kong? Pro-protest political organizations have declared to ‘reclaim’ the Legislative Council. To what extent would the law affect the potential outcome of this election that will be held in September? These pro-protest supporters have also gained control of 17 out of the 18 regions of District Council. Would the national security law change the ratio of pro-protest delegates to pro-government delegates?

&#x200B;

(You are reminded to keep the discussion civil. It is observed that Reddit generally has a pro-protest stance, but you are not encouraged to use strong emotional-loaded wordings such as wordings humiliating the Chinese/HK governments, or curses to Hong Kong Protesters.  I apologize for any Grammatical mistakes in the above texts.) </TEXT>

But you gave me a new perspective. Your interpretation easily explains your favorite line. The change of pronouns from "we" to "I" also makes sense. "we" is the pair of couple (but not society as a whole). Meanwhile, "I" is talking about the narrator specifically. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is the only song I know of that talks about climate change. Awesome.

I would guess that most of you would understand most of the lyrics, except the following:

>And can't you see it on the horizon
Then he opens up his question to the floor

Horizon refers to the rising horizons from the rise of sea level. The floor is used to talk about who has the right to speak in a formal discussion. So political leaders. It is always the political leaders who turn a blind eye to climate change and global warming. It is always them that lead us astray. To "open the floor to questions" means to allow people to ask questions in a large meeting. By reversing the order, the song might mean simply to ask a question.


>It's such a big wheel to try and turn
But in his final hour it's worth it

A big wheel is an influential person. We are turning an influential leader that ignores environmental issues to change their stance. A big wheel might also be a serious issue, climate change, in this instance. When a big wheel meets a downslope, it is unstoppable. We are trying to reverse climate change by turning the big wheel upwards. Double entendre (I found the right word! Not double meaning) or a pun.


>Come on, come on, don't stop a-running with me

This is interesting and allows open interpretation. I would guess that running refers to running away from the shores due to rising sea levels. Running can emphasize the urgency of the situation, that we are running around to solve climate emergency. Repetition of "come on" further emphasizes urgency.


>Would it keep you awake if the gun you love was turned at you one day?

I LOVEEEE this epic sentence. Really epic. A metaphor used brilliantly. Gun you loved is our fossil fuels. We love fossil fuels because it is relatively cheap. But this gun is turning against us one day, because fossil fuels produnce so much greenhouse gases and would lead to our doom. CO2, SO2, NO2, CO, CH4, you name it. Fossil fuels are also used as a diplomatic weapon. Energy diplomacy. US might rely on the middle east for oil, so the US has to appease the countries for oil. Shale gas is used in the US as well. The selling of fuels raises the international influence of a country, and is the gun countries love. On the other hand, nuclear power is an alternative energy source, but there is a darker side to it. It is still an unsustainable energy source. Nuclear power users might also use the technology behind to make nuclear weapons. Not to mention the nuclear wastes and accidents.

I mean, WOW. WOW. Bastille ia genius.


Finally, are we just going to leave the gun unresolved, leaving it to be turned against us? Are we going to turn a blind eye to environmental issues? Or should we take actions, both by urging large companies to obey environmental regulations, and reducing energy usage ourselves? You know the answer.

And I want to promote r/BastilleCult here. It is a new subreddit that talks about applying the teachings of our glorious Bastille to our daily lives. I might start a discussion on climate change later. </TEXT>

What would you do if your son is at home, crying alone on the bedroom floor. And he's hungry, and the only way to feed him is to sleep with a man with a little bit of money. And his daddy's gone. In another lockdown I ain't got a job now, he's just smoking rock now. (What Would You Do)

12. You realize that the only way to be happy is to limit your amount of watching the news and connect with your living loved ones: Hold me in this wild, wild world. 'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be, and in your heat I feel how cold it can get. Hold me in this wild, wild world. 'Cause in your warmth I forget how cold it can be, and in your heat I feel how cold it can get. Now draw me close...

So come on, let's forget the emotion. Tie the blinkers on
Hold both hands right over my eyes. Deafen me with music (Warmth)

You're the light that is blinding me. You're the anchor that I tie to my brain. 'Cause when it feels I am lost in sea, you're the song I sing again and again. (The Anchor) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Extending the biological sex and gender thing further, I would  interpret it like this:

Biological sex is *very roughly* about what body parts you have, what your inherent secondary sexual characteristics are. Think of it as biology.

Gender is about what kind of chemicals and structure you have in your brain. It is a strong and imperative feeling that you have, that ignoring it would potentially cause serious mental problems. Think of it as psychology impacted by biology. Like it can be an extrovert/introvert/ambivert thing. Roughly. The difference is that gender is inherently given and is fixed even as a person has different experiences. Gender fluid exists though. People are welcome to change their gender identity to find the best one that suits themselves.

There might be a handful of biological sex, but genders are basically a mess. It is very difficult to organize them, or to understand what it feels like to be another gender. That is why you would have a bunch of genders. Male, female, non-binary, two spirits, agender, bigender, polygender, pangender, gender fluid, unigender, etc.

I had been new to sex vs gender, and I find it difficult to understand the definitions brought by Google. I hope it helps. </TEXT>

They include "It's the End of the World as we know it", "Bang Bang (My baby shot me down)" and "East Side".There are at least 3 versions of Oh Holy Night (Tuning Out, BBC and OPH) with the Christmas Mashup, so it might be a bit tricky. I would suggest Making Tuning Out and OPH as one option, BBC as another, and Christmas Mashup as the third option. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Heroes: straight, white, male, cisgender, hypermasculine, strong, lack of sympathy to people of different ideology. Add some points for being mega-rich.

Villains: actually have some diversity, can be black, Asian, non-binary, transgender, sexual minorities, Islam, sometimes actually fighting for a good cause but with inappropriate methods. Is Cool.

And I especially hate the typical scene/plot where the heroes crashes into villain's lair to save their female partner being kidnapped, brutally and unnecessarily kills all villains sidekicks even when some are basically unable to fight. I mean, just have some sympathy, man. They might just be misleaded by the main villain and are manipulated. But no. Boom boom pew pew all villains dead. Or perhaps the main villain escapes, and then it is a sequel. I am glad that Hollywood and Netflix at least attempts to change the stereotypical plot. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I love how Switzerland gained the chaotic neutral Italy. However I have to mourn for my favourite European country the Netherlands. Why is the Netherlands conquered, when Albania still existed? I have nothing against Albanians, but do not expect Albania as a country to be able to withstand foreign invasion for a long time.(sobs)

I also feel that the situation would be extremely messed up when Israel conquered the whole of Jerusalem. I would expect Israel to gain Sinai Peninsula and most of Lebanon. Meanwhile, Palestine unites with Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia and fight against Israeli forces alongside with Egypt. Saudi Arabia threatens to permanently stop all oil supplies to USA if US helps Israel in large extent, thereby preventing US from interfering. Iran, Iraq unites with the "stans" to form a large nation, providing limited help to the Palestinians. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It actually makes sense! From a biology perspective, water is involved in hydrolysis, which is involved in digestion. After digestion, glucose as the end product can be used in respiration to release energy. (Still learning, correct me if I am wrong) Tea, coffee and energy drinks contain caffeine. Caffeine provokes us to produce urine, so we would end up losing water in the long term. Alcohol in wine is harmful, especially to the liver where detoxification occurs. Therefore, water is almost always the best choice.

We need an abundant supply of water. After all, we are made up largely of water (blood is ~90% water). The requirement of water varies from person to person. If you have large meals, you may need to drink more water. If you exercise, water is lost from sweat and you would need to drink more water. You can get a bit of water from fruit and vegetables, but that is not enough for humans. Fruit and vegetables contain sugar (fructose, glucose...) and vitamins (ascorbic acid, that is vitamin C), which lower water potential in blood and you would feel thirsty anyway. Not that we have to force water into our throats, but staying hydrated is important regardless.

Main functions of water: as transport medium, as medium for chemical reactions to take place, as temperature buffer, as cooling agent, as supporting agent(not applicable in humans) </TEXT>

Eg. Choose love T-shirt: Help refugees

4. Spread Bastille teachings through actions

Eg. Participate in marathons with charity causes, overthrow hypocritical monarchies (haha kidding, but...?) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am against many of Trunp's ideology, political strategies, attitudes and policies. However I am tired of people from the liberal side accusing the conservatives to be prone to disinformation, while some are falling into misleading headlines frequently. It seems that some liberals are falling into intergroup bias themselves.

Take this as an example. I am not an American, but it seems that MSNBC News is not a great source either. From [Fact Check / Media Bias](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mediabiasfactcheck.com/msnbc/%3famp),

>In review, MSNBC uses strong emotional loaded headlines such as this “GOP senator says he’s ‘concerned’ Trump was ‘involved in a crime” and “Cohen gets 3 years in jail for covering up Trump’s ‘dirty deeds’”. Generally, story selection favors the Left, however they are also occasionally criticized by left leaning organizations. 

Dirty needs. Wow, I mean.

>Lastly, in a 2018 survey conducted by the Knight Foundation/Gallup, they found that the public rates MSNBC the 3rd most biased media source (left) behind Fox News and Breitbart (right).

It would be too black-and-white and biased to say that " MSNBC doesn't respect you and is trying to manipulate the story in how it is presented and framed, rather than just presenting information and letting you, a respected person, make up their mind" though. Using one example only without other sources and evidences is not very convincing, and it is difficult to say that a media disrespects readers by manipulating stories. But what a shame that conservatives are almost the only ones realizing that the article is misleading while presenting their political views.

I am not a fan of r/politics, but I have to laugh after I see the rules claiming that the sub is for civil conversation. How civil when top comments used strongly emotional loaded wording, and unpopular opinions or facts are downvoted into controversial (like this one). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Limonite could be brittle. Geology typically uses mohs scale. The higher a mineral is on the scale, the harder it is with diamand (10) being the hardest. Limonite has a scale of around 4 to 5, so it might be scratched with a steel nail.

I personally do not see the common iron oxide (iron iii oxide, haematite, reddish brown) here. Some parts may be more brittle than the others due to lines of weaknesses and prolonged periods of weathering. Not sure though.

An interesting experiment you can do to the rock is add just a little bit of HCl (common alternative would be vinegar, though less effective) to the malachite and see if it fizzes. Malachite fizzes if the rock is cleared of dirt. Vinegar is less effective, so the results are not very reliable. I did once to a malachite rock that was identified here previously. It fizzed the first time and did not the second time.

Really, I am hoping not to be seen as an expert since my rock geology courses have not even started and I am just playing around enthusiastically. But yeah, enjoy your rock. Nice find! Malachite could be common for experienced rock hoarders, but it is definitely very exciting for me. </TEXT>

Wild journey including all the musicians mentioned here. I was the "I like Bad Blood, but the Taylor Swift one" type, but now I am the opposite. I was once the annoying "isn't Bastille the 'eh eh oh' one?"trope. If I were still in the EDM stage when Happier was released, I might be saying that Happier is a Marshmello song featuring Bastille. I am the one touching all the annoying outsider traits narrowly lol.

 Look how drastically my musical tastes have changed, but I would bet that I would not be able to leave the Bastille rabbit hole. I am not only a Stormer, but an obsessed Stormer, so the current stage is different from the previous ones. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This song is very un-bastille in terms of instrumentals with repetitive and too straightforward lyrics. I would prefer Pompeii very much to replace the fame of Happier, like double the fame. I am out-of-touch with mainstream music, but perhaps Fake It could also make it out to be famous instead of Happier. But somehow I still find connections with other Bastille songs.

>In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun

The only lyric here that is not straightforward. A metaphor. Does it sound familiar? Yes, it does. A reference to Things We Lost in the Fire. The double meaning of flame (passion and argument). I am a bit confused on the lyric. What does it try to explain? I am surprised that Genius does not have a single annotation on the lyrics of such a mainstream song. Cold could mean desperation, light could mean hope (You're the light that is blinding me, The Anchor). Beginning a fire could mean igniting an argument. But flame in the wind? Transporting destruction? The passion of a relationship extinguishing by the strong wind (adversity)?


>And the image of you being with someone else
Well, that's eating me up inside
But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay
Now if we jump together at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

The first part is jealousy, the green-eyed monster. Send Them Off! Pretending that we are okay. Very relatable and is referencing Fake It, perhaps. Swimming. This is probably unrelated, but this is about waters again. Perhaps The Waves, like escapism. (The Currents is mainly about politics but could be plausible.)


If the lyrics is not as repetitive, I might like this song. Definitely not as good as the true Bastille songs, but I am very annoyed that the same lyrics keep repeating, and the repeating lyrics is not that great either. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some cases of watching too much news include when news is becoming some kind of trigger of mental health issues. Some would scroll on news pages for hours, obsessed with updates, feels guilty and "uninformed" when not reading the news. This would be problematic. Being informed is not watching too much news, but yes, there is something as watching too much news. Not directed against anyone in particular, just wanted to add something to the discussion here.

While I observe that many people in US or other Western countries are uneducated and watch too few news articles, people in Hong Kong or in Tumblr (in general and in the trending posts but not all) are too anxious on "being informed". It should be scrutable since Hong Kong has been hit by SARS severely in 2003, so that some people are hyper aware of disease protection. I believe we should address both sides of the issue, of those being too ignorant and those being to anxious. Stay informed but not too much. (eg severely interfering with your daily schedule, too anxious and hyperventilating after watching the news) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would view this map from a hydrology aspect, but I hope I am not too inaccurate.

Like someone has suggested here, two rivers would not meet then split immediately afterwards, which means that one of the rivers are man-made channels.

Then it is the straightness of the rivers. Rivers, especially the middle and lower courses, would rarely be be very straight due to meanders present unless it is viewed in a very macro or very micro scale. This indicates that perhaps the rivers are straightened due to major channelization efforts. With the large scale required, this might mean that the city is extremely (over)populated and is very prosperous. Or perhaps the city's development is concentrated on two banks of the river, then is expanded outwards, which is somewhat like Nile is like. Is the urban planning of the more ancient part be less well-thought and messy, making the lower classes concentrated on living there? Or is the urban planning of it be as good as the more modern parts of the city due to the early development, making it as a CBD? </TEXT>

I sometimes would find myself singing this lyric in my head. This lyric for me is a bit cool. Anyway, it reminds me of Grip and another song that I only have a vague impression of resembling this lyric.

<TEXT> The song is talking about the narrator struggling with pressures from others or from perfectionism of himself. I would prefer to think of the later, as I would consider the lyrics here:

>And I will never do the things you want me to
But I will never write the way you do

He feels like the person/perfectionism is forcing him to do something impossible, like turning simple objects (words and melody) to gold (perfect song) in alchemy. Metaphor here.

I think the music video is only trying to establish a surreal atmosphere, like we would imagine when we look at alchemy. This could also be Dan being so immersed into his thoughts that he becomes delusional (not likely?). Note how he shows himself playing the piano, something that is not shown in any of Dan/Bastille's other MVs. This is due to the creativity and music making theme of the song. It reminds me of Twenty One Pilots' music video Chlorine. Meeting impossible demands.

The video makes use of very simple editing skills, so the objects would be moving incoherently. This is why some would laugh at the video, saying it is cringe, but I quite enjoy it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This MV has the most emotional impact on me among all the MVs I have watched in my lifetime.

Trigger warning: (suicides)




The video shows the viewpoint of a detective/police officer. He travels everywhere to investigate the deaths of different people during night shifts, with most of them being suicide. He sees so much death, that he slowly becomes depressed, and the deaths become a routline and the rhythm of the  night. The corpse feel like they are speaking, sympathizing with his situation, asking him to join them. He becomes delusional as he becomes more and more depressed. You could see that he is desperately trying to tell what the reality is as he rubs against his face. Finally, he couldn't stand all the suicidal thoughts and joins the dead he sees along the way. A more detailed explanation could be find in the Youtube comments, I believe. More relationships of lyrics and the video, as well as the song with other songs, could be discussed during the daily song discussion.




Sorry for making this political (Dan is political anyway, it is inevitable), but this is why I think we should be empathetic towards our police officers. They see so much the darkest corners of society, that they are very vulnerable to suicides, alcholism, drugs and even becoming criminals themselves. Really, this is what the *original* Thin Blue Line is about. If we push them towards the edges and say ACAB, we are eventually hurting the police community, even if ACAB might have a more complex meaning behind it. Please acknowledge the good deeds the police has done to society while codemning their corruption, racism, homophobia or hatred in general. And if we leave their only supporters as  the haters, they would turn to the haters as well, and we would have a deteriorating police brutality situation. That is why you may see me begging others to not blindly hate the police and ask them to watch the video (labelled trigger warning). We are all having a hard time, but we still have to carefully decide our thoughts and action as not to worsen our situation. Call me despicable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really think this has some of Bastille's most unclearly written lyrics. It has little space for exploration, unlike Fake It. But it has beautiful instrumentals, so it balances out.

Oblivion is the state of being forgotten and is usually used when talking about death. So the narrator's subject, I assume is someone close (head upon my shoulder), is suicidal (oblivion is calling) and is frequently lost in their thoughts (mind going somewhere deeper). The subject (they) are ashamed of themselves (hide your face). The narrator is therefore deeply afraid for them. Are they going to leave me behind? (leave a path to trace).


Now the hard part that I am not sure.

>You always take it further
Than I ever can
When you play it hard
And I try to follow you there
It's not about control
But I turn back when I see where you go

Perhaps the suicidal person is already too far out of reach (take it further) and that it is hopeless to do anything (Then I ever can). Perhaps the suicidal person hides their emotions by "playing it hard", like acting tough. But this reaction is noticed by the narrator (try to follow you there, where there is the person's mind and emotions). He tries to convince the person that the narrator is not trying to manipulate the person, like the person might have experienced before. Now I could not figure out what the last sentence here means.


Connections to other songs (IMPORTANT):

1. Flaws (see that screen in Oblivion's MV?) Perhaps the narrator is also trying to convince the person to accept their flaws.

2. The Draw / Sleepsong. It is the perspective from the suicidal person. Some other songs include Get Home.

3. The Silence. It is the perspective from the narrator.

4. (NOT SURE) Laughter Lines. Like the narrator from LL is convincing the narrator to "see you in the future", not to give up, that they would be wiser and happier with "stories to be told".


Honestly the whole BB is mainly about mental illnesses. WW is politics and religion, while DD is escapism and apocalypse. All BB songs are entangled in some way to the other. </TEXT>

Do not connect with toxic friends (once you confirm that they are and do not have any underlying intentions) even if you are lonely. You would not drink poison even when you are thirsty.

Sometimes it is hard to improve yourself. But you will succeed eventually. Off days are okay and are the most important process sometimes.


What we need to distinguish is what is the meaning of selfish. Selfish is putting your wants over somebody's needs. Self care is putting your needs (mental health) over someone's wants (being toxic). Being selfish for a short period is okay as long as you realize that it is wrong and corrects it such as by apologizing.

(Selfish = your wants > other's needs

Selfless= other's needs > your wants

Sacrifice = your needs < other's needs

Passiveness = your needs < other's wants ( Pls do not fall into this trap)

Assertiveness = your needs = other's needs) </TEXT>

Perhaps if you decide not to transfer, you could try to connect with all the "weirdos" or people sitting in the corner. Sometimes those are just a bit lonely and awkward, but they could be wonderful people.

Another thing I am proud of is that you are able to make steps towards improvement. Debates are still difficult for me , as I prefer much civil and relaxing conversations (eg in CMV). If you successfully involve yourself in it, you really should be proud of yourself. It is even more impressive that you could stop yourself from bullying, with whatever means. Perhaps you have quite some social skills, it is just that you are trapped with toxic people.

One thing I would suggest you to try though, is to be sympathetic and look at other people's perspectives. Sometimes they are not intentionally being mean, they are just not good at using words. You could try a useful technique. 1. Expressing sympathy for people's reactions and experiences 2. Find something to praise them (eg I appreciate that you care about this social issue a lot, that you are willing to voice your opinions out loud) 3. Acknowledge your own feelings (eg But I feel hurt by your words) 4. Suggesting solutions


Good luck! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I also wish you can change my mind. Even if the police organization is problematic, we could not simply get rid of the police organization. If we just say how ACAB, we are just worsening the relationship between cops and citizens. Like those good cops insisting to do their job well might as well get alienated. If all those people supporting cops are the far right biased community, they might turn to these communities as well.


ACAB statement, at least by its surface meaning, is just focusing on behavioral issues of the police. It really does not help raising awareness on the foundation problems (eg corruption) of the police a lot. Instead, we should just support them when they did something good, and condemn their actions (not personal attacks or attacking police in general) when they are oppressing minorities or doing other unreasonable crimes. I believe changes would only start to happen when the Police receive the correct supportive community that actually helps them to improve instead of supporting every single action they do.


Police is one of the most vulnerable communities to crime as well, not matter how hard it is to admit this. They face so many suicides, murders, thievery, etc. I think this slightly depressing video shows what the police faces. Might be a trigger, I assume. Suicidal behavior is shown. (Please get help if you are suicidal as well. I do not know much about help lines in the US, but the Samaritans HK is a helpline for HK.

[Rhythm of the Night (of the daily schedules of the Police)](https://youtu.be/ZCTDKLjdok4)


It is incorrect to shun them by using ACAB. They would feel like we are just turning them away, when the surface meaning of ACAB seems to be just purely hatred to Police, in spite of what it means underneath. We have to make them understand that we emotionally support them, but also expose their flaws at the same time.  Institutional changes can only occur if there is little resistance in the Police community as well. Perhaps we can treat them less harshly, or at least first acknowledge their hard work before constructively criticise the behaviour of some (but not all) Police.


This is the point I have been repeating many times on Reddit. Each time I would expect downvotes, because each time I do not expect anyone to accept this view. Like Thin Blue Line is used as a far-right bigoted flag, but its intentions are still good. We could reclaim the thin blue line like we did to the originally slur but now positive "queer". We could reclaim the Police community like we did to many other communities. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I heard the teaser of the song, I initially expected it to be a serene song, perhaps like 4AM. But what was I thinking? It has to be about partying all night. I was a bit disappointed, but it has grown on me since then.

>You put your arms around me
Partners in crime in the dead of night
It's our weekend religion
A different chord but the same refrain

Partners in crime seems to be pretty interesting. What crimes exactly? It reminds me of the Glory music video. The couple, I assume, is nicking cars all the time. But these crimes are only imaginary and happened in one of the person's brain. So these "crimes" might not actually be crimes. It might only mean that they enjoy time together and perhaps do naughty stuff together. Alternatively, it might also mean they were not allowed to be together and them being together was seen as a crime. They only reached out for each other at the weekends, and they did almost the same thing again and again.


>We received the freedom but we were completely unaware what to do with this freedom
It felt like the hungry people received the foods and we just ate everything

A quote commenting the reaction of Russians to the collapse of USSR. They only indulged themselves in Western entertainment and escapism instead of establishing solid foundations for political stability and long-lasting democracy. Perhaps this could only be applied to some Gen Z and millennials including the narrators. They were too busy entertaining that they grew uninterested in participating politics. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I would love to participate in the "changing mindset" thing as long as it is a conversation but not a debate. I would try to be open to different opinions as long as strong emotional words, foul languages or hostile attitude are not present (I might block you if I feel that you are being intentional hostile to only me.)  In other words, just try to be nice and understanding, especially when it comes to mental health and minorities. These CMV conversations can be interesting only if both sides are respecting the other.

I genuinely think that everyone is a bit of an oddball and has some darker thoughts hidden from view. Of course it might be just me. I do have some disturbing thoughts sometimes, but people would say that as long as you do not act on them, challenge the mindsets, and you at least care whether you would harm others or not, it is mostly fine. I also sometimes  have trouble connecting with my peers, but I find it easier to talk to people older than me. I hate small talks and sometimes people would think I am too serious, and this is why I feel like a misfit when at school. Sometimes we just need to break out of our regular relations to feel like we are unique and comfortable at the same time.

Well, with your deterrence honestly I am a bit reluctant to have a chat (I hope I will not regret this). Perhaps we could just test the waters first? Are you desperate for a solid conversation, or are you just looking for a temporary escapement? I also wonder how you would define darker content. Is it taboo social issues (eg prostitution)? Sex? Violence? Individual behaviour deemed inappropriate such as gambling, taking drugs, pedophilia, gangbanging ? There is a wide range of darker content. Some I would feel comfortable with, while others might be unfamiliar or uncomfortable for me. I could easily feel uncomfortable sometimes, but with your description it seems to be absurdly okay.

(16M, yeah so please do not send me nudes or something like that. Talking about sex as individual experiences is not really comfortable for me, but the sex education / prostitution /sex-related social issues could be intriguing.) </TEXT>

When Dan begins to dial the girl's phone at 1:08, everything becomes messed up. And at 1:36, everything is a disaster. When we indulge in the memories of our dead ones, grief and all the craziness begins. But I notice that in 2:42, the girl who I assume Dan is grieving for is not happy. Perhaps the girl wants Dan to live and continue with his life instead of being stuck in the cycle of grief? Burning of the teddy bear might represent the destruction of childhood, so that the characters seem to be chasing for the doll? 0:22 shows a red car with no one in it? Red car part reminds me of Glory. We all know tht someone dies in Glory in a car crash in a red car, so it might be related? The part I think is important is the 3:23, the TV showing a man rescuing a woman. But I couldn't make any more sense. Does it mean when we grief, we desperately scramble through our memories just to preserve the memories of the one we are grieving for? Another detail I see is that no.5 and no.8 are not shown and mixed together. This video is even more confusing than I remember it to be. Does the numbers each represent memories? Or emotions? Or states of mind?

<TEXT> Insomnia keeping me up, so I am typing this.

Good Grief is indeed very catchy, and has a very relatable lyrics, so I am not surprised that this song is popular. Songs like Glory are not straightforward, so people might not understand the song and do not relate to them, so those songs are not as popular.

Good Grief has really straightforward lyrics that I have no idea what to explain. Except the quote which seems to be unrelated. We have to face difficulties before partying, and the difficulty is the death and grief? Is dressing up means that the have to go to the funeral, or that they are starting a new chapter?

The video on the other hand ia just confusing. Yeah, grief messes up our memories, but why use these particular tapes? Why a teddy bear? (I assume that people of all ages, including children, can experience grief.) Why telephones? (I assume that when we miss someone because they are dead, we would be desperate to contact them.) Why fire? (I assume it is the Things we Lost in the Fire, fire can be a symbol of destruction (death), or passion (lover).)  Why elevator? (Because we are having such a plummeting mood that it feels like it is an elevator taking us down?) Why robbers? (Because grief robs our memories) Why a lottery? (Simply a memory to bring out that grief messes even our happier memories? Wait I remember something I would check out on the video tmr) Why the drums? (The beating heart when we receive the news of death? Possibly a reference to Laura Palmer, this is your beating heart? That Palmer is dead?) Why jogging? Do the respective numbers represent anything? Ahhhhhhhhh. I couldn't believe that I figured some of them while typing. I have to watch the video again for details. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Tried NoFap but found out that I do not need it from my social worker.

It is okay to fap at a normal frequency, like if you do not feel troubled and your work hindered deeply by fapping. Fapping can relieve excess stress if you are not addicted, but can be dangerous if you become hypersexual. I have excess stress that I feel nervous all the time without reason, so I really need masturbation.

The only main thing that helps ALL NoFap-ers is its goal-setting nature. I would suggest to consider seriously if you need NoFap or not before doing so. Yeah, porn industry is not encouraging it, but there are also little reliable scientific evidence on the benefits of NoFap. Every study is on an early stage. Not that studies of the benefits of masturbation is on an early stage either. NoFap might have a positive effect in some way, but the shaming culture of some participants create a negative image to the media. Like it creates the mindset that any masturbation is very harmful and is a black hole. It is okay if you can control the frequency of it.

In one way or another, please do not shame yourself if you fail to achieve a goal or have a relapse. Goals are just long journeys and, you would have bumps and obstacles. And you would succeed eventually if you are determined. </TEXT>

It really feels like hell to have such a humid and hot weather. I enjoy learning geology, and the last experience of online chatting with a geologist is quite enjoyable. We would have just a little time lag, so it could be convenient even if our schedules are different. I would enjoy chatting online, but I might struggle to keep the conversation flowing.

To beifly introduce myself, I would be described as a "suspiciously atrabilious Stormer savouring stones". Sometimes I feel much older than my peers, like I already have dozens of frown lines. I love laughing if I could though, like I feel young and energized again.

<TEXT> The reason for this to happen is because rocks underneath are actively being weathered and eroded. Overtime, the area where waves are concentrated becomes a depression, forming a sea notch. Then when the base rocks could not handle carrying the large overhanging parts, the edges collapse in a large scale, that the lying person would have nothing to hold on to, not even their feet.

But hey, if the area is unsafe, there would not be so many people, or would not it be opened either. There are so many reasons that we could be worried of. What if the base of our homes are unstable. That it is hollow in structure, and collapses suddenly? What if a landslide triggered a tsunami, the waves crash into our fragile walls? We are so amazing, yet so fragile. But look, each of us have survived that long. It is unlikely for these to happen. What we have to do is to overcome these fears slowly and steadily. Showing these fears show that each of us is experiencing fear and is human, no matter how brilliant we may be on the outside. Listing the facts makes us understand all the potential risks and dangers. But at the end, we do not really have to worry about everything so deeply, no matter how hard it sounds. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I know if I comment this late, my comment would only be seen by OP. I am busy, but I still feel obligated to comment something here, especially when I have something to analyse in the song. This comment just organizes my random thoughts that might be forgotten by me later.


Firstly, who is the "you" here? Is the narrator speaking to someone specifically in front of them, or is it speaking humanity in general? I would think that it is used as to a specific person. Like "We used to swim in your stories
And be pulled down by their tide" seems to be talking very specifically.

This song talks about the narrator trying to convince someone to open up on something traumatic (hit a wall) the person has experienced. After all, it is not enough to be dumbstruck. We still have to overcome our challenges after we embrace our emotions. So almost every word here is trying to comfort and bring solace to the person. This really seems to be the perspective of a therapist. Songs from the other perspective would include Get Home and Sleepsong. Then The Draw would be talking about the reaction of the person the narrator is talking to. Interesting. The subject of the song may actually have opened up to the narrator, causing songs like 4AM or the Anchor.


>Pull the rug beneath my feet
And shake me to the ground

Pulling a rug. Something unexpected and catching a person off guard. So the narrator is willing to share the complex emotions of the subject here.

>Tell me a piece of your history
That you're proud to call your own

Sometimes, overcoming challenges, or the challenges themselves, becomes the most indelible and essential part of our identity, that we become proud of these past events.

(Ahhh the problem with Genius is that the beautiful but lesser known songs are not analysed at all.)

>We used to swim in your stories
And be pulled down by their tide
Choking on the words
And drowning with no air in sight

Reminds me of the Currents and the Waves. Or even the Bad Blood MV. Burying the past is Overjoyed, and releasing it is Flaws. This song is the in between. (Wait? Did I discover something?) </TEXT>

Wiith my limited knowledge (correct me if I am wrong), well jointed rocks (eg with more cracks structurally) tend to be weathered and eroded faster with the surface area of weathering being larger, which is why many sedimentary rocks with layers are not resistant to erosion. Less jointed rocks such as some conglomerates might be more resistant to erosion. </TEXT>

<TEXT> And when I try to reply something to your posts, I always find something new that I have not noticed before. :) While first writing the comment, I was thinking that there was nothing to add. But throughout the day I kept randomly realizing something, causing the creation of this chaotic explanation here. Dan really is a genius, and when he collaborates with Kyle, Woody, Will and Charlie, magic happens.

Being an early Stormer is a bit difficult, because initially you would be "wow this sounds neat", struggling to explore the mess of Bastille songs. Firstly it is just the singles from Bastille vevo, then you see another account with Overjoyed, Hangin' and a bunch of other songs(The accounts have been merged now though).After that it is the non-single songs like Icarus. Then you realize that the fucking covers are also awesome, and they are dispersed all over the Internet. And there are also songs that feature Bastille(La Luna) which are not in the Bastille channels. Afterwards you see the wild and confusing videos (Torn Apart really makes me laugh out loud, because what is happening, I thought this video would be a normal one.), making you question your reality, then just giving up and leaving without understanding it. Some years later, you would be listening to a song happily, then suddenly realize how depressing the song is. Or you notice another metaphor, another double meaning and symbolization. Or another lyrics painting, connection to a song and a conspiracy theory (The realization of Fake It some days ago hit me hard). I mean, I have been a Stormer for 3 years now, but there is still so much more to explore. The "WTF why haven't I noticed this" is one of the reasons I love Bastille. It is sometimes a headache, but it is enjoyable. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is my first song I fell in love with among all OPH songs. The Romeo and Juliet reference is just magnificent.

The meaning behind the song is well-explained in Genius at the moment for me. I have not watched Drive, so the area of interpretation is shrinked. But I loved the build-up of instruments in the song. It begins as a peaceful song, or perhaps slightly melancholic. But then "Big Boys don't cry" come along as a way for the narrator to suppress his (as in the Drive) feelings, and the feelings begin to loose control. The feelings continues to build up until everything collapses at 3:35 (where Dan adds another layer of harmony). This reminds me of Sleepsong and the Draw. All of these songs are talking about the narrator trying to suppress their feelings or are struggling to control them. Then unlike the Draw, the Driver does not end with drums fading out (heartbeats fading). It also does not feel similar to Sleepsong, where strings fade out, creating a regretful and irresolute end. I think the narrator becomes firm and determined, that he accepts "everything will change tonight".

Let us look at Youtube commentor Cabello's analysis on YouTube. They/She feels as if this song is talking about a narrator who is always ordered to kill targets. The narrator feels shameful and guilty, but is not strong enough to resist the coercion. During the song, the narrator feels extremely resentful of all the coercion done to him (a plague on both your houses). He struggles to control his tears and tries not to be lost in his emotions (floating around). This time after the breakdown and dilmma, he becomes determined to take vengeance on the repressor, which is why the ending sounds stronger than that of The Draw and Sleepsong.

Coincidentally, this plot is similar to Romeo's perspective. He is frustrated with the family affairs and feels that it is only "a plague on both your houses". Why "your", not "our"? Perhaps he refuses to acknowledge that he is in one of the struggles, and he hopes to end the wars instead of joining a side.


>Hey now
What's the gravity upon your face
So I'm the one who's bleeding

The "so" is the tricky part here. Gravity upon face means guilt and is the reference to Mercutio’s pun in R+J, “Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man,” playing on the two meanings of grave (dead and serious). (Genius) The one coercing the narrator to kill perhaps also feels guilt and fears death, SO they decide to use the narrator as the WEAPON, leaving the narrator to bleed in cold blood (Yeah not really good usage, but this just reminds me of Bad Blood and Four Walls). The use of gravity is also similar to the use of weight in Weight of Living.


Reference and linkage to other songs: Bad Blood, Weight of Living Pt.1, In Cold Blood of Four Walls, The Draw, Sleepsong

Linkage to OPH songs: Weapon (Your voice is a weapon, so do it with what you can, empowering ones voice and actions), Axe To Grind (denouncing the hatred of the oppressor to the opposing family) </TEXT>

>Time skips, balloon hits, I'm losing my mind
Tuesday'll be doom day, this got out of hand

After so many things that had happened, political and environmental, it seems that time is running short for us (Final Hour) and time seems to be shortening. Balloon is a metaphor for self-improvement, like taking flight from all the negative thoughts on the ground. Balloon hits could refer to self-improvement hitting on the narrator, leaving them feeling shocked and frustrated. Would it be impossible to improve, since it feels so difficult? Or balloon hits could be referring to balloons being hit and plummeting to the ground. Failure after so many times of trial. These feeling make the narrator lose their mind.

Like Genius said, Tuesday could be referring to American election dates. Like Super Tuesday. The narrator feels pessimistic, that people would not elect the best candidate in the future (WILL BE). This Got Out of Hand basically is where the extended album name came from.


>In a blanket of smoke as we sink through the floor

Like Genius said, blanket of smoke could be the cigarettes used, and sinking through the floor is the exhaustion from all the substances used. This is their way of escapism from reality. Perhaps blanket of smoke is also the reality of the situation, that they feel overwhelmed and sink through the floor. Then they would seek solace from the familia.

>familia

Why familia, not the one with the "r"? Meaning "the family" in Spanish, la familia variously refers in English to one's family, circle of friends and coworkers, teammates, or other close communities. With this Spanish meaning and the close English word "familiar", this acts as a double meaning.


>(A walking disaster)
You are my familia, you are my familia, ah-ah
(Not much, but all I would ask for)

Why would the narrator seek help from a walking disaster? Perhaps they feel truly lonely and don't mind drinking poison (bad metaphor used by me here). The narrator could not find someone better to seek help from, so they end up finding their familia. The use of "all" could hint that the narrator feels that they do not deserve help. Yeah, someone worse than me would be good, I do not deserve good help anyway. They are all I would ask for, not someone better and not a walking disaster. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do not like the fucks and pathetics, but I support the message. I understand that it is very frustrating, but I do not think it is appropriate to use fucks in people who are still fragile. It might just produce the opposite effect, like "yeah I am pathetic. I will never improve. I do not feel that taking action to improve would actually improve myself and solve problems." Which is absolutely problematic although it might seem plausible at first glance. Emotional reasoning. Future predicting. Dealing with absolutes. Denying activation paradox.

One thing I feel the need to emphasize is that people here are still not accepting of themselves. When they deny their flaws or make it affect their self esteem, it is not helpful to just tell these advice. First, accept yourself. Then call on your bullshits. Then improve. But improve, but do not just stay in your comfort zone.

Really, you can do it. You are not fucking pathetic. It is normal to have flaws, but it is also important to acknowledge them and improve accordingly. You can improve if you are willing to. The path would not be smooth or short or straightforward, and there would be off-days where it seems that you are failing again. But you WILL improve if you have the motivation and take action.  Especially when you joined an improving sub at the first place, which shows that you are motivated, and I appreciate that. Accepting yourself would be the hardest stage that you could hardly do it on your own. (The "self-help myth" mentioned by Mark Manson). But you can still do it. I believe in you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> If Hong Kong were to achieve independence, I doubt that it would be peaceful, and the success of independence might rely on foreign forces. I also doubt that Hong Kong would be intact. But at the end Hong Kong may grow weak after the battles and ends up signing a treaty, returning to China again.  Here are some of the battles and revolts I could think of:

1. Battles of Tai Po: This is the major warfront and is the most intense war. Hong Kong decides to defend its major industrial centre and revolution-supportive population fiercely. Hong Kong succeeds with major loss.

2. Battles of Plover Cove: This warfront is related to the Tai Po warfront and the critical reservoir. Hong Kong succeeds without difficulty due to the natural barriers (cliffs).

3. Battle of Shek Kong: Due to immense population, Hong Kong attempts to gain the Yuen Long Plains by sneak attacking Shek Kong Airport. Hong Kong loses overwhelmingly.

4. Battle of Tai Lam Chung: China attempts to exhaust Hong Kong by gaining Tai Lam Chung Reservoir. It was a draw and the boundary was set along Tai Tong Sweet Gum Woods,  Tuen Mun-Sam Shing and Ha Sha Chau.

5. Battles of Cheung Tsui Chau. China invades Sai Kung to control the entrance of Mirs Bay. The battle is not significant, ending up with a draw and a treaty setting the whole of Mirs Bay as international waters.

6. Riots in Tsuen Wan, Wan Chai and North Point.

Protective areas issued by UN: Mai Po, Tai Po Kau, The Brothers Marine Park, Sha Chau and Lung Kwu Chau Marine Park, Kadoorie Farm, all areas within Global Geopark. Any side who contaminate the lands would not be recognized as a member of the UN.


Of course, no serious consideration is done in the above information. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think it really depends on where you come from. Bastille's fame is mostly centered in Western Europe and the US. Perhaps they are also well known in some more countries like Australia. But outside of these areas, Bastille is not well-known at all. As a HKer / Chinese, I did not know of Pompeii at all until I wandered on YouTube for days and weeks. I have heard of Happier being played in shops here, but I would not count it as a Bastille song. Especially when people rarely remember Daya in Don't Let Me Down by Chainsmokers (not the best example, but I know nothing of Marshmellow simply because I am not interested at all). Pompeii in shops? Nearly impossible.

Anyway, I don't think they are that underground either. I was surprised when I saw QPM trending internationally on Youtube, but this shows that they still have large solid base that they could make it to the trending songs. And I like the state of Bastille. They could easily make a decent amount of money, but they would not be too stressed on making perfect music. I think the not-too-large Stormers community makes me feel that each Stormer is deeply connected with one another, which I have not experienced before.

I really think they deserve better, since they are so poetic and brilliant, but I think this popularity would be the most comfortable one for both Stormers and Bastille, especially that Dan is still a bit easily anxious and stressed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I interpret it like this :

So the narrator was in a mental crisis, and could not comprehend what was going on. They (gender neutral) feel the Draw, that their friends might be just faking it and are untrustworthy, so that they couldn't tell somebody what was going on in their brain. But when they finally overcame the Draw, they realize how important social support was, and thank the helper through the song.

>Let the parties end when we lose our friends
'Cause you cut through all the noise
Let the years roll on 'till the static comes
'Cause you cut through all the noise

Party. Reminds me of Doom Days, particularly Another Place and 4AM. Doom Days might be a continuation on this. So why would we lose our friends after parties? Perhaps the narrator feel that people would leave them after meeting someone new at the party. So this emphasizes that the narrator feels secure and confident in the relationship (friend, romantic, whatever) that the saver would not leave them. And then party could refer to our lives. It is a chaotic party full of noise. Parties end is death. Why would the narrator uses party, something so positive? Perhaps the saviour(anchor) has helped the narrator to view that life is not that awful, and is just a party. Everyone gets drunk(headspin), there are a lot of accidents  But it is still enjoyable (happiness). (Why would I think of Lethargy here ahhhh). How "let" is used indicates that the narrator is not afraid of death because the saviour is with the narrator. Static. Like Genius said, static can refer to death, so that the meaning would be similar to the previous lyric. I think there is something underlying this metaphor, but I could not know exactly what it is.

As mentioned, this song might be a reference to Weight of Living Pt.1 and the Rime of the Ancient Mariner. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think the lyric is related to Weight of Living Pt.1 "Oh...There's a light. " So in Rime of the Ancient Mariner, there is a lighthouse (both ocean-related) towards the end of the story.

"This seraph-band, each waved his hand:

It was a heavenly sight!

They stood as *signals to the land*,

Each one a lovely light;

This seraph-band, each waved his hand,

No voice did they impart—

No voice; but oh! the silence sank

Like music on my heart."

So the light, as in Anchor, gives the narrator hope and direction, possibly by blinding away the negative emotions and what is happening in their brain or the outside world. So it is purpose and escapism. It could also refer to how strong that hope (light) being given is, that it could shine brightly to the far corners of the sea (narrator's brain) and blinds away the negative thoughts.

"Music on my heart", on the other hand, might be related to "the song I sing again and again", like it gives the narrator direction and covers the raucous chaos of the world.

<TEXT> I agree to some extent that people are fetishizing life struggles. Really, they would think it is inspiring for people who are struggling, but it isn't and it seems to be more invalidating than being supportive.

But I would say that struggles force us to grow in a harsh and unbearable way. For example, having no parents or supportive figures might make you grow more independently and know how to be alone. I should say that I grew up in an overprotective household, and I had to look up the Internet for skills such as making instant noodles. Sure, immense struggle only provides you with a difficult situation and does not limit a person's reactions. But I think at least it might make a person learn new life skills earlier, if not quicker and more efficiently. And learning and mastering these skills earlier can be interpreted as being stronger than your peers.

>People attribute it to the strength I gained in childhood having lost both my parents.

I personally interpret this as people are sympathizing your situation and admiring that you can do so well despite your flawed childhood. But this is of course not every case, and the fetishization of struggles can also be a factor. Uh I am an awful conversation continuer.

In addition, I think people who are struggling or have been struggling tend to be unable to see how their struggles improve them, since their negative emotions towards the experience are affecting how they see the experience as a whole. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So below is just a random bunch of information unorganized and may not be reliable in some points.

Basically it relieves your stress and is not really problematic if you are not addicted to it (like if you want to masturbate all day long that it affects your schedule and you would avoid activities to masturbate). It can improve your self image if done correctly. Some studies show that it also lowers the chance of getting prostate cancer in middle age if you are in your 50s, but it increases the chance of getting prostate cancer in middle age if you are in your 20s-30s, even if these are just theories and need more research. Masturbation may result in weight loss. (But this is not proven to be a healthy way to get rid of fat) Incorrect positions may cause erectile problems, if I remember correctly.

Masturbating frequently might be a common trait in adolescent ages due to the hormones present. I remember seeing a survey that 80% of male respondents said that they had masturbated before. But if you feel that masturbation is starting to affect your life, this might be a symptom of excess stress (hypersexuality is another mental issue relating to masturbation, but it is a very extreme case that would require medical diagnosis and treatment). Simply suppressing masturbation urges might be unhealthy, or at least not alleviating the problem. Methods of reducing stress would be better than to suppressing the urges.

NoFap brings benefits according to some participants because it relates to goal setting. They may also be improving in other areas so it seems that NoFap is helping them. Relapses would be very depressing and problematic if they are not handled properly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> A BIT LONG ANALYSIS

This song has rather straightforward lyrics. "Will you be my future or just an escape? Love me, love me, love me." would be the best lyric to conclude the whole song. The narrator meets someone during the orgy and falls in love with them (gender neutral, him/her/their). However as the night passes and the morning comes, everyone falls asleep, and their fear for the future overwhelms them. They become lonely again.

>I can feel your eyes in the back of my head
Burning, burning, burning
Floating through the room as the hairs on my arms are
Rising, rising, rising

The burning may refer to the burning passion. Floating through the room means that the narrator feels lost  confused and out of purpose, which is why a surreal feel is adopted throughout the song. Rising hairs on arm is a symptom of feeling an intense emotion. It could be fear, confusion, pessimism or most likely, love and affection.

>Pulling at my t-shirt, your hands everywhere
Rising, rising, rising
As you trip and fall, dragging me up the stairs
What's your, what's your name, now?

Pulling at clothing and hands everywhere would be a scene likely done by a blind or disabled person trying to achieve balance or know the direction to walk. This signifies that the narrator's new lover feels lost, likely by the impacts of the apocalypse. Stairs is a metaphor for challenges the narrator faces, and the lover attempts to help the narrator clumsily even when they are not in a much better situation. However the narrator still does not know basic information such as the name of the lover, making it more reasonable for the narrator to feel as if they are just an escape and would not be a permanent SO.

>You try to get to heaven on a night like this
But you, you never get to heaven on a night like this

In Genius, it says that this is a Glory reference and is about religion. Partly, I guess. The narrator or people in general usually try to reach religion for help. But they have lost hope in their future at the moment, that they could not motivate themselves to be religious. Not to mention religions usually prohibit lust,  especially these orgies. At the end they are alone (or are they?) The "heaven" could also refer to a bliss, intense happiness and content. They try to fully lose themselves into the orgy and the fun, but they are still reminded of the tragedies play out in their lives and could not fully escape. This may be that they feel the need to contribute to the solution of the apocalypse instead of escaping. Their guilt stops them from reaching heaven.
(Btw Looking up=anticipating, get to=participating at the moment)

The repetition of phrases "you, you" might be due to the confusion state of the participants and the narrator, that they are stuttering because they could mot comprehend what is going on.

>The lights, the lights, the lights
They cut a path across the room
The lights, the lights, the lights
A blinding look from me to you
And I'll be your rabbit in the headlights
We'll never get to heaven
I'll be your rabbit in the headlights
We'll never get to heaven

The lights, similar to Weight of Living Pt.1, is referring to hope. The narrator feels of tingle of hope during their encounter with their lover. It is also a dramatic scene of them meeting each other. But they feel as if they could not just reach content, as they do not know each other well. The religious meaning would be that faith would not help them, so they would embrace each other as hard as possible. Rabbit in the headlights refer to being surprised, as the narrator feels that it is impossible for meeting a lover during such a crisis. This also explains why he feels the relationship would be unsustainable.

Then come the instruments, building a surreal atmosphere and brings out the confusion in the narrator's head.

For the music video, I wish to bring attention to the details. The first discovery of mine is the magazine depicting a bomb explosion. This brings out the apocalyptic background, which is why they are all here. Perhaps it is related to the nuclear threat of N.Korea, Iran, US, or the war threat between countries such as US and China. Then come the tattos. Some of the tattoos include a speech bubble below an eye (hidden emotions), a teardrop below the eye (depression, sleepsong), three dots forming an equilateral triangle, possibly a reference to Bastille song and also to the mathematical symbol "Therefore". These depict the struggles (apocalypse)of each person coming to the orgy. For example the therefore sign represents that the person perhaps feel that there is simply no logic in the world. Towards the end of the video, all the people raise their hands, creating a creepy sceen that they are drowning together (in their apocalypse and emotions) and a surreal atmosphere. The alternating lights also bring out the confusion of the participants. </TEXT>

My personal favourites that I consider them as the best:
1. Weight of Living Pt.1 (poetic references, metaphors, theme)

2. Laughter Lines (beautiful, symbolizations, my potential funeral song)

3. Lethargy (theme, double meaning in lyrics)

<TEXT> CAUTION LONG ANALYSIS

I love how this song discussion forces me to rethink and intercept the meaning behind Bastille songs that I have long ignored. I have just figured out some details in some Doom Days songs. This is my another attempt on intercepting the song. Unlike Torn Apart Pt.1, I could not understand every words and sentences in this instant. This comment also features my interceptions on WWCOMMS, since this song is the most important intro of wwcomms.

I really encourage you to scroll through the comment section of the YouTube video. Unlike many other artists', Bastille's comment section can sometimes be a gold mine. Genius is also sometimes a good source for understanding the song, even though detailed interpretation might be limited to the mainstream songs of Bastille. There would be others attempting to explain the song, but the content is repeated to the above ones.

This Bastille song, again, features three themes. The surface view would be talking about relationships, how a couple hides their flaws and emotions. Then this song might be related to Torn Apart. The middle view would be focusing on faking it, how we all try to fake ourselves, to hide our hideous truths and emotions, then appear to be confident. From individuals impressing others, couples in relationships, to even politicians and world leaders. This layer is mainly the connection, and is not elaborated. Finally it is connected to the hidden layer, which the video tries to explain, maybe. The WWCOMMS explanation, perhaps. The hypocrisy of absolute authoritarianism rule or populism. (WTF, I KNOW. ARRRRR HEADACHE)

People are mainly interpreting the first layer, so I would conclude it beiefly and speak of some of the confusing parts. So the song is about a couple who have gone through a horrible mistake (crimes in relationship). A likely one would be cheating, but who knows? It might be someone being overprotective (when you're being stopped at every turn). This song is narrated from the view of the cheater (or mistake doer). They(gender neutral) realize that they had done something horrible and unforgivable, but they still love their SO and attempt to convince their partner to "fake it", that nothing was wrong and they could just "turn a blind eye" to the mistakes. They first praise the SO. Flower through disarray(Give hope in times of chaos). Wax to jokes. Lost and found(always reconciled after arguments, might be related to Divide). Knocking heads (arguments) laying low (hidden). Rip the page of their mistakes off. Stop the "days and nights lost in weakness (their mistakes and flaws).

The middle layer is simply the connection, but what I am interested in is the connection between Fake It and Send Them Off (The person in the TV is from Fake It). Not only do couples fake it and hide, normal person also suppress their unwanted emotions (eg jealousy) even if they are seemingly brilliant (most brilliant mind the world has ever seen).  The suppressed feelings soon become unbearable. In addition, the video focuses on how politicians and the media delivers are struggling to fake it. They have to appear calm, even if they are frustrated, angry, terrified, etc.

Then come the crazy part, which is a bit unbelievable that it might be nonsense. I know wwcomms is something bad, but really? Perhaps the WWCOMMS reflects the reality and possibility of the situation. Russia, China, to populism in UK and US.

The sentence I began to think in this direction is "Lost and found, knocking heads, laying low" Lost and found. Guess what? You spoke something wrong, was kidnapped, then was brainwashed and released. Knocking heads (Merrian Webster: to use angry or forceful methods to control or punish people) Manipulation in relationships, or totalitarianism? Laying low; hidden from public view.

Then come to comment about the symbol looking like Valknut from Norse. The symbol, like many others associated with Germanic paganism, has been appropriated by some white supremacists groups to represent their heritage. Oh my. Trump? Paganism can be referred to personality cult. Hitler, fascism, USSR, totalitarianism?

With this angle, the song becomes immediately different. It becomes the government trying to appease its citizens (my lover) and convice them to ignore all the ugly details and continue to live under a facade (fake it). Destroy the historical documents (ripe the page off). Turn a blind eye. (NOOOOOO). Does the citizens have the capacity of allowing all of these seemingly selfish wants to continue? Or does it have to be forcely developed by others?

German paganism. Religion. The cult in Blame. The eerie church in Send Them Off. All controlled by WWCOMMS. The symbolization of the power of the god to bind and unbind become the power of the government. No wonder the whole theme of Wild World is about religion and politics mainly. (Yes, even Glory, which would be explained in another time)

Disregarding all the craziness, I love how the subtitles in the screen of Fake It have a lot of different languages, mostly talking about the situations and criticisms of hypocrisy. The translations can be found in the Youtube comments, and it is hard to cover them all.  I would provide some Chinese translations though. In 00:37, the sentences are 當風向轉變時(When the direction of the wind changes. A common metaphor for the transfer of power or a change in popular culture or political belief)，有人築牆(Some are building walls. Perhaps helping and allowing the government to segregate others? Different views(Berlin Wall), Different people (Mexican Border)，有人放風箏(Some are flying kites. Perhaps escapism through entertainment? But would it lead to an Icarus-like tragic end?) 。欲蓋彌彰(Covering mistakes but ended up making things even worse by exposing them further). The flying kite one reminds me of the ending of Nocturnal Creatures. A quote commenting on the collapse of USSR(Changing direction of the wind?). "We received the freedom but we were completely unaware what to do with this freedom. It felt like the hungry people received the foods and we just ate everything."

OH NO THIS GOT OUT OF HAND. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Part II analysis: (unreliable?)

Yin and yang are two contrary forces that are chaotic then they are apart but together they form peace(synergy). So by referencing yin and yang she means that her and her lover cannot be apart. (Genius)

So this narrator believes that she/they and her SO are meant to be together at first. The narrator might had met her SO in a red-light district (you gonna remember when I shake my ass), highlighting how vulnerable the relationship is as ot bases on beauty and sex? This also might be a reference to OPH 2 Free (Private Dancer). However, she grows dissatisfied with SO's treatment on her. (I’ve been getting this shit for a long time). She becomes pessimistic that she thinks satisfaction from love only brings heartache? She then is naughty because she indulges herself into sex? She might have a love-hate relationship with her SO, that she convinces herself that SO isn't important (second fiddle) in her love relationship and she criticizes SO for being too mean. But at the end she still loves SO as she remembers the days where she had synergy with SO, and tries to remedy the relationship. This internal conflict tears narrator apart.

Part II makes less sense than the video for me now. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yay time to talk about the most peculiar Bastille video ever. Which I have just figured it out with flaws being understood.

So the video describes a couple hiding their flaws from each other (Hence the Flaws video turned to an artwork). Perhaps originally they were fine, but they tried to change once an argument occured. They actively morphed themselves to suit the other's tastes (eg Three penises), but repeatedly failed and changed again and again (Hence the morph of looks, and the disappointed expressions). Since they only loved an imaginary version of their partner, only loving perfection and not embracing both of their flaws, they were meant to be torn apart. For remedial, they indulged themselves into sex and lust, which was only a temporary solution. Finally they broke up. But they were "out of sight but not out of their minds", so they tried to come together again, repeating the same cycle. It felt as if they were being thrown around and it hurts like hell.


Time for the wisdom nonsense.

"Love is like mushrooms. If you shoot a duck I am scared of toast."

They are meant to be confusing and unrelated while contributing to the theme. Love is a confusing topic. It is mushrooms, a fungi, while we are humans. Fungi isn't even plants, it is a separate species of organisms. "If you shoot a duck" refers to a person criticising their SO on something trivial, something nonsense. "I am scared of toasts" refers to the SO misunderstanding and overthinking that they think something else unrelated is the reason of the argument. For example, you criticized me of not tidying up after breakfast (shooting a duck) because you did not sleep well, but I thought I was doing something unforgivable and think you were starting to hate me, that our relationship was worsening, so I was scared of talking to you (toast), which is something unrelated to the problem.


"Love is a port-a-potty filled with hope and happiness."

Port-a-potty, for non-native speakers like me, is a portable toilet. We fill it in with what is unnecessary (excretion) and even dispicable (faeces). Love, on the other hand, is filled with accidents and arguments. We accidentally rant and take our dispicable anger out on our SO. But love is still a beautiful thing and is filled with hope and happiness. So this is obviously a simile. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Interesting. It reminds me of the district council systen in Hong Kong. Could you enlighten me on how the new system prevents the parties only give one representative per small districts? In HK district council, each party would only send one representative to the election of each small district. In a worse case, individual candidates would discuss whether to be a candidate of a district, or to select one from a party of similar ideology. (Eg Young Independent Politician and Democratic Party Politician) This gradually changes to voting party ideology rather than individuality.
Nevertheless, on the whole this system encourages voting individuals rather than parties when compared with two party system in the US. </TEXT>

<TEXT> From the Internet, liberalism encourages an amount of control on the market, while libertarianism seeks to remove any control on the market. You can say libertarianism is more pro-capitalist than liberalism. For example, liberalism might encourage a higher minimum wage, while libertarianism encourages a lower or even no minimum wage. Very low taxes are received under libertarianism, while a medium amount of taxes are received under liberalism. Very high taxes are received under socialism. No health care for libertarianism. Some health care for liberalism. A lot of health care for socialism. This is what I get as a non-American. I have no idea on the differences of human rights policies though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To all the people using "disgusting" as an argument of opposing zoophiles, it is true that this is disgusting. However it would not be a strong argument if you were to argue whether zoophile was GRSM or not. This is because homophobes are using the similar hate to prosecute us.

When asked if homosexuality is accepted, why zoophiles isn't, you should instead say:

1. Animals do not have consent, or are too naive to have consent on having sex with humans. Zoophile is rape. This is exactly why pedophiles are not accepted as well.

2. Having sex with animals is dangerous. Humans are a known species. We have similar sets of sexual organs as well as similar sexual diseases. When it comes to risks of sexual diseases, it can be easily reduced with technological and scientific improvements. However we still do not know much on sexual diseases of animals. Zoophiles might actually cause a pandemic if human-to-animal or animal-to-human diseases are caused. And it would be less likely to know sexual diseases of all animals thoroughly than compared to humans.

3. Zoophiles are unnatural. There are few known sexual attraction among different species, because failure of offspring is likely, crossing sexual diseases is likely, and it would not be beneficial to species survival. Homosexuality exists to take care of abandoned offsprings, since straights are busy reproducing. One known sexual attraction among cross species is flamingos having crushes on humans. Nevertheless no sex occured as it was dangerous.(See 2) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Perhaps, but not likely. Slightly pink quartz is usually caused by either one of two reasons. It is usually feldspar content in the quartz. It could also be oxidized iron (iron ii,iii oxides or iron iii oxide). In less typical cases, it could be due to manganese content, or some other substances. Rose quartz is pink due to dumotierite.

<TEXT> Concerning the rock, I have done a streak test on a paper and it did leave a bit pale green streak. I am too lazy to find some sandpaper so I attempted to scratch off the [malachite/jadeite]. I eventually scratched a tiny bit of it off, so I initially believe that the green substance would possibly be something not very hard, or some clay or paint sticked to it. I would carry out the nail test soon, and I am inclined to expect malachite, but who knows?

Thank you very much. I really aspire to do something related to geology. Gelology is the first subject which I would swoon while reading new information about it, aside from reading and music. I actually decided to study Biology and Chemistry so that I can study something a bit related to Geology, except Physics which I suck at. Nevertheless I am concerned that my personality and physical abilities would hinder me from field work. I might stick to a (Geography) teacher. Geologist is a broad area that includes a lot of subtopics and indoor and outdoor jobs. However I do not think there would be a lot of choices here, except for a teacher, a geological tour guide at the Global Geopark, or something related to hydrology. Field surveyors, urban planners and forest surveyors might be close, but they are more related to human geography and biology. Well I still have time to plan and dream, I guess.

Sorry to bother you further, but would you mind checking my other requests as well? They are at my rarely-active post section, and some would be repeated. Some of them might be more blurry than others, and most would have a short description as they are observed only at the fields. I was also still beginning to explore, so other observations such as cleavage might not be included. It is definitely okay to be not free to respond, of course. Thank you again for your detailed answer. I really enjoy having rare detailed description. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Dan uses double meanings in the music video. A fire can refer to burning flames. It can refer to a cross-fire of guns (of words-arguments). And it is used as a metaphor here for destruction of relationship. And in addition, it can be burning passion gone out of control. A fire can be useful, for such can be used to set boundaries. But the fire had gine out of control, and they could just sit and all they had burned on the pyre. Finally, it could be a reference to Pompeii, where ash (memories) covered the city (relationship), with fire (arguments) burning all around on the highly flammable lava(accidents and misunderstandings).

I remember that this was my third Bastille song, the one that made me stay. Pompeii was how I knew Bastille, World Gone Mad was how I rediscovered Bastille, and Things We Lost in the Fire was the one that made me stay, and the only one that all my family love. Well, people kept saying that Glory has the most normal MV, but perhaps it is TWLitF that has the most normal one. Or does it goes to Torn Apart? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a gay man, I am aware of all these issues in our community. However, I believe it is not our community that is responsible. Instead, it is the interpretation of GRSM community internalizing into us. Let me take extreme sexualization as an example. When I see GRSM representation in the media (Romantic sexual minorities in particular, since gender minorities' representation is disappointingly little), I see tons of kissing and having sex with no control. I do not see them having normal lives or being a hero. Instead, their GRSM representation becomes the full description of their identity.  This is a problem among representation of these sexual traits. If it is just a 'I am gay,'  it can be easily deleted fron the film upon release on homophobic countries. When movies and books fetishize GRSM, we sexualize ourselves too.

Toxicity is a value taught on us. We mimic toxicity from others, and GRSM has the same ability to mimic others as cis people. However, due to lack of education on GRSM issues, extreme body shaming and stereotypes (Bisexual erasure) becomes an issue among us. Since we are more vulnerable to these problems, it seems that we are more toxic than others.

Other possible reasons why you think most GRSM is toxic include 1. You have met not enough GRSM (unconvincing, I know) 2. Negative Bias (We tend to remember more negative memories and experiences than positive ones, because they have a more power effect)

Of course, we cannot put all the blame on others. We should also actively improve our community. It would be a long journey, but there will be a point where GRSM is finally treated in the same position as cis. </TEXT>

<TEXT> >In my left hand there is the familiar
In my right hand there's the great unknown
I can see the madly different grass there
But I'm drawn to wilder nights at home

Stormers, what are your thoughts on these lines?

I believe that the familiar is our friends and families, as mentioned in 4AM. The great unknown is the challenges we face in the future and possibly mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. But the two later lines are more confusing. Perhaps the madly different grass is a metaphor for emotions and growth? That the left hand side is a beautiful scenery of a lawn? And the right hand side is a ugly, wilted, twisted and entangled grassland? If it is true, then this metaphor is a genius usage for the draw. Grass can grow in different ways, and they can be as beautiful and as terrible as we can imagine.

Is the wilder nights at home related to escapism (DD?)? That we try to escape the draw of the sides by drinking, partying at home by ourselves?

Suddenly, I realize that perhaps songs in ATBB are connected. Of the Night refers to the struggles of a person. How they see the darker sides of the world. The Draw is them internalizing the darkness of the world into their own, and desperately trying to escape. What Would You Do is a person trying to have "wilder nights" and escape. Perhaps they work as a "private dancer" or as a spectator. That is why the draw and WWYD seems to be linking to each other in terms of instrumental arrangement.

I really love the escalation of instrumental use in The Draw. It really captures how powerful the draw can be. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I remember when I first heard the song, I did not like the sound of it. But as time past, it stuck into my brain, and I found it more and more relatable. The song is simply too catchy. This is my first Bastille experience of a song growing on me till I am addicted to it. But I have to admit that the music video creep me out. I love how the video really adds to the intentionally disturbing lyrics on rituals, jealousy and darkness of our minds . I think it is more unsettling than the Pompeii video, but as a weird person, I also find it satisfying and enjoyable. Weird videos are the best, and this isn't even the most bizzare Bastille video.

This song is a classic example of Bastille music with literature references. I love Dan for these references, and I starve for more. I couldn't wait to read Othello.


Song discussion time.

>It was a slight on my honor, so he deserved it
But we're talking about the most brilliant mind this world's ever seen

What do you think is the purpose of adding this clip? I interpret the second sentence as that brilliant minds have a darker side hidden from the view of the public, but I could not get the message of the first sentence. Regardless, it is a brilliant intro to the song. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have just noticed that Dan went back to the crime scene on the beach in the music video. (Ahhhh the YouTube design) Do you think he lied down because he began to accept his flaws and could truly die? Or do you think he lied down because he still couldn't accept his flaws (such as, presumably, his flaws in his relationship with the Bad Blood girl?), so he could not fully enjoy his experiences in the theme park and lie on the beach as it is the place closest to the Bad Blood girl?

<TEXT> Microaggressions are definitely an issue when it comes to human rights movements. I often encounter microaggressional homophobia and transphobia. Maybe I rarely encounter misogyny because I live in Hong Kong, where women are nearly having equal status with men compared to many other places. Of course it is far from perfect, but when I see S. Korea, Japan and other Asian countries, I am a bit proud of our progress.

Your feminazis description immediately reminds me of a time when I see a misogyny comment on r/HongKong. Being accused of too radical definitely is an issue in all human rights activism. It really makes me stuck in a dilemma sometimes. Am I being too sensitive? Or am I doing the right thing?

Sadly there is still so much hate going around in the modern world. With women weighting about 40% of our human population and still getting hate, it seems an impossible goal for all minorities to get rights as well. There is a long road ahead, both on Reddit improvement and on the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I upvoted you because you are a rare person being civil in this topic, and I appreciate and value your civility more than your opinion. Even we have oppositing opinions, we could still discuss civilly. This is what democracy is about, and some fail to understand that.

As a Hong Konger, I disagree that 2014 831 is the biggest error. Instead, it should be 2003 launching Article 23. The event caused a massive revulsion and mistrust to CCP. Looking back, I am now indeed a bit in a dilemma on whether to support 2014 831 or not. The functional constituenicies part was appealing, but the biggest drawback was the unchanged 1200 Election Committee. The massive education sector and the tiny agriculture and fisheries sector had the same amount of votes. The proposal indeed could bring a degree of democracy, but with a mistrustful view, without a democratically elected Chief Executive, CCP might still be able to use other methods (eg Interpretation of law) to damage the democratic state of HK. Also, Chief Executive could still propose policies, appoint judges, etc. It is not very correct to say CE is just a figure head, although from a systematic perspective, the power of CE is indeed being limited.

But I agree that the Democratic Legislators are sometimes knee-jerking. Sometimes I have pessimistic thoughts that Hong Kong would not be well-off even when being a full democracy.

On a side note, I am interested on what mistakes Britain made on Hong Kong in WWII. Could you elaborate more on that? </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. Hong Kongers (Or Chinese HKers that time) had been hoping China to be democratic since the very beginning. People were supporting the transfer of power BECAUSE they  had no hope in British HK being democratic (for obvious reasons, despite multiple attempts in being a bit more democratic) and they were hoping China to be more democratic on handling Hong Kong. Opinions drastically changed when former Chief Executive put foward Article 23(Internet Control) right after SARS. But opinions changed even more dramatically during 2014 Occupy Central and 2019 Protests. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When WHO praised the Hong Kong government that it has done a great job in containing the pandemic, I bet almost every HKer rolled their eyes. It is true that HK had low cases (Last time I checked is around 640, for an international financial center), but the appraise should be for HKers' high hygiene conciousness, not the government. Chief Executive Carrie Lam refused to completely close the border between the Mainland and HK, causing an influx of Chinese cases in February. She selected sites for isolation camps and appointed clinics for COVID-19 without any public consultation. Some are said to be too close to settlements. An appointed clinc was at a 10m-proximity to the nearest settlement. She once pressured officials not to wear face masks unless they are front-line workers, and did not wear a mask during a patrol.

On the other hand, some Hong Kongers wore face masks everywhere as early as early January, possibly due to the lesson of SARS. Almost everyone wore face masks by early February. Everyone treated the nearest person as an infected patient.

If WHO has to praise, it should praise Macau's work. Last time I checked, there were only 37 cases in Macau. Macau closed all casinos earlier to prevent influx of Chinese cases. The policy was lifted temporarily due to too few cases.It had also declared the closure of classes very early. I am very amazed by Macau's performance, and was a bit disappointed on HKGoV.  Taiwan also deserved approval, for its low infection rate despite massive population.

I was not surprised but not infuriated by sources claiming that Tedros was close to China. Despite supporting protesters, it is almost inevitable for a person to be close with either China or USA. It would be hypocritical to accuse Tedros but not accuse USA-friendly officials. But I had to say that I had become more and more disappointed by his job on both handling the pandemic and politics. </TEXT>

Cath chirped merrily as she gobbled down some rose-red rowan berries. Oh dear, she had not been so content for quite a while. Her ex Jimmy always criticised her that she was too 'fat'. Well, who cares about what she looked like after decisively getting divorced with Jimmy? She was free. Finally free. Perhaps she could get use of some social distancing. It wouldn't hurt to be single and not get a significant other, then consider finding another one. She was merried multiple time. All of them did not work, but who cares if she did not?

Rowans tasted particularly sweet that day. She embraced the lovely scent, the brush of the juicy berries on her throat. She embraced the chilly wind, bringing wonderful aura of yet another branch of berries. Spring was coming. Parakeet- green leaves were spranging up all round the lovely woods. The scene was lovely, and so was her serene soul. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay. If you are genuinely interested in asking, I suggest going to r/changemyview . Unfortunately, I have observed that people in major subreddits such as r/politics, r/tumblr, r/AskReddit and other subs do not really favour having a serious conversation without some personal attacks, a bunch of downvotes, etc. Well, it is true that your thoughts should be seen as morally wrong, so having downvotes should be expected.

I agree that simply blocking a conversation is not the best way of educating people. This is indeed problematic, especially when a teacher or governor does it. I am now trying to outline some ideas why slavery is a bad thing. Firstly, the obvious point, slavery hurts citizens of a society.  A slave is stripped of any rights, freedom and individuality. Which means that employers could starve you, tease you, tortures you if they like. Imagine you are a slave. You are forced to work for long hours, occasionally being beaten, watching others work to death. You would not have any doubt and sympathy for slavery.

Secondly, in terms of economic aspect, like you do when writing the previous comments, slavery is definitely not a sustainable way of development. (Of course, it is again morally controversial to talk about a topic like this in terms of economy) Biologically, people would demand freedom and resist oppression. A person beating up yourself might resemble a predator weakening a prey. And even if our biological instincts have faded away, we are still a species rapidly demanding improvement. When we reach a stage where we are all economically stable, we would demand something further, such as freedom and rights. With the theories above, oppressing others is not a sustainable way of development. If there would be a day, any day possible, that all the workers would go on strike, kill slave users, it is not beneficial to use the system for a long term. Even if slavery might appear to have benefits.

Yes, and everything could provide benefits if we wish to find it, but we should also view the morality and the sustainability when adopting it. I am only briefly covering the points, and people on CMV would have better answers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really hope there are more news without coronavirus mentioned in it. It literally blinds out all other major events happening. Like I knew nothing about the earthquake in Croatia, or the updates on the locusts in Africa and Asia, except when I dived into Tumblr and Reddit. [Potential unpopular opinion] It really does not help for the world to emphasize how serious the coronavirus is becoming, when there are the ones that are already doing their best to maintain hygiene (just look at HK here), and there are the ones who raise a middle finger to hygiene no matter what, and finally there are the ones who could not maintain hygiene (eg people in crazy schools and companies being forced to take off their masks, work at offices, have regular large dining events....)

I hate that it becomes a casual topic (like 721 or 831 earlier here), that I simply could not prevent myself from absorbing more and more information until I collapse. The worst thing is having a mental condition in the meantime, like I do.

Aside from coronavirus being an important news, another reason why people only talk about this pandemic is yhe effect of negative bias. We might unconsciously remember and pay attention to negative info rather than wholesome ones. We can change this by changing our mindsets bit by bit (IF we can, of course). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Unfortunately, Redditors typically agree with the ACAB statement. Well, it is true that some (or many) cops are turning corrupt, overly violent, or racist, homophobic and transphobic. Hell, I live in Hong Kong, so I know how excessively violent some can be. But we still need to acknowledge more the existance of good officers in the community. No matter we like it or not, we still need some kind of a police force for maintaining order and solving crimes such as murder or theft. And even it is hard to admit, police is some of the most vulnerable groups to commiting crimes and suicide, as they witnessed the darkest side of society. If we give up on them right now and say ACAB, it turns into a SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY and the police may also give up on themselves, when the only ones who support them are white supremacists and racists. We still need to condemn police brutality, but pls also praise those who are having a good relationship with citizens and those who are actually honest and nice. Yes, and I know this is a hard to swollow pill for many Redditors, and I am ready for downvotes flooding in.

By the way, the original flag was used for memorializing DEATHS OF POLICE DURING WORK. It is bullshit that white supremacists decided to use the flag. Done. </TEXT>

"Go on. Destroy me. You may have killed me, but there are millions and billions more of me. You are destined to be outnumbered. You cannot destroy a part of music, because after destroying me, another me would be created. Then another. And another. Killing me would only provoke my creaters to recreate me again. Music cannot be blocked, and I am not sorry to tell you that music will be become a common asset among peasants in the future. You are destined to lose, and my death is only a victory for me. Go on. Kill me. Crush me." The lute replied in a peculiarly smug tone.

With his shaking hands, he plunged the sword into the lute. Why was he so afraid? It was just a lute. It seemed as if he was killing a person. Did he even hear a voice coming from the lute? He had to rest, he decided, but only if his lord allowed.

He found himself to be stammering. His eyes became blurry. Why was he forced to destroy a lovely instrument? He then murmured "I have failed my duty. I fail to block the spread of music. But I still need to do my best to appease my lord. I love you. Sorry."

<TEXT> Well, I have (or, to some extent, had) a similar problem as you do. My social worker told me to compare myself to the same person again, and see what things do I do better than them. It was ridiculous, as I thought at first, but it actually works for me. I mean, it helps me understand that everyone has different abilities, goals and speed of progress. Some may crawl slowly and steadily, perhaps only with a few stumbles. Some may run and seem to get an excellent progress that they are almost at the finish line, but then they give up and have to start again. Or they lack maintenance and everything crumbles. Perhaps, but not absolutely, you might be the first type. Perhaps, but not absolutely, they are the second type. You would not know the future. Heck, perhaps they are just trying to show their best side at you, and hide all the ugly bites and scratches beneath it. You are not a mind-reader, I assume.

Well, it is perfectly normal to feel resentful and miserable. Some just hide their hatred better so that you would not know. First, you need to tell yourself (out loud is even better) that your emotions are acceptable. For the guilt that you dare to feel resentful instead of joyful, I could see that you care deeply about your friends just because you feel guilty of feeling only resentful. It is just a feeling, and it means nothing if you do not act it out (Even if you do, it is solved if you express apology).

And finally, a simple solution here after reading all of these. Confront your negative thoughts by first identifying distortions. Some of them I detected are mind-readimg (assuming that others are all successful), future-predicting (thinking you will never succeed~ well, who knows the future anyway?). Then convince yourself by accepting your emotions (it is okay to feel) and project the reality without distortions OUT LOUD.  I think you have succeeded brilliantly in knowing that your thoughts are distortions, but saying them out loud somehow becomes much more helpful. Repeat them if necessary.

For accepting your emotions, imagine how you would comfort your friend if he/she/they has a similar problem. You would talk to them gently and figure out distortions (probably unknowingly).  You might have learnt this before.

I recommend Woebot- I learnt some of the methods here from the app. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I started about 1 year ago.

1. Much less splashing and more hygienic to the washroom. For selfish reasons, I pee standing in public washrooms because the toilet lid is sometimes intolerably dirty.

2. Laziness and tiredness

3. Actually healthier (I forgot the details)

4. Does not require aiming, in which aiming sucks because if you have an unexplainable erection...

5. Develops a skill for peeing in pitch darkness. I mean I could pee standing if there is dim light to let the pee to reflect light and let me see my aiming. But this method requires a lot of skills, and sometimes if it is midnight and I do not want to mess up my sleepiness, sitting is better. </TEXT>

The story was removed as I see that this might be seen as inappropriate. I apologise if you are feel deeply disturbed and disgusted. This sub should be a light-hearted hobby sub and I regret for my inconsiderate behaviour. I tried to end the story in a more positive note but apparently it did not work. I did not remove this comment as it serves as a reminder to me that taboo topics should be handled more carefully. You are welcome to give constructive criticism or continue to express your disapproval. I am still exploring myself and I guess I wandered into my darker corners.

<TEXT> Because this is the fucked up way your mind tells you to improve. Your brain actively creates distortions and makes you feel inferior to make you strive to do better.Sometimes  it fucks its job up and makes irrational thinking.

Imagine a friend in front of you has the same problems as you do. What and how would you say to your friend? You would try to be understanding and work out the distortions and othet better possibilities. Then say those words out loud yourself.

Eg. "I am worth of attention and being loved, because I am a human being. I might have flaws, but I am compassionate and understanding. I am good at playing computer games. Compared to my flaw, my strengths worth more attention. I should pity those who only see my flaws because they might be struggling to see their own strengths as well." </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, this rock is the same as the 'one more I find' one. And I have to clarify that I did not even study proper geology, so my guesses are likely to be unreliable and inaccurate.

This rock reminds me of gnesis and sandstone, with the bands of alternating lighter and darker layers. If it is gnesis, I would have no idea why it ended up here, so I think sandstone might be more possible? If the beach you mentioned is naturally formed (by deposition, with lands surrounding the bay weakening wave energy), then the holes might be caused by the crystallization of salt, which is called honeycomb weathering. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Firstly, remember that he is (or claims that he is) a DEMOCRATIC socialist. A socialist regime does not mean that it has to be an authoritarian regime. Nor does a capitalist country mean that it has to be a democratic country.

Secondly, USA is a country based on its people's rights. A country should be serving its own people, but not a particular system. If a system serves its people the best, whether it is capitalism, democratic socialism or socialism, then let it apply to the US. If voters think Bernie is the best for America, then let Bernie be the president. The only conditions are that

1.Bernie is not elected by populism, since populism eventually hurts democracy. Bernie does not dehumanize all people who are against his beliefs, so Bernie is not elected by populism.  He only attacks corporations and the rich, but does not attack his opponents as "un-american".

2. Bernie does not harm minorities' rights, so that its potential presidency is not the dictatorship of the majority. Bernie, instead, actively strives for LGBTQIA+ rights and racial justice.

I am a Hong Konger who supports Bernie Sanders. A country is based on its people, but not a particular system. The same is for China. China is based on its people, but not the Chinese-style socialism. If another system suits far better for its people, then a change might be necessary.


I bet I will regret commenting on something political. This comment will either be downvoted to oblivion, be ignored, or ignite another argument. But I should not care too much about karma, and debates might be beneficial anyway. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I believe that OP understands the meaning of "ok bommer", and I, as a GenZ, also do understand. However it does not change the fact that "ok bommer" is generalizing that all boomers are ignorant and do not care about future generations, which clearly is not correct. "Ok bommer" might not be intended to attack the boomer age group, but it still counts as a microaggression. (For example, I often heard the phrase "gay" used as a playful insult. The user might not mean to attack gays, but it still potentially makes closeted gays feel that being gay is wrong) Would it, in some extend, might create a stereotype that all boomers are all ignorant?"

Furthermore, is throwing out "ok boomer" really a good idea?By dismissing the argument, would it make the boomer become even more misunderstood on millenials/GenZ/others stance and continue their belief? Would it create another stereotype that the younger generarions are simply dismissive and not worth the attention, further deepening the generational conflict?

(Alternative?) "I feel unfortunate that you, at this moment, are unable to understand the argument of my stance. I, perhaps, am also preoccupied by my emotions that I simply could not agree with you. I look foward to some day when we could have a productive and peaceful conversation. Thank you for expressing your opinion."

<TEXT> Few more important points:

Recently, Jimmy Lai, founder of Apple Media, Lee Cheuk-yan, chairman of multiple pro-democracy organizations and parties, along with a member of the Democratic Party, were arrested and charged.

Carrie Lam was criticised multiple times for unable to handle the COVID-2019 effectively. She :

1.was unable to stop the skyrocketing prices of medical supplies

2.was unable to stop the panic of people buying medical masks, rice and toilet paper

3.opened isolation camps without the consent of the public and without consultation. Some camps are very close to large settlements. A public housing(which was initially planned to be open for accommodation a month later at that time) was used as isolation camp. A proposed assigned clinic for coronivirus was situated 10m from nearest settlement. As a result, RARE protests(some peaceful, some involve petrol bombs) in the epidemic period broke out.

As a result, the dissatisfaction in HK REMAINS, and perhaps even heightened. My sister even said that she heard criticisms of Lam every time she was on the streets. It is expected that political protests would break out again after the epidemic has ceased. This "peace" would only remain until the end of the epidemic breakout. </TEXT>

<TEXT> While Mandarin (Putonghua) is indeed hard, Cantonese is the more fked up version of Cantonese.

Think 4 tones are difficult? Congratulations, you have 5 MORE now. 婚(fan1, wedding) 粉(fan2, pink) 糞(fan3, faeces) 墳(fan4, grave) 憤(fan5, angry) 份(fan6, portion) 忽(fan7/fat1, suddenly) 罰(fan8/fat6, punish) 佛(fan9/fat6, buddha). (Mind if I messed up?And 佛 somehow sounds like fuck but in a lower tone and a silent ck. Fat does not make any sense.). Tone 7 8 9 are controversial on whether they should be considered as tones, because they sound like staccato versions of tone 1 3 6 respectively.

The pinyin is difficult to follow? I bet fewer than 1/10 of Cantonese users dare to use ours. 日(jat6) does not even have a j sound. No t sound either. And there will be several versions to the pinyin of a word.

Think hanzi is difficult to write? Congratulations, you should  write in more strokes now, if you want to write to much more Cantonese speakers.

Oh, by the way, Cantonese write and talk in different systems. If you write your essays in oral Cantonese, you will be scolded by your Language teachers. oral:我啲老闆係最好啲. written:我的上司是最好的.

Finally, traditional Chinese users, particularly HKers, use Changjie for typing Chinese characters. 劑(卜難中弓)，溪(水月女大)，啲(口竹日戈). Younger generations are beginning to abandon Changjie. </TEXT>

1. This is not even original. I have seen this question multiple times, and I have been on ask reddit for less than 1 year.

2. This question lacks creativity

3. This question encourages hate and makes tons of people downvote one another because they do not agree with one another. I see disrespect on every comment (DoNaLd TrUmP, LiBeRaLs...)

4. Foul language (minor issue though)

I welcome downvotes, because I expected them. Really, if you disagree, just discuss/debate with me. Downvotes should be used as a widespread "report" function rather than "I disagree and disrespect you, fk you" function. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Social media is definitely harmful  in many ways, especially Fb, IG or Twitter, where you receive info on negative news, and people posting their best parts of their lives, creating an illusion that "everyone is so happy but why aren't I", which isn't true. Reddit is a bit better though, depending on different subs. Further avoid triggers and news would be even better.

Nofap has NO known reliable scientific benefits. Relapses, if not handled properly, may create guilt. Masturabation actually helps prevent prostate cancer and temporarily improves mood. Those who need Nofap are those who are addicted to masturbation, in which they could not stop thinking about masturbation (even without the teenage hormones) and affect their daily lives significantly.This addiction is called hypersexuality and is related to bipolar disorder. Porn might create a misinterpretation of sex though, as visual effects and unrealistic expectations are created. Nofap, I think, is created as a partial joke.

However, goal setting in Nofap has psychological benefits if SMART goal method is used. I think this is the reason why some people feel better after Nofap. People claiming to feel better might also because by their consistent and regular in other fields, such as medication, activation paradox (doing hobbies even if you do not feel like it), appropriate amount and regular schedule sleep (Those who masturbatED overnight may actually benefit from this), etc.  The above methods could be used instead of Nofap. (People approaching Nofap also signifies their determination in improvement)

<TEXT> Young gay here. I came to the sub expecting to see a support network filled with people with internalised homophobia seeking for help, or something similar to r/lgbt .
But hey, sex is indeed an important element in relationships for younger people, especially when seen in a teenage prospective affected by all the hormones. Reddit is filled with young people, so I do expect seeing memes and sex topics everywhere, especially in subs such as this one where sexual orientation is the main topic.

A gay might not have sex every day, but this discussion helps a gay to know whether they are top/bottom/vers/etc. in a relationship. I imagine that I would be very frantic when I have my first experience on sex if I have no idea on my sexual position because no one talks about it. The one thing that gay sex is different from heterosexual ones is that gays have to decide their sexual position rather than it is assigned, excluding special requests. I myself still do not know "which way I fuck", so these posts are informative and even inspiring for me.

Finally I am hating how people decide to downvote, because my principle is to educate people first, and only downvote posts that are highly offensive and the person is highly unwilling to change their mindset. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The following is just my opinion, and others are welcome to have other thoughts.

I know this is likely to be downvoted (or ignored), but there are simply so many ways that define a person to be "mature", whether enotionally, mentally, physically, or in terms of life skills.These mature states are defined by your experiences in that particular area, but not defined by age. It is irrefutable that teenagers are generally less mature as they supposedly have less experiences in life. However, I dare not simply generalize that ALL teenagers are immature. There will be people who suffer from abuse or diseases, regardless of phsyical and mental. They may gain more insights from their suffering and become more mature. But of course, there is always some room for one to become more mature. And it is likely that you will look back into your past experiences and feel silly. However, I would not say that all teens are just children. This is just a general case, but it might not be applicable to all teenagers.

I welcome the "I am 14 and this is deep" kind of response, because I am just so tired and are just expressing my opinion. Everyone has different opinions, and I will try my best to respect all, while ignoring those opinions who blindly degrades other opinions. Perhaps this might be too heavy to comment on r/tumblr, and I should look to r/changemyview instead? I am not sure. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So I am not an expert, but I, as a secondary school (high school) student, I can relate to a lot of this. I have been awkward towards people I feel that are 'superior' than me. I hope I can be helpful with the suggestions here. Many of them are given by my social workers / therapists and my psychiatrist.

So firstly, I appreciate that you have the courage to reach out for help. I cam see that you are determined to improve yourself. I myself have been cowering for a long time before finally reaching help. You also seem to be observative towards your reactions and interactions. These are a good start. Observe your jnteractions with others throughout your journey of self help. You might have off days, but you surely would improve gradually.

You said that you were more confident in people of a "lower status than yourself". That is good. Then perhaps you could practice socializing with people of lower status  first. Friends usually have a common topic or trait. Awkwardness can be a common trait. You may soon realize that there are people that DO care about you and your life. You might be able to regain your confidence in socializing. People who are awkward are usually also the ones who experienced more and are more empathetic, even they might not show it easily. They can support you in your journey to self help. Adding my experience, I found someone as awkward as I was recently , and he could really connect with me intellectually. Contray to my previous experiences, when I am with him, I feel like I actually exist instead of being invisible. I believe you can do it too :)

Secondly, I noticed that you have a tendency to compare your abilities with others. This behaviour is very common and is in our human nature. One of my therapist told me that if I start feeling inferior, I could compare my abilities and find something that I am better at than the person of 'higher status'. The ability can be something 'mundane' (eg Scores at a game), a subject (eg English, History), a very specific interest (eg amount of successful times to make a cat become intrigued to music) or a personality trait (eg more empathetic and higher ability to enjoy solitude).  Make a list of your strengths if necessary. Remember that you do not have to be the very best in order to call something your strength. I find this method peculiar, but it actually helped me.

In addition, if you are feeling emotionally exhausted after a conversation (regardless of duration), this can be a normal trait of an introvert. 40% of all humans are introverts. But if you feel that you are overly anxious on how people respond to you, I think you could take a visit to a therapist/social worker. (It is just like a normal body health check~ there is nothing wrong with that. I saw that a therapist on Reddit even said that all people should have no shame on seeing a therapist, because everyone needs a therapist regularly) Therapists are suprisingly helpful for me.

I saw that someone mentioned to "not give a fuck". It is true, but it will require time to even understand the basic concepts. Let us just take it step by step. Add oil! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Okay. Maybe homophobic is not exactly the right word. That is why I used "somewhat" and added "at least can lead to misunderstanding" in the comment. I am not a native speaker, so I have less word choices.

It is clear that sexual orientations are not something to be manipulated. However, Elish wishes the boy to be gay to spare her of her feelings. This can be easily be seen as a passive manipulation of sexual orientations. It is clear that *homophobes are keen at twisting the definition of sexual orientations*. For example, they may say that gay is just a phrase, so they may just "wait for the straight phrase" or perform conversion therapy. If Elish fails to deliver a clear message that sexual orientations such as gay, bisexual, etc., are not to be manipulated or changed in *any* way, then Elish may have accidentally conveyed a 'somewhat homophobic' message.


Her explanation is also unhelpful in making her clear of homophobic accuses.

"Guess what, he just came out to me like a couple weeks ago. So I wrote the song and *made him fuck a dude.* I'm fucking proud, bro, except not really though because I was really into him, like so into him. "

She was almost like "yeah, I manipulated his sexual orientation, and yeah, I won." I guess this reflects her attitude when writing the song. (When intercepting a song, one must also consider the songwriter's background, personality and style. That is why Bohemian Rhapsody is considered as a bisexual anthem)

Yeah, she stepped some grey areas that made her facing backlash from GRSM rights supporters. But at least she is young and could learn a lesson and be more careful next time. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I think we should still remember the history of police brutality towards GRSM (eg Stonewall Riots), but not blindly saying ACAB.

If we just say ACAB, we may just worsen the relation between civilians and the police, thus worsening the problem. It is true that cops have the choice of disobeying vile orders and not oppress civilians. But if we continue to think that all cops are bastards, cops would also see civilians, particularly minorities, as enemies. This is just not improving the situation.  We might be just turning away chances for improvement by saying ACAB. Instead I think we should encourage cops who are advocating for equality among different gender, races, sexualities and romantic minorities, while raising awareness to demand action of the government (root of problem) for improving the morality of the cops. Besides, like someone had said here before, there might still be supportive cops out there wanting to change the police force for the better. Even if the police is somehow designed for oppressing government-opposing minorities, cops are still needed for law and order. The only thing we could do is to improve the police force.

Changes are slow, but things will become better. I hope somewhere in the future, we would have a real harmonious society where police brutality does not exist and no one except real criminals (Of course minorities are not real criminals. They are imaginary enemies of some cops) would think that ACAB.

If you disagree, please do not simply downvote or reply blindly with hatred. (I expect there would be someone who would reply "fuck the bourgeoisie fake democracy" and "fuck the police" ) I know that it is hard to think without anger as the world is too imperfect. Instead, please discuss civilly with me/us. Reply with reasons if necessary. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have no exact explanation on WHY this happens, but here are some more details. (HKer here, so I might have Grammar mistakes)

I have a bizzare brain. My moods can be separated into 6 main stages, but this electro-sensitive state is only related to stage no1 and no3.

Firstly, I will enter a state of high productivity. I, as a shy and introverted person, would unusually talk a lot and have a lot of ideas. This is stage no1. After this stage, it either leads to stage no.2 (introversion worn-out, which is quite normal) or stage no3, which I call it Electro-sensitivity worn-out.

3. Electro-sensitivity worn-out
Happens after 1, and 1 and 3 are separated by dining. Happens also after being exposed to much to electronic products. Sensitive to detecting electrical and magnetic movement (Even after closing my eyes), movement in general, and sound. Things seem to slow down(Another strange feature, yeah). Low productivity. Prone to headaches(worsened by electronic products, and therefore can be used to detect electrical movements), numbness, numbness-caused sadness and depression, hyperventilating, feels hopeless, loss of motivation to do anything.

My father has tested my ability by asking me to close my  eyes and see if I detect electronic products such as phones and TVs correctly. My headaches tend to worsen when I am situated near an electronic device. Therefore, at this stage, I could not use my phone, and have to stay at home. I have to stay in my own room with my phone put in the living room, as I could not bear standing near the TV. My headaches worsen even that the TV is switched off, so this proofs that my headaches are not caused by the blue light from gadgets. The worst thing is that my headaches are so annoying that they upset me, but I could not listen to music (my usual way of comforting myself) from any electronic products.


So these are the details. I think you might be more confused after reading this, especially the "feeling everything slow down" part. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I personally do not agree. I think it depends on a country's political background. China has a social background of totaltarianism for over 1000 years. That is why China has a successful totaltarianism regime. As far as I know (HKer here), some Carrie Lam supporters and Chinese even think that Both HK and CCP are democractic states. This shows their lack of knowledge towards the definition of democracy. I do not have a clear idea on India's political system, but it is irrefutable that democracy is less well-rooted in India, as democracy was originated in Europe, and the idea of democracy is foreign to Indians. People are still new to the idea of democracy, so the democratic system in India is fragile. This is my understanding.

  I believe the key factors of rapid development of LDCs are higher political stability (depends on the system people are used to, eg China has a rich history of totaltarian rule, so China can be developed quickly), lower race,cultural and religion diversity (India and African countries are a mess in this criteria, but stable ranges of Chinese control are all Han areas) and geographic concerns (too diverse range of temperature and climate is detrimental to development, so are physical barriers such as mountains).

But seriously, I am definitely NOT an experts, and my points might be wrong and unreliable. I am still in secondary school (high school). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hongkonger here. Hong Kong is stereotyped as a highly-urbanized city, but actually more than 2/3 of land are hilly and a lot of places are country parks. Unfortunately, I doubt that you would find anything particularly nice, except in the night markets or in Sham Shui Po. However I still some good quartz and calcite crystals and some layered rocks at Waterfall Bay on Hong Kong Island, near the famous waterfall. Better to go during low-tide. I am highly satisfied as a beginner. If you go during the evening, it is also appealing to see the sunset and a full eagle-shaped waterfall.

If you wish to have a geological tour, going to Sai Kung and looking at the hexagonal columnar volcanic tuff on a boat there would be nice. Almost the whole of East New Territories are country parks or are in the Hong Kong Global Geopark of China. Ma Shi Chau is known for its folding features, Tung Ping Chau is known for the sedimentary rocks there. But these sights are only for sightseeing but not for rock hunting. Not an expert, but I think many of the good rock-hunting sites are protected by law anyway. Good for sightseeing, not good for rock hunting. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have read that our mind remembers cringey things because the memory is intercepted as useful and things can be learnt from it. Therefore, I have 3 approaches to relieving my embarrassment.

Firstly, tell yourself that you have learnt from the memory that .... is a better option than ... in solving this problem. Or that it is just an accident and I can avoid it in the future by...

The second one is similar to 540's. It cannot be changed, and I forgive myself. I would like to expand on the point in which nobody cares. People would rather focus on their own embarrassing memories rather than dwelling on others'. There are likely to be no consequences to you. And if they do remember your peculiar act and laugh at you, they are pathetic for wasting brain capacity for remembering things that are in no concern of their benefits.

The third one is to do a breathing exercise. Feel air entering and escaping from your body. Then imagine that you inhale insights, improvement and forgiveness, then exhale embarrassing memories and the emotion caused by them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> famine death war pestilence

It depends on your interception, really. Depth is objective anyway. At first they are just casually joking about phone malfunctions and annoyances leading to massive impacts (apocalypse). But then someone applies these jokes into real life situations, famine, death, war and pestilence. War is caused by ignorance of other's needs, as shown in "Read", causing relationships to become distant and worsen. War has a winner and a loser, but at the end it leads to apocalypse, total destruction, meaning that no one actually benefits from war. Applying to politics nowadays, relationships and tensions are building up around the world. Examples include trade war, US interference in other countries' politics (Iran and US), conflicts within nations (China vs  Uigur, Hong Kong and Taiwan in a huge grey area). If these conflicts become major wars, it would only cause havoc (apocalypse). This conveys and anti-war and pro-peace message.

Other factors leading to apocalypse is famine, death and pestilence. This tells us to prepare for and prevent these factors. For famine, we should use sustainable farming methods, instead of burning large area of forests to create more farmland like Indonesia and Brazil. Pestilence is telling us to unite and fight against transmitting diseases. Zika virus and Ebola is still active in some African countries but is ignored by other countries. Pneumonia has broken out in Wuhan, China, but the HK police is still naively suppressing protests instead of taking precautions. The post is also about telling us to unite to fight against famine, pestilence and the resulting deaths.

So yeah, you might think this is not deep, but this is at least deep to some people. We should respect people who think that this is deep (not directed against specific people). We are living in a rather peaceful age, but we should take action to maintain a fundamental and secure peace and prosperity, such as by the government giving adequate power to the people instead of dictating. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a former Christian, I hope I can clarify this.

The core belief of Christianity is generally believed to be 1. Jesus is the son of God.  2. God of Christianity is the only God and is the saviour of our souls from sin, from demons and Satan. 3. Jesus is sent down to earth to die on a cross for human's sins, who is resurrected. 4. After death, there is heaven and hell. 5. Church is a holy place that acts as a communion of Christians and saints. 6. The Bible has an authority in the ethics of Christianity

The belief in Bible is written by humans. Some of them might be saints, but they are still vulnerable to sin. Nowadays, the Bible is printed, but in the ancient times, the Bible is hand-written and translated by Christians. Therefore, there might be errors or even personal beliefs in the Bible nowadays. We should seek the truth of the original Bible. However, it is impossible to do so. That it is why I intercept this as that we should follow the Bible, but not RELY on the Bible to intercept morality. I think the "Belief in Bible" thing means to be the details of the Bible nowadays, which can be different from the original Christianity, and this separates the belief of God and belief of the Bible.

Also, I want to point of that some studies (with reliability unknown for me) have found out that some homophobic lines in Bible are deliberately incorrectly translated to convey an opposition in same-sex relations. </TEXT>

If you are looking for a serious answer, no, you cannot. Lava is extremely hot, that it might melt the plastic you are standing on. Then at some point you will be cooked to death. Your enzymes(for food and respiration) will permanently stop working due to being denatured, your proteins in muscles might also be denatured. If you have a bruise, it might let hot air go in and evaporate all your blood. You also might be burned up,as lava triggers fires.

If your purple pineapple is being considered, proteases
 in pineapple will be denatured, water from it will be evaporated, and the purple pigments might evaporate as well.

Given enough protective gear, with fire-proof and heat-proof surfaces, materials, and structures for your body and your surfboard, you can surf on it. However, you are not advised to do so, as it is dangerous, AND IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH FUN, SINCE MOST LAVA COOLS AND SOLIDIFIES AS IT FLOWS. </TEXT>

Peculiarly, it is also close to nature and has stunning "small town" landscapes with large amount of parks. Amsterdam is NOT only about red light district. I am underaged but still had fun there. The food is great. In addition, the people there are nice (and good-looking), and I have encountered no racism (A  Hong Kong Chinese). I think also think that Amsterdam  is relatively GRSM-friendly.

<TEXT> Many of my favourites are here, but if we are talking about UNDERRATED lyrics, it has to be "Oh there's a light" from Weight of Living Pt1. Often being overlooked this lyric uses simply four words to convey a complicated meaning, and is a metaphor, and also a reference from Rime of the Ancient Mariner.

A man all light, a seraph-man,

On every corse there stood.


This seraph-band, each waved his hand:

It was a heavenly sight!

They stood as signals to the land,

Each one a lovely light;

The lyric is referencing these lines, the saviour from disasters, and a relief of forgiveness. The lines referenced are in the second last part of the poem, indicating an end of suffering. However the song does not end there, indicating that he is suffering from guilt from himself, an unending suffering. That is why guilt is a "weight of living", not a weight of a moment. The repitition also heightens its significance in the song, yet most would ignore it. Perhaps people are overlooking the metaphor, perhaps it is the poor Genius explanation, people do not talk about this magnificent lyric. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes. Unfortunately, Kpop fans tend to have zero concerns on the social and political situation of North and South Korea. The music might be appealing for certain people, but I find Kpop fans tend to focus on fetishzing their idols instead of focusing on their personalities or their voices. Some even ignore Kpop star's mental health problems. The worst thing is that this kind of culture is spreading to other popular fanbases. </TEXT>

Rule 5: Do not tell anyone about rule 4. Lure someone to break rule 4 to play safe.

That is why mum seems to be hiding something, and said to "call" if OP needs help. She knows about the girl, but she does not talk about it to the family. This is also why rule 5 is the last rule.

OP, hope you will be safe, even I doubt that you will </TEXT>

Your response is really poetic and romantic, but I am sorry that you have to go through this. I am gay and have a homophobic mother who avoids talking about sex. We have great relationships, so I also fear that me coming out would ruin everything for me. Also, I know that GRSM are having a hard time, but I do not realise that aces in particular are so disrespected. I hope you and OP would have a nice future ahead. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hongkonger here. The police, the government, some of the radical protesters, but mostly the police. No one is in the mood for Christmas here. In addition, Australian fires and Chilean protest brutality also leave a brutal scar on the atmosphere. Most of the Christmas decorations in shopping centres here are removed in fear of damage and potential fires set by radical protesters and tear gases. Basically most families are trapped inside their homes in fear at night. Traditional Christmas celebration areas such as Mong Kong, Tsim Sha Tsui and Lan Kwai Fong are expected to be eeriely quiet by nine.


In addition to political situations, my examinations and my mental health also ruined Christmas for me. Luckily I have my Bastille Christmas playlist. </TEXT>

English teachers, on the other hand, are usually quite kind and compassionate in my point of view.

Edit: I am also not a sporty guy. Particularly hate basketball.

<TEXT> >They're generally in jail for a reason...

Mostly yes. But if you have read books by Angie Thomas, you might learn that blacks are suffering from systematic discrimination, so that their education is poorer and they are more likely to be poor. They cannot find a job, so this force them to commit crimes such as burglar, selling drugs, doing illegal prostitution and joining gangs. They get arrested, have a criminal record, making them even harder to find jobs. These crimes are not right, of course, but if whites get more chance to be a better person, they do should have a chance to be bailed out.

It is all about attitude. Both the polite man and the rude man are mistreated by society. They suffer a lot due to their homelessness and poverty. It is normal for them to be bitter and angry towards other people. However, the polite one still treats other people with kindness. This indicates that he is a nicer person and would not direct his dissatisfaction towards others. If I were OP, I would simply give away food in appreciation. The rude one redirects his anger and desperation towards others through demanding others. This act is inconsiderate and indicates a lack empathy. Those who are sufferring should not make innocents suffer as well.

OP is likely to have not enough food for both of them. With the attitude differences, dispite that they are still human being and deserve food and shelter, the polite one deserve better. </TEXT>

Then bring up some a little more personal, such as where they are going. After that you might want to talk about something about each other, such as your interests. Make sure you talk about something that you are/sound enthusiastic in. To let both of you contribute, you might as well ask questions, avoiding definite answers that may end the discussion quickly.

However these are only general suggestions. These methods cannot be applied in all situations. Practice will make conversations smoother. Add oil! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I had a crush with a fictional character (Casper Wyoming) and imagined having sex with him, AND masturbated to my imaginery image of him. I did not know the term 'gay' then, so I was just confused. Few months later, I had a crush on another fictional character and learnt the word 'gay' by hearing it as a slur. I was in denial and did a bunch of inaccurate sexual orientation quizzes. I accepted that I was gay 1 year later  after I travelled to the Netherlands.

I decided to use the name of the character which contributed to my sexual awakening as my username. Literally my gayness is shown (subtly) in my username. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I am somehow of a stereotypical gay man. I am more feminine than many other men. As a child, I played with dolls. I did not like video games or sport. I enjoyed reading more than most of the girls I knew, not to mention boys. I cried a lot. I always get along with girls more than with boys. I was convinced with the gender stereotypes that I believed I should be a girl. Also, at that time, I did not know gay was a thing. If I were a girl, then I would be straight. As a result, I questioned my gender. You may assume that I am a trans woman, but I am comfortable with being a man. Only stereotypes and my inability to fit in the male culture make me uncomfortable with my male identity . </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let us do some analysis and interceptions:

The frog symbolises the nature, while the skeleton represents the human culture.

The skeleton is drawn as a monstrous figure, while the frog is drawn as a parent protecting its child. This possibly symbolises that the humans are trying to take something from other organisms, possibly their environment for dieting, making tools or other selfish uses. This can also mean that the nature is standing against the human culture to protect its future generations.

Therefore, the painting shows the rivalrous relationship of humans and the nature, and that the painter wanted to bring out that the humans should stop selfishly use the nature's resources, and should work out a sustainable way to develop civilization.

Not a very good analysis, but still an analysis </TEXT>

<TEXT> For most of the younger generations, it is indeed a thing that we take for granted. Actually the 'we' in your question is quite subjective. For people in underdeveloped countries, no one would take water as something for granted. Similarly, for younger people who rarely get sick and have no mental illnesses, everyone take it as something for granted. It is the environment, the situation and our own state that decides whether we take something for granted. However, it is hard to know what environment, situation and state you are in. For me, everyone I know takes health as something for granted, so for me, I am answering your question. </TEXT>

<TEXT> China is not 70 years old. It is 4000+ years old. And the 3930+ years of culture and history are destroyed by a government named PRC, despite that it does not belong to the people, for that it is a dictatorship, and it should not be named 'China' as well. China has a rich culture ,and no Chinese government would be dumb enough to destroy its own culture, AND degrade her people into mob and mindless followers. And this 'PRC' is claiming that there are 'foreign influences', even though PRC is founded partly through foreign influences. Therefore, I hate people equalling CCP/PRC to China. CCP is NOT China. I refuse to recognise CCP as China. </TEXT>

> I don't think he was the smartest of his kind, since he was hangin in a place that probably wouldn't catch a lot.

1. Daddy Long legs usually create a web in a dark corner, which is why you think he is very dumb


>d his webskills were "not the best" (which is a blatant euphemism

2. Daddy long legs have a messy and irregular web, so his ability of making webs are perfectly normal


>The next morning I found the moths on the floor.

3. Daddy long legs usually do not eat the whole prey. When they finish eating the prey, they dump it onto the floor, which is why you would find dead wasps and moths on the floor


>The next morning he was gone. Just gone. Nothing. Not even weaving me goodbye. I was pretty sad but thought he probably needed something else in his life. So I moved on, as hard as it was.

>Today I chilled on my balcony, reminiscing about my life choices. And guess who I found, just on the other side of the window. Yes. A daddy long legs, hangin around innocently in the corner of the other side of the handrail. Just outside.

4. When the webs of Daddy long legs are damaged, they see this as a threat and will move away, so it explains why he left you </TEXT>

<TEXT> For the people asking for the information on the six men that have died for the protest, here is it. However, I also cannot really keep up with the suicides and left the last one out. I rely on the source below.
Link of source (in Chinese): https://evchk.wikia.org/zh/wiki/%E3%80%8A%E9%80%83%E7%8A%AF%E6%A2%9D%E4%BE%8B%E3%80%8B%E4%BF%AE%E8%A8%82%E9%A2%A8%E6%B3%A2%E4%B9%8B%E9%80%A3%E7%BA%8C%E8%87%AA%E6%AE%BA%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6

The six men refers to the people that have committed suicide because of the events happening in HK and/or because of large disagreements over political issues with their parents. Most of them have evidence of actively participating in the protests.

The 1st man that have committed suicide, and the most widely known one, died from jumping a roof at Pacific Place in Admiralty on 15/6 before the 2M protest. He was wearing a yellow raincoat with the words 黑警冷血，林鄭殺港 (Cold blooded HK Police, Carrie Lam killed Hong Kong) written on it, and he put up a banner with slogans on it at Pacific Place before committing suicide. His suicide somehow led to even more suicides and attempted suicide in HK.

The 2nd suicide was on 29/6. A young woman committed suicide in Ka Fuk Estate in Fanling. She wrote down protest slogans and a 100-words passage on a wall.

The 3rd suicide was on 30/6 during a so-called pro-police  gathering. A woman committed suicide in IFC. She wrote down pro-protest messages on her Facebook.

The 4th suicide was on 3/7. A woman supporting the protests committed suicide on Castle Peak Road in Cheung Sha Wan. She wrote a final wish to achieve democracy for HK.

The 5th suicide was on 22/7. A man committed suicide after a huge argument over politics with his parents in Kwong Yuen Estate in Sha Tin.

I could not find info on the 6th suicide, but it is known that there are many more people that have committed suicide due to the political situation in HK.

And finally, please know that life is precious. We could not afford losing any one of you. If you are struggling with mental issues, PLEASE seek help from any person you would like to. Outlive and outnumber your enemies.
香港人加油! 一個也不能少! 要長命過我哋啲敵人!

You have mentioned 'these days', so I wouldn't say anything more about history and the political compass of China in the past. I might be misguided anyway.

I wouldn't deny that there are similarities between them. Like I said before, there are indeed some similarities. I do not support CCP anyway. Though I am not sure whether people idolize Xi. I am not mainland Chinese.

<TEXT> Ironically, firstly, I am NOT a mainland Chinese. I am actually a HKer. Secondly, I am NOT a supporter of CCP. I am just a supporter of Chinese and HKers and trying to oppose Japanese, Axis Powers, Nazi Germany and communist China at the same time. Hong Kong has faced hardship under Japanese occupation. Japanese are allies with Nazi Germany, and Nazis are inhumane generally, so I oppose the Nazis. I am ashamed to have you to my side. I have been using a logical tone all along, so I do not understand why, a person who are supposedly also oppose CCP, would talk to me in such a rude way. I support Chinese as a race, not as slaves of communism and oppression. I would support a democratic and humane China in the future. By the way, if you have read through my comments, you would see I am actually VERY sensitive. Bet you won't read through this. Thank you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Please understand that we Chinese/HKers are especially sensitive to these WWII-related stuffs, and we have a proper reason to be that sensitive. Japanese, allies of Nazi Germany, have killed hundreds of thousands of people inhumanely in China. Putting the swatiska sign on the emblem somehow indicates loss of China to the Axis Powers, which is not quite acceptable here. Thank you very much. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I get your point. The designer puts swatiska onto the national emblem simply suggests the idea that what the CCP does is no different than what nazi does, given to CCP's genocide and the reducational camps. It ignores the fact that historically, communists (far left), are enemies with Nazis (far right). The position should also be fixed. To express the idea above, the designer should overlap the whole of CCP's emblem with swatiska, not putting swatiska to the centre of the emblem.

For some parts of the world, China is viewed as trying to take over the world, given the rapidly increasing influence of China to African countries, Taiwan and HK. Some might also see CCP as one that disrespects and destroys minorities' cultures and languages. I wish to give no opinions to the ideas above.

Despite everything, calling someone a commie to someone who only points out historical facts is a bit ignorant. </TEXT>

<TEXT> But, from my experience, there are homophobes who use gay as an insult. Besides, 'gay' as an insult has a homophobic history as well. Even when some non-homophobes uses gay as an insult, it can cause misunderstanding, especially among people with age gaps. Therefore, I would rather not use it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> HK Protests are sad and depressing, but not because they are happening and growing violent. Instead, it is because of the reason behind how many people have to and are 100% willing to get on the streets, not afraid of police violence. It is becuase of how many people are hurt, some severely, some are blinded, because of the HK police. It is because of the gov not willing to listen to 2 million people's voice, making protesters have to use violent means. It is because of the Police are continuously using dirty and inhumane tactics, such as throwing tear gas in an MTR station and sending undercover police to do violent acts and arrest protesters. It is because HK is, to an extend,in chaos and fear, but the gov DOES NOTHING USEFUL to calm the citizens of HK down. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This shows that some people in PRC think that the whole protests thing happening in HK is an anti-China movement and they think that those who support the protests are traitors to the nation. While there ARE some people who seek independence from China, many of the protesters are actually Democratic Party supporters. They seek making the whole of China a democratic nation.
But the protests are against the officials of the CCP. It is hard to make it not seem as being against the nation and the Chinese. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry for involving #Hong Kong politics, but Bastille often talks about politics, so....

  I really identify with most songs in Doom Days because of the recent tragedies happening in Hong Kong, my hometown. I think most of you should know something about it. Doom Days talks about an apocalyptic night, which, pathetically, suits all people in HK.
  Although my favourite songs are Divide, 4AM and Those Nights, I really identify with Million Pieces, Those Nights and The Waves. It really breaks my heart in million pieces when I have to talk about politics to my friends and when watching the news. My favourite lyrics from the song is 'The Echos of that news ring loud, no music ever drown it out'.
  The Waves uses music notes to create an imagery of waves crashing down again and again, and I really appreciate it. My favourite lyrics from the song are 'so here we are, escaping from the world outside' and 'is it an apocalypse or nihilism on your lips'.
   Finally, Those Nights rings in my head whenever I struggle with mental issues or simply feeling hopeless. My favourite lyrics from the song are 'Looking for a little bit of hope these days, looking for somebody you can wake up with' and 'I'll be the rabbit in the headlights'.

  Some lyrics from Doom Days, Divide, Another Place are also quite worth mentioning. Here they are:

"I don't care if we're talking 'bout the same things
I don't care if we're stuck in the familiar
I don't care if we're going 'round in circles
Again, again, again"

"Why would we divide, when we could come together?"

"Think I'm addicted to my phone, my scrolling horrorshow, I'm live-streaming the final days of Rome"

" We'll stay offline so no one gets hurt
Hiding from the real world
Just don't read the comments ever, ever"

"Man, this echo chamber's getting loud"

"Don't make promises to me that you're gonna break"

"Don't paint wonderful lies on me that wash away"

(I have written the last two sentences on several Lennon Walls) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do not necessarily agree with some of the acts by the protesters. However, pathetically, these might be the only way the government would listen to the people, after 1/4 of the HK population protested against the government on 16/6/19. After the strike on 16.6, protests going violent are, unfortunately, inevitable. Also, the HK Police Force and the government are also continuously playing dirty and do inhumane acts towards the protesters and the innocents. Some policemen sexually assaulted a protester. Policemen repeatedly used guns aiming towards the head and expired tear gas. Policemen allowing mobs to attack protesters have occured and numerous police officers attacking an unarmed protester is not rare. Recently, a tear gas was thrown INSIDE an MTR station, hurting innocents. I hate to see protesters throwing bricks at police and doing many more inconsiderate acts, but they are understandable, with the frustration and anger of the citizens of HK towards the police. What we can do now is to advise protesters to avoid acting the same way as the despicable police force. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I feel deeply for Hong Kong and for your situation, with all those police violence, ignorance and immoral acts. These days have been quite dark for all of us. Please, do not feel guilty for taking a break from the horrors of the world and stop reading the news for a while. YOU are important too. Take care of yourself. Outlive and outnumber your enemies. If you are feeling depressed for some period of time, please consider seeking help from a social worker or from a friend or relative. Some social workers in Hong Kong offer free service. Take care.  香港加油! 香港人加油! 一個也不能少!


This is also for all of you. Take care. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Absolutely agree. As a local, I have been supporting the  protesters since May, but please, everyone, think before act. I know it is quite hard to be rational and calm right now, but please, take care of the innocents instead of hurting and intimidating them, and think of the consequences of your actions. Do they really worth the price? And finally, thank you for raising your voice for this issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Gluttony is used to describe someone not being able to control themselves, (particularly on the issue of eating)

Sloth basically is a stronger alternative to lazy

And lust means lacking self-control on the urge to have sex and would do harmful things for love and sex.

<TEXT> Cassandra Clare's books include quite a number of LGBTQ+ characters. So far, she has included gay, bisexual, lesbian, transgender and asexual characters in her books. I really love the story behind the transgender character, but my favourite Clare's LGBTQ+ book is The Red Scrolls of Magic, which basically talks about the adventures of 2 LGBTQ+ couples.

Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda is a gay romance that involves the problem of coming out among LGBTQ+ people. It is also quite a good read. Adam Silvera's books are also good LGBTQ+ reads. </TEXT>
