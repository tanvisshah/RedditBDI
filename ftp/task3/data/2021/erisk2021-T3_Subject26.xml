<TEXT> i love the handmade clay masks from cleopatra's secret :) recently, the oiliness from my face was starting to get out of hand, so i used their glowboosting clay mask to try and control the oiliness. afterwards, my skin finally calmed down (so did my pores), and using their clay masks helps keep my oily combi skin in check. (calming calendula and matcha anti-stress are my faves from them!)

they also have their eye of horus eyelash serum, which i can say works pretty well for my lashes and brows. it comes with a spoolie attached, so it's easy to apply and keep in a bag.

i've tried their foaming facial wash and i personally don't recommend it, bc even if you have oily skin, bc of the foam, it might strip your skin of its natural oils and leave u even more prone to breakouts bc your skin has become too dry.

i have also tried their skin brightening serum, but it didn't really do much for me either.

overall, i recommend trying out this brand if you enjoy using clay face masks :) i use both serum masks and clay masks, and their clay masks have never made me break out, despite having sensitive combination skin. </TEXT>

<TEXT> it depends if i have someone in mind! i usually go mystery island hopping with a certain villager as a goal, but most of my villagers i‚Äôve got rn is bc i kinda caved in and invited them instead haha

after i see who the villager is, if i don‚Äôt want them on my island, i skip all resources and at most, scan beaches for diy bottles. this is to save time, bc it is time-consuming and i try to find a villager before the day ends

edit: good luck with your dreamie search btw! :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I have the following items/materials up for grabs:

* \[17\] full stacks of branches
* \[13\] full stacks of clay
* \[9\] full stacks of hardwood
* \[2\] full stacks of soft wood
* \[3\] full stacks of stone
* \[2\] full stacks of iron nuggets
* \[2\] full stacks of clumps of weeds
* \[6\] pink hydrangea starts
* \[7\] holly starts
* \[7\] blue hydrangea starts
* \[3\] saplings
* \[2\] cedar saplings

And these are my spare DIYs:

* Log garden lounge
* Gold-screen wall
* Lucky gold cat
* Tall garden rock
* Classic pitcher
* Basement flooring

Figured it'd be a waste if I just sold it off to Nooks. Let me know if you want anything/qty. of what material you'd like, and I'll DM you a dodo code so you can pick it up. ~~^(Please help me and my storage)~~ </TEXT>

but some of the listings do go pretty far, yes. i‚Äôve only made [MO] posts for my own villagers though, bc i want them to be adopted by someone who‚Äôd rly appreciate them. i‚Äôll admit, i made a [LF] post for raymond as well, but after seeing input from others, i was only helping the environment that put such a high price on him. (i eventually got him without nmts through the campsite method btw) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hello!

This morning, I've reached that inevitable point where my house storage had completely filled up, so I decided instead of just selling the items to Nook's, maybe I'd gift the items to others who could use them instead! There are a few rattan furniture thrown into the mix as well.

My orchard is also available, so if you're missing any fruit, feel free to take some as well. Kicks is here and Able's is also open!

Please comment below and I'll DM you a Dodo code. ^(I do apologise in advance for all the custom flooring, I'm trying to make a rock garden and it's Kinda Tedious.)

**Edit**: Will do groups of 2-3 people at a time. TYSM!

Edit 2: Thanks so much to everyone who came by :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don't think it *needs* a remake, it's already timeless and good on its own. For me, IDK how they'd be able to preserve the iconic cheekiness if they're going for a more realistic approach. Though I'd like to see how they'll develop the characters, since the character development in RE2/3Make was really good.

Also I'm kinda nervous about this since it's my first and most favourite RE game.

Other than that, I feel like Capcom would skimp on the other unlockables though, like Ada's Assignment and Separate Ways. Maybe it'll be like RE7's DLC or we'll get something different instead.

With the RE engine, Vertugo and regenerators would probably look terrifying. I'd definitely give it a try out of my love for RE4, but I don't see why Capcom needs to remake *every* single game. </TEXT>

\- nichido clear brow gel and benefit's precisely my brow pencil for a neater-looking arch
\- happy skin multi-use mousse in flamingo for a natural rosy flush
\- in2it brush-tip liquid eyeliner for small wings to make my eyes stand out more
\- nature republic real matte lipstick in brick velvet + sometimes i dab a bit of vaseline rosy lip therapy for a sheen without the heaviness or stickiness of a gloss

it's not much, pero it makes me look like i'm an actual person instead of something that crawled out of the TV at 3 in the morning </TEXT>

<TEXT> My friend did my brows for me once, and she did my brows the same way she did hers; with a very heavy hand and lots of dark brow mascara.

In the end, I basically looked like I had fuzzy dark caterpillars on my face. She said it looked "Amazing" and even though I knew it was a Hot Mess, I didn't want to make her feel bad.

People were staring at me the entire time after that, and as soon as I got home, I started scrubbing the brows off right away

Also, each time I get my brows waxed at Benefit, I don't get why the brow tech's go-to brow application is like the 2017-2018 instagram brow

It makes my brows look larger than before I had them waxed. Once I'm out of eyeshot, I bring out my compact mirror and scrub some of the brow product off so I can be seen in public again </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe spend some time away from him? If you date other people to try and forget him, I think it may only remind you of him further. You could try focusing on yourself first, find a new hobby! Get to know yourself better.

These feelings may fade away in time with a change in pace. I think openly communicating him before you stop spending time apart will help set boundaries too.

Good luck, I‚Äôve been in the same position before and it isn‚Äôt easy at all haha </TEXT>

<TEXT> Kinda small but I missed when my sims could have crushes on other sims (not everything is requited), as it could make for good storytelling.

I also miss having more in-depth pre-made Sims with stories I'd actually be *invested* in. In TS4, they're just *there*, and lack the charm they'd had in TS2.

And when it comes to things, such as sims catching their SOs cheating on them, it'd be better if there were something more than a sad/angry moodlet for something that's actually so impactful.

Also, I don't really *need* open worlds, but if your sim is in a neighbourhood with a park or beach, I wish they didn't have to "travel" to what was already an outdoor lot </TEXT>

<TEXT> I used the witch hazel toner from thayer‚Äôs bc I‚Äôve seen ppl raving about it for the longest time. It never really improved anything for me, and in my case, actually made things worse for my skin, especially on my cheeks. The skin thinned down and made my pores look super huge and led to patchy dry skin and breakouts.

If it works for you, then great! But like any product, it‚Äôs not always for everyone.

I‚Äôve since stopped using the toner on my face and found myself leaning more to hydrating toners to try and get my skin to how it was looking before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> they also have a branch in Greenbelt that also has their makeup. their eyeliner pencils (the type you sharpen) are really good, the matte shadows are also nice. the terracotta shade is my favourite. they also have glitter liners; it‚Äôs best used as a topper for shadows, I‚Äôve found.

the highlighter stick that was supposed to give you a dewy finish isn‚Äôt that good. it has a type of tackiness and the faux dewiness doesn‚Äôt last particularly long.

i haven‚Äôt tried the rest of their face products, but most of the eye products i‚Äôve tried were quite good. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I‚Äôm in love with colours so my HG is my BH Cosmetics Take Me Back To Brazil palette! I have the JC x Morphe one and I can definitely say that the BH Cosmetics palette blends so much better and seamlessly. For nude days, my go-to is the Juvia‚Äôs Place The Saharan palette, since it has all the shades I need to create a nude eye look or smoky eye.

If you can spend more on quality eyeshadows, it‚Äôll be so much more worth it and enjoyable. :D </TEXT>

<TEXT> I hate my face in general

I‚Äôm like at the crossroads between thinking I don‚Äôt look asian enough (because of east asian beauty standards enforced on us) and thinking i don‚Äôt look like any type of distinguishable nationality.

I hate that I‚Äôm short (5‚Äô2‚Äù) and that I‚Äôm so fat. I hate that I gained 20kg after my mom got sick and I never recovered from it. I tried to go to the gym but my depression would just get to me and I‚Äôd find myself in all these slumps.

Sometimes I wish I had a new body to start over with, one without all the stretch marks and blemishes. There are days I can‚Äôt even look in the mirror. Everyone says I look fine but I look in the mirror and all I see is ugly.

I feel like this body is already broken so I don‚Äôt want to try anymore. It might be body dysmorphia. But it might actually be me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is why I stopped using fb, among other reasons :)))) one time i saw a pic ppl were commenting ‚ÄòAmen‚Äô on. It was a person hanging from a noose. I reported it and questioned why people were blindly saying ‚ÄòAmen‚Äô to something like that. The amens just kept pouring in.

When someone is murdered, uncensored photos will always come up on ur feed with ‚Äòcondolences‚Äô or threats of retribution. Same goes for animal cruelty and people thinking they‚Äôre doing SOMETHING by sharing it and commenting how they‚Äôre going to torture animal abusers

It‚Äôs not a good space to be in. My coworker rn worked for FB and reviewed posts. Said it was taxing for others. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi! I did my own makeup for my graduation, so here are some of the products I used that could work for you too, and some tips on application:

* **Foundation** \- definitely the Fit Me foundation from Maybelline-- once you set it, it usually has a very seamless finish, especially when you use it with a sponge. It's a matte finish, but if you want a dewy finish, or if you have dry-to-combi/dry skin, you can use face oil so it won't cling to the dry patches on your face!
* **Setting powder** \- for setting powder, I suggest using an angled stippling brush and a powder foundation, and using buffing motions to set the product into your skin. It helps the makeup last longer, especially if it's hot (because of the lights).
* **Eyeshadow looks** \- this one is up to what you'd like, but a classic one would be a warm-tone or nude smoky eye. You can also do a halo eye if you'd like!
* **Blush** \- Rockateur from Benefit is a nice, natural shade. The tomato blush from Careline is good too, just make sure to tap off the excess first bc it's easy to go overboard.
* **Lip color** \- Matte nude shades would work since they have lasting power! The powder mattes from Maybelline have a good formula, such as Touch of Nude, Touch of Spice, or Toasted Brown. They're non-drying and easy to apply. You can apply using a lip brush for more precise application. Kinda Sexy and Velvet Teddy from MAC are also nice peachy nude shades. If you want a classic red, you can also get Russian Red from MAC or NARS Dragon Girl (lip pencil).
* **Hair style** \- if you're adept with a hair curler, you can just do voluminous, large curls.

Since these pictures are basically for life lol, I suggest you *practise* what you have in mind! Test out different eyelooks and see which you like best. Hope this helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have literally never heard of this lol. Imagine investing 15k in something that could very well never take off. Those who buy into that r/MLM scam are only going off the possibility of *if* the company is listed in NASDAQ. That's a long time until you'll be able to recover your money-- *maybe*.

I feel bad for all the people gullible enough to buy into this. I suggest you talk to your staff before they actually put any more of their funds into a company like that.

<TEXT> tbh I have wondered about this before, but from what I've noticed in our history, there's a higher prevalence of mass murders or massacres, rather than there are serial killers. though I'm not sure if you'd call the increasing trend of joy killers riding on motorcycles serial killers as well.

and I think that the police/NBI/ whoever would need a *very* solid and unified database in order to connect the murders more efficiently. it might also depend on the type of DNA left at the crime scene as well.

though, just because we don't hear about serial killers often in our news doesn't mean that they don't exist. some could have committed many murders already. i could see the local authorities turning a blind eye to it if it were someone with a specific background (i.e., sex worker, homeless persons, people with a history of criminal activity) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ok so i used to be on their PR list

Their lip and cheek rollys are nice! I LOVED their foundation and the contour kit was really nice. I also used their primer + blur cream and it did help with a natural, flawless finish, but the product itself dried out pretty easily for me (maybe bc of the packaging). The lipsticks were okay, my fave shade was Norma for a MLBB kinda vibe. Could use a bit more of a slip though, since the lipsticks I used were kinda hard.

IMO it‚Äôs overall a good, affordable brand depending on the products you buy. Haven‚Äôt tried any of their serums or skincare yet though lol </TEXT>

and i learned that a skin-like finish suited me best instead of caking my makeup on like on instagram, and i could still go all out with rainbow coloured eyeshadow!

i rarely set my foundation with powder anymore, but when i do, one thing that really increases my makeup's lasting power is if i buff the powder foundation into my skin using a stippling brush with upward motions. </TEXT>

I‚Äôve never followed fansites on twt and now I‚Äôm lowkey glad I never did. I saw that clip of JK mouthing ‚Äòcarrotnuna‚Äô and I feel so bad for him that he remembered and recognised someone that had harassed him.

Once blacklisted, I get if they‚Äôre banned from the fan caf√©, but are they banned from anywhere else? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have the UV perfect bright face milk (pink) and tbh I find it really drying on my cheeks as I have combination skin. One time I tried it without moisturising beforehand and it actually made dry patches on my face. I read reviews online and apparently this one is really good for mattifying oily skin. If you have combi skin, I suggest you moisturise beforehand so it‚Äôs easier on your skin.

It also makes my face look really white, so keep that in mind if you‚Äôre applying any face products on top of it, since it can make your foundation look super light and not match your neck. I know that from experience lol

So far, I've been tempted to buy like at least *one* mini palette, since my brain is telling me I absolutely *need* one if ever I need to do my makeup on the go. Which is ridiculous because I always do my makeup at home before I leave the house. And, as far as small palettes go, I'm already good with my JP The Saharan palette since it isn't *that* big.

That, and restocking on sunflower and sweets serum even though I still have 95% of my bottle left. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, I guess it's sort of like this: you have your own tastes and preferences, BTS have theirs. They're growing as musicians, and experimenting with more different types of music. They're constantly evolving their sound, and really, it could take some musicians *years* to find their niches. BTS are in a league of their own.

Personally, though I'm a new ARMY, I enjoy *all* of their releases, from hip-hop to their more EDM-sounding tracks. I've experienced this same discourse with another band I've been following for years-- *Bring Me The Horizon*. Their current discography sounds nothing like their debut album, but for me, that's okay. I guess that's why I don't mind if BTS experiment with their music-- they really *are* musicians, after all. They don't just *make music*. That's sort of why I admire them so much.

If you've outgrown their current music, I suppose you can find some other musicians to cater to what you'd like. No one's coercing you to continue to listen to their newer music. You don't have to force yourself to like it either. There's so much music out there, I'm sure you'll find something you enjoy! </TEXT>

He laughed bitterly. "And that's why I want to run and play," he said. "I want to be a leaf blown by the wind over hills. I want to die and be born again. I am, you see, weary and want to be made clean. I am an amateur venturing timidly into lives," he concluded. "I am weary and want to be made clean. I am covered by creeping crawling things."

<TEXT> My resolutions as an ARMY:
- interact with other ARMYs more‚Äî I usually only hang out in Discord during livestreams or sometimes comment on posts in this sub, but I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to about BTS. I guess it‚Äôs bc I tend to keep to myself? Either way it‚Äôs a work in progress lol
- Take the time to learn how to love myself and be kinder to others. I can‚Äôt say I truly love myself if I‚Äôm not kind to others as well. I guess my actions could also reflect back to BTS and ARMY so it‚Äôs an extra measure to self-evaluate myself and keep myself in check.
- Learn at least *some* Korean lol. I literally don‚Äôt know anything aside from ‚Äòannyeong‚Äô, ‚Äònan molla‚Äô, ‚Äòhangsang‚Äô and ‚Äòjimin is a fool‚Äô (thanks V!)
- Learn at least 1 dance‚Äî I‚Äôm thinking Pied Piper because it‚Äôs shorter
- Help out with a charitable cause! Ever since I‚Äôve been in college I‚Äôve always wanted to do charity work on my own. Now that I‚Äôm an ARMY and I‚Äôve realised ARMY goes out of their way to help others, I think there was an internal alignment where I realised, ‚ÄòOh. This is where I‚Äôm supposed to be‚Äô.
- Don‚Äôt get lazy with voting/streaming and using hashtags

They break me out so bad. :( I guess there‚Äôs something in those foundations that irritates my skin, so I‚Äôve been using tinted foundations instead. Because of this I‚Äôm super wary of kbeauty face cosmetics now (though I can use lip/cheek tints just fine)

Goodbye to silicone based primers as well. They tend to pill underneath my foundation and clog my pores, even if I just pat it on there.

Starting to phase out using a blending sponge as well, since i‚Äôve been using a foundation brush more often. I use less product and get a less streaky finish when I do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely, there‚Äôs a lot of more mature people in our fandom now, but we can‚Äôt deny that there are immature people who‚Äôd really take it as a personal offence.

I think that the immature ARMYs would cause a lot of noise, but compared to the rest of our fandom, would only be a minority. I think that the rest of our fandom would make memes and funny posts about it and how the other members would react to it.

I have hope in our fandom! We‚Äôre like a family, after all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I just got the skintint and I'm liking it so far :D it brings life back to my face lol. do note that it's rly sheer bc it's a tinted moisturiser though! it absorbs easily into the skin once you work the product all over your face and it dries down easily, even if I used an oil + regular moisturiser before applying. it didn't completely cover up my dark circles but i managed with some concealer. it's really lightweight and doesn't feel like there's any product on your face.

but you can always mix your moisturiser with foundation! that's what i did before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> i bought a JS liquid lipstick in the shade [Queen Supreme](https://www.freyja.com/ph/jeffree-star-cosmetics-queen-supreme-velour-liquid-lipstick-jfc815446020525.html), bc I wanted something 'different and unique'. No surprise, it was SUPER pigmented. The colour is so bright, the only way I can pull it off is if I do something for more editorial purposes. I can't actually wear this outside. To think I paid P1300 for this OMG. I wish I just set aside my pride and got one of the more popular wearable shades instead.

I can't even sheer it out bc my entire lips lighten whenever i apply it using my finger

I've literally not worn this once. I'm thinking I can maybe use it as eyeliner as well, but there's like a whole tube I need to go through first LOL

for regret #2, I got 2 liquid lipsticks from Ellana for around 500 PHP, because it was like B1T1. BUT OMG!! they're so drying. they leave my lips looking crusty af and even though it wasn't as expensive as the JS liquid lipstick, this formula just made it super unbearable. the only way i managed to make the wear more comfortable is by topping a maybelline powdered matte lipstick on top, which kinda defeats the purpose of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was prescribed tretinoin by my derma some time ago, but when my acne started to get really bad recently, I started using it again. It helped, but my skin couldn‚Äôt handle using it 2 days in a row! My skin started peeling and it hurt to even just put moisturiser.

It‚Äôs really really strong, so I suggest using small amounts (pea sized maximum) and using it once a week, giving ur face a break in between applications. You can build a tolerance to it and apply it more often from there, depending on what your derma says and how bad your acne is.

It‚Äôll make you super sensitive to sun exposure too, so I suggest you use it at night. Always wear sunscreen!!

Make sure to moisturise on top or else it‚Äôll dry your skin out. You can wait 5 mins or so after application of tretinoin to add moisturiser next. If you can‚Äôt handle it though, you can just wash it off afterwards so at least you get some benefits from it.

I‚Äôve read you‚Äôre not supposed to use it in conjunction with salicylic acid, so if you have that in your routine, maybe alternate the uses.

Stuff like this will put your skin through a phase called purging. That means you might probably get pimples using it, but that‚Äôs bc the retinoids are telling the old layers of your skin to ‚Äòdie‚Äô faster so newer skin can surface. This means that pimples might come with it.

It shouldn‚Äôt last a few weeks or months‚Äî if it does, though, it might mean you had a reaction to it. Discontinue use and consult your derma if this happens.

Brand: NuDerm Dermage. I got it from Dermclinic.

Skin type: sensitive/combination </TEXT>

<TEXT> This year tbh. I just feel really isolated and I don‚Äôt feel any ‚ÄòChristmas Spirit‚Äô at all. Not sure if I even believe in God anymore. It‚Äôd suck if I didn‚Äôt.

There was 0 effort put into all this, and I was the only one that bothered to get gifts. My mom didn‚Äôt get anything for me this year bc she already gave birth to me (ok but i never asked to be born) and buys me small things throughout the year, but she made sure to get gifts for her best friend‚Äôs family and a new Samsung tablet for my brother.

The food was really mediocre. I ate sandwiches the entire time and when I wasn‚Äôt eating the same 2 types of sandwiches (ham and peanut butter), I was eating bland, oily tuna pasta.

Doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôve been sick the past few weeks. The depression isn‚Äôt helping. I wanna get hit by a car this Christmas season.

But hey! You guys are probably having a better time than I am. Merry Christmas, y‚Äôall. </TEXT>

<TEXT> unpopular opinion time:

i'm not really fond of the content most of the influencers here make. their editing style is just not my taste. when they have those laughing sound effects or make their voice high-pitched, i think it's corny. it's hard for me to sit through it.

i find it confusing when influencers go to any place, buy a bunch of stuff, and automatically, it's titled as "\_\_\_\_ HAUL!!!!". I've even seen *grocery* hauls. almost every look is warm-toned, natural and *safe*. i get that it's nice to have something to watch for wearable looks, but it's starting to look the same.

though!!! some influencers whose work i enjoy are anna trinidad, bretman rock, and rachel tee tyler (half-fil/aussie)

EDIT: i used to watch edward avila, but now i'm not that interested in his content now that i've seen him defend skin bleaching and colourism. skin bleaching is not the equivalent of tanning.

dislike michelle dy bc she seems kinda shady and i didn't like that she made that JS situation as something to be glorified. </TEXT>

<TEXT> sure! :D you can use different types of face oils to address various skin concerns, such as acne marks, or dryness/flakiness, dullness, or for hyperpigmentation, etc. it helps to use face oil before applying foundation, because i found that the foundation doesn't stick to the dry patches on my face, and gives me a natural, dewy glow. it's also easier for me, personally, in application, since i tend to use a brush.

it definitely helps to do research on what your skin needs. some people think that adding oil would just make your skin break out, but face oil actually does the opposite by locking in the moisture your face needs. the right one shouldn't clog your pores either.

i'm using Ayele & Co.'s [Sunflower Sweets Serum](https://ayele.co/products/sunflower-sweets-serum), which helped lighten acne marks and smoothen my skin texture. i sometimes use the serums from [Cleopatra's Secret](https://www.instagram.com/cleopatrassecretph/?hl=en) as well, which is a local brand.

i only recently started using face oil since my combination skin was starting to develop painful, dry patches on my cheeks due to the lack of humidity in my office. because my skin was irritated, it was prone to breaking out more often. using a face oil helped me balance things out again :D

hope this helped! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Since I‚Äôm part-Thai/Chinese/Filipino, I can see a group like this coming from these countries. Esp for Thailand and China since there are already Thai and Chinese people who are idols in Korea.

The culture I‚Äôm most connected with is my Thai heritage, since it‚Äôs also shaped me to be the person I‚Äôve become. If I saw a traditional dance or something containing elements of Thai music, something I do actively look for, I think I‚Äôd feel very proud.

Edit: found a [compilation](https://youtu.be/9oZllwytreU)  of Thai idols dancing to Thai party music here üòÇ </TEXT>

<TEXT> Bc they make me laugh and smile‚Äî something at one point I hadn‚Äôt been able to do on my own. For me, watching Markiplier‚Äôs videos cheered me up a lot. And I‚Äôve developed habits around it, like doing my makeup while watching a let‚Äôs play, or listening to his voice while working, or getting ready for the day. It‚Äôs kinda therapeutic for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I run to their music (yes, including Run lol) on the treadmill bc I find it to be so energising and upbeat!! I can spend up to an hour just running to their music. When I use any weight machines I tend to listen to the Cypher series or any of the rap line‚Äôs songs.

Recently I got into the swing of trying to learn at *least* Pied Piper‚Äôs dance, bc it seems so fun to dance. üòÇ BTS played a huge part in me finally getting out of that rut I was in, bc it finally got me on my feet and looking for ways to care for my own health, both physically and mentally.

Anpanman + Mic Drop + Fake Love + Go Go are my personal favourites I always make sure to listen to while working out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Pigmented means it has good colour payoff (i.e., a blush with poor pigment would end up looking sheer, so layering it to get some decent coverage might disrupt the foundation underneath)

plus if a blush is pigmented, u can just tap off the excess so it‚Äôs not hard to blend out :D  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! :D i have both. For the highlighter, it‚Äôs really beautiful for that wet look, but sometimes i just feel like it needs a bit more *oomph*, so i usually use it on top of another highlighter.

Ur gonna look so sparkly in the daylight :D

Sometimes i do feel like it‚Äôs just glitter though

I find it applies best using their cheek hugging highlight brush since if i use my fingers, it‚Äôs just gonna be stuck there lol </TEXT>

<TEXT> Recommendations for blush: j.cat beauty! Super pigmented at a good price. + peri-pera airy ink velvet (u can find it at beauty by freyja in glorietta)

eyeshadow palette: pink sugar palette :D they‚Äôre good esp if you‚Äôre starting out. if you can go to a tupped boutique, get her a Morphe palette with warm or nude shades. you can also get her a palette from Sleek makeup.

Lipsticks: imo the lipsticks from MAC r kinda drying and stiff so maybe you can get her either a tint or a liquid lipstick.

*splurge*: Bobbi Brown nude lipsticks (Blondie pink) or NARS lip pencil (Dolce vita)

*steal*: NYX matte lip cream (stockholm/cannes) / Careline kiss stick in Vacay (P99) / Maybelline The Powder Mattes (toasted brown + touch of spice)

you can also use the airy ink velvet on lips! for a soft diffused look

DEFINITELY recommend you buying the small set of blushes n bronzers from Benefit. had small travel sizes of their blushers n 2 of their Hoola bronzers, for P1500 at freyja! They also have it at benefit.

this is coming from a makeup enthusiast who also has fair skin :3 hope this helps! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lip gloss and overlining with lip liner could help! For lip liner, try to follow your natural edges when drawing into the corners of your mouth, and slightly round it out as you follow the bow of ur lips.

You can also use liquid lipstick and diffuse the edges so it looks like you have poutier lips. You can use your finger for this, or a round eyeshadow blending brush. Then add a bit of highlight just on your cupid‚Äôs bow. :D hope these help! </TEXT>

<TEXT> after all this, what was the point u were getting at? hasty generalisation isn't a good way to go about things, especially when u say things like:

>the shoppers are *always*...

and:

>while the workers who serve and wait on them *tend to be*...

yes, there are different socio-economic classes, but that doesn't mean microaggressions are being perpetuated here. perhaps u meant it from a nationalistic standpoint, but from the way you've written it, it just seems like ur looking down on both sides of the fence my dude </TEXT>

Every time I feel the urge to just BUY something for the sake of buying it, I tell myself ‚ÄúStop!!! U don‚Äôt need it!!!‚Äù And my mind would instantly come up with other (better) dupes i have at home waiting for me

I‚Äôve been trying to use more of the products I have too bc i don‚Äôt want them to just go to waste

I‚Äôm tempted to buy the blush from hourglass (ambient lighting) next, and the black liquid lipstick + new gloss bomb from fenty beauty. Trying to talk myself out of it constantly bc i don‚Äôt really have money for it rn haha </TEXT>

<TEXT> what kind of moisturiser should i use to get rid of dry patches? i have combi skin, but humidity in my office causes my skin to dry out really easily. i moisturise with sunflower oil at morning and night, but i think i need something more moisturising. also, how do you know if your skin is supposed to be exfoliated or if it's supposed to be treated carefully bc if you exfoliate, it might aggravate dry and sensitive skin? </TEXT>

<TEXT> my makeup tends to stay throughout the day, so maybe my foundation routine might help!

* moisturise with bahi sunflower sweets serum + mario badescu rose water spray bc it's humid in my office (i don't often use silicone-based primers bc it tends to create unwanted texture on my skin)
* i followed one of hindash's [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLfpAImkNtg&t=203s) and take a foundation brush (not a paddle type) and use 1-2 pumps of maybelline super stay 24-hr foundie and slowly work it into my skin with a thin layer, so it doesn't cake up (if it does, i just go over it with a damp sponge to blend it out)
* i go over with cream contour (nyx wonder stick) and concealer (under the eyebags so it won't crease, and in small amounts), and once that's done, i take an angled stippling brush or a fluffy powder brush and use either maybelline stay fresh pressed powder or ellana cosmetics loose mineral foundation powder to buff it into my skin, using upwards strokes, so it'll fill in my pores and set the foundation/concealer
* i set in between doing my makeup with mario badescu rose water spray before i continue doing my eyes </TEXT>

<TEXT> not part of the masks or FL intro, but right before J-Hope began dancing to the intro for IDOL, I noticed the red and blue splashes of water and instantly thought of J-Hope and Jimin dancing to the intro for [Boy Meets Evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoLdj46UajI) at the 2016 MAMAs

seeing comments about Joon's Not Today hair, Tae's Save Me hair, and possibly Jimin's BST hair, I think there's an additional reference to the WINGS era with the intro for IDOL

with their FL intro, I remember their concept photos and this is those photos brought to life. I remember seeing a post before about Jin's $ shirt during this year's MGAs being a call-out to people trying to use them, and how in their concept photos, the ribbons around them make them look like puppets

maybe the masks are the fa√ßade they keep up in front of everyone while the real them is bound to the confines of their boxes (maybe a metaphor for how their movements are limited when everyone's eyes are on them? kinda like how [DKDKTV talks about it](https://youtu.be/vQkRkxW7OBE?t=2418) \["trapped in a cage"\]) and with loving themselves (what they see in the mirror + IDOL lyrics "There are tens and hundreds of myself in me"), they'll be able to show who they really are and maybe who they are behind the mask and who they are with it come to meet as one </TEXT>

<TEXT> The first time I watched BTS, it was their performance at the AMAs with DNA back in 2017. I already knew about them from my mutuals on twitter, who were all ARMY.

And tbh I don‚Äôt know why, but when I saw them performing, I felt like crying. Not sad tears, no; but the type you feel when you‚Äôre overwhelmed with emotions.

I just felt so much love and positivity from their fans and watching them perform. And when I became an ARMY, they kept on proving to me over and over that all the emotion and passion is still there and that it‚Äôs never left. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm a fresh grad and I only started working this July. I don't make nearly as much as my mom does, but I understand her job's been really taxing on her, especially dealing with mistreatment from her managers. She won't collect her salary or resign anymore, nor will she wait for them to terminate her. Are there any legal consequences or obligations I need to anticipate, like in contracts, and such? I'm also worried about the potential fallout from this, especially if she were to get a new job. Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you! </TEXT>
