<TEXT> Ngl, I am 100% intending to wear cowboy boots at my wedding (postponed to 2022). But we’re getting married at a rustic, outdoor venue and literally 5 people’s response to hearing I was engaged was “omg you need to wear cowboy boots!” because I love mine and I generally have quite a quirky sense of style. All that said, they will not be blue 😂 </TEXT>

<TEXT> We were the same with our reactive dog. The Midnight Club was killing me and when we finally managed to snag an appointment with a veterinary behaviourist she literally said “you do more than enough at home - he doesn’t need walks”. All that being said, for normal and healthy dogs it always amazes me how little walking makes a big difference - obviously, a good long walk is better than a short one but a 15min sniffy walk twice a day is enough to make a BIG difference in a lot of dogs lives. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ditto. I mean, I often give the last of the food to my partner and then I go without because it felt like I had to. One day it just got to me that I was doing that and he wasn’t “giving” anything in return so I just told him and he had zero idea that that was happening. Now he’s more aware and tries to make more of an effort to see that I’m not doing it too often and makes sure to show me that it’s not something I need to be doing. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I genuinely hate how this sentiment has come to be used. Yes, relationships take work. But love? Nope. Love does not. When we say “relationships take work”, that should mean “relationships take compromise, empathy, having difficult and honest conversations, working together to solve problems”. It should by no means, ever mean “it takes work to look at your partner and feel love for them”. Sure, in the middle of an argument or a major bout of frustration you might not feel that love and I’m not saying you need to feel the swooning, puppy love every single moment of every single day but “I don’t know if I love my partner and I haven’t for a long time” should not be what we mean when we say “relationships take work”. For the OP, the first question should be “do you love your partner?”. If the answer is no, then the question is “not right now, or not at all? Do you think you can love them again?” And work from there. If the answer is “yes, I love my partner”, then the question is “is that enough to work on finding the connection and fulfillment you need from this relationship?”.

ETA: apologies, I responded to the wrong comment! The feeling stands though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA. I have 2 dogs and 2 cats. Before I spoke to my friends and asked them if they could take the responsibility of doing what they felt was right for the pets, we took out a life insurance policy that would cover the costs of keeping them (including the additional costs for rent because said friends would need a bigger yard) for a year. This would give them time to find the pets good homes, if that’s what they decided to do. This is for PETS (granted, they’re my life and I don’t have kids). Taking care of living things is expensive and if you can’t plan for it, even more so. They should have thought of this themselves. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I’d start with building focus, to be honest. Train a really solid “look at me” before you do anything else - you’re going to struggle to communicate if your dog doesn’t focus on you when you need him to. Then introduce some orientation games so that your dog learns to check in with you after being distracted. I’d also probably start with clicker training - for dogs that struggle to focus and pick up on things, timing and instant gratification can be doubly important and the clicker helps you get those things. Lastly, figure out what genuinely motivates him. Is it food? Play? Being able to explore? Leverage that for the training. If he’s not willing to work for any of those things, you’ll have to work on building his drive (not free feeding, for example).

Edit to add: as others have said, it’s never too late to start training! You just need to work out where your communication is breaking down and take it from there. Work with the dog in front of you and figure out how he learns. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Agree with most of the above too. As someone who’s owned a reactive dog who literally became that way after another dog attack, I think I’d add a few things: I would muzzle train your pup. 90% for your peace of mind and 10% for him. Truth is, you don’t know what happened or why and one incident isn’t enough data to figure out his triggers but you definitely want to avoid it being more than one incident. This isn’t to say that you should always have your dog muzzled. It’s just to say that, once you’ve done some play dates with dogs he knows or are ready to go back to the dog park or whatever the case is, you have the option of muzzling him if you’re nervous or you’re not 100% sure how things will go. Second thing is the tough one (or was for me, after my dogs first - and only - bite). I was so terrified it would happen again that I was too scared to give him the chance to interact with people. Don’t do this because he’ll never learn and you’ll never know if he’s ok. Instead, try and find the balance between good, positive interactions and too much risk. But definitely try and get those positive interactions where and how you can and when you’re confident they’ll go well. I’m sorry this happened but you’re already ahead of 90% of dog owners by taking responsibility and by asking what to do. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I received the advice to start with safety and then go “top down, most used to least used”. There’s no point fixing your floor if your roof is leaking (hyperbolic, I know but it makes the point I think). We’ve been trying to follow that advice as best we can, while accounting for limitations from future protects. I love gardening but we plan on building so it’s a waste of time and money to start a great garden that’ll be destroyed when the building happens. So I chose a small part of the garden that’s least likely to be affected and started there. For the house itself, we started with moving the interior walls and then the kitchen renno and then we’re moving to the master bedroom. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Enforced naps. That’s literally the only tip I can give you. Start from scratch with the training, be consistent and do enforced naps and then hope your sanity survives. We’ve JUST been through this and it is TOUGH. If there are high-arousal places and states, try avoiding those. We shifted from walks where we passed people and other dogs to 2/3rds of his walks just being sniffing and digging on a field to keep arousal levels down and moved from feeding in a wobbler to feeding using a snuffle mat or rolled up blanket to give him something to decompress after a walk.

Good luck and hang in there, it does pass! </TEXT>

<TEXT> We do the run away thing to get her to chase us but didn’t think about stopping and treating where she’d dropped the ball! Did you have to start with treating as soon as she reached it? I think some combination of this and “take it” will help.

We were meant to have “leave it” and “drop it” as two different things but my fiancé keeps on using them in the wrong way so now they’re basically interchangeable 🙈 I have a “get it” command so if I say leave it and never say “get it”, they’ll leave it for good, although it might be a good idea to push for the two different ones cause I think that does cause some anticipation anxiety. Thanks for pointing it out! Helpful to have the reminder to get us humans out of our bad habits! </TEXT>

<TITLE> Teaching fetch? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-09-30 10:01:08 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hello!

I have a 9wo BC pup and (obviously) want to teach her fetch. So far, I’ve been focusing on teaching “leave it” and she’s cottoned on quick. Her recall still needs a ton of work (I’ve never met such an independent pup before!). She’s more food than play motivated but still loves to play and will engage with toys readily, just has more focus with food.

I’ve started rolling a ball for her or tossing her toys a very short distance to try and get her to bring it back to start teaching the basic principles of fetch early on. The problem I’m having is: she’ll chase after the toy, play with it for a second and then run back to me without it. This isn’t a problem I’ve encountered before: my first dog I had the battle of him playing keep away once he had the ball and my second won’t chase it at all (which is fine, he enjoys different games and we’ve figured those out now).

How do I get her to pick up the ball/toy in the first place? The only thing I can think of is training a “take it” but I’m not clear on how to transition that to a throw/toss/roll (I.e. how to do “take it” at distance and then still get her to bring it back?).

If anyone has any ideas on how to train this or has been through this themselves, would love to hear how you solved it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the thick of this! We hired a contractor to move the walls and will do the same for the tiles but we’re building the cabinets ourselves because my SO has a very specific idea of how he wants them done.

Best thing we did? Took out the existing cabinets and build a “mockup” kitchen with what we had lying around the house. It looks frikken awful but we’ve been using the kitchen as it will be for a month now and noticed a few things that needed to be changed from our original plan that makes it prettier and more usable. I am SO glad we did this because I both get a more usable kitchen in the interim and we identified expensive changes before we had to make them.

Also: the kitchen triangle. There’s great advice online if you google it but definitely google it and use it. It’s gold. </TEXT>

- 1 drawer at the bottom with “cubby holes” for shoes
- 2 drawera above for things that can’t be hung up
- 3 hanging rails

This is across a 2-door closet and basically I’ve found that hanging things up is the best solution. If I could hang everything up, I would but, alas, some things are just not hang-able. And then a “laundry in” and “laundry out” basket and I pack away clothes from the “laundry in” basket in like 5-10min intervals throughout my day/week because I frikken hate it and generally procrastinate like crazy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> You’ve received a ton of comments, I know, but also want to chime in with our experience: we’ve had two pups at 6 weeks, both rescues who’s mothers and siblings didn’t make it or were too sick to keep them together, based on the vets’ assessment.

Our cocker was a perfectly average puppy and completely normal adult dog. He’s having some minor issues with leash reactivity and separation anxiety but both of these only started when our 6-month-long lockdown was lifted.

Our border collie arrived home two weeks ago, so she’s 8 weeks now. Honestly, she’s the best pup I’ve ever met. She basically house trained herself and, aside from being VERY clingy the first three days, is angelic. Obviously, I have no idea what she’ll be like when she’s older but just be extra aware of the potential problems and prepare for more play biting that an older pup. Chances are, raised right and with you being careful, your little one will be just fine. </TEXT>

That might be because they're both still young and never off leash though. Sounds like a generally cool idea though!

ETA: good luck with the project!

I want to talk to you about some of the things I've been thinking and feeling but I also want to make it clear that this conversation is 100% about you. I have been incredibly happy with you since we got back together and you are the person I want to be with in the long term. That said, I've been feeling really curious about some aspects of my sexuality that I haven't really had the opportunity to explore and I wanted to talk to you about the possibility of opening up our relationship.


I want you to know that this has nothing to do with being unsatisfied in this relationship - sexually or otherwise - and is primarily the want to explore with you and with others. My goal with this conversation is, first, to hear if this is something you would be open to and, if it is, for me to hear what sorts of rules and boundaries you would want to put in place. I want to be completely open and honest with you so if you have any questions, please ask them. I also want you to know that if this is not something you would be comfortable with, you are still the person that I want to be with and then this will not be something that I pursue or push for in any way. I will only consider it if it is something we are both happy to introduce into our relationship, with boundaries that make sure we are both comfortable."


Also: peeps, let others live their lives. Your relationship - or idea of a relationship - has exactly zero bearing on the relationships of other people. Monogamy is not the only way to be happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Depending on what I was doing with my dog, yes to all (with some questions).

If I was taking my dog to a lot of big spaces where they could run off leash or doing SAR, that sounds very very useful but, realistically, I won’t be able to let my cocker off leash ever because of his nose. My collie is only 8 weeks old now so I don’t know what I plan on doing with her yet 😂

The speaking to and recording aspect sounds useful for a number of reasons: being able to give verbal cues from large distances, getting info from people being rescued and being able to hear what strangers are saying/doing to my dog in odd circumstances (I’m imagining my cat at the moment, who my neighbors tried to steal by feeding it wet food it isn’t supposed to have but I’m struggling to imagine a similar context for my dogs).

Questions:
data privacy from the recordings and audio - where is that stored? How is it used? Etc etc.
Legality: I’m not sure it’s even legal for you to record people without their knowledge in my country and this would definitely do that.

Phone SIM wouldn’t bother me at all but cost likely would. As it stands now, I haven’t paid the extra expense of having a GPS tracker on my dog, although I’ll reconsider if where we take them and what they do changes. Personally, I can’t see myself making the payment and my brain immediately assumed it would be prohibitively expensive. But if I was doing a lot of the things described above, I’d probably consider it equipment and then do it.

Hope that’s helpful! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just want to add to this very solid list of suggestions. One of the things that helped us was the “flitting game”. Set a timer for 5mins and choose 2 adjacent rooms and a time where your pup is already fairly calm. We actually started with our open plan lounge and kitchen cause our pup was that bad (as opposed to rooms where you go through a doorway). Start in room 1 with your pup and just fiddle until the pup settles down somewhere in the room with you. Once the pup settles, move to the next room and just fiddle until they settle down again. Repeat for 5 mins. It took about 3 times for our pup to stay settled but lift his head when we moved between rooms. Another 2 or 3 for him to not even look up. Then we started moving through doorways. Less than a week and pup would stay settled in room 1 while we moved to room 2 for the full 5mins. Don’t push it longer than that else the pup might become anxious or frustrated and make some changes if it does seem that the pup is anxious with the exercise. But the theory is: pup has the option to follow you but eventually learns that that’s boring and kinda annoying so they choose not to.

ETA: this isn’t the solution to separation anxiety or isolation distress but one exercise that you can add to help pup get used to being alone. Please don’t do only this - it’ll take other things too. And also: good luck! Separation anxiety SUCKS and I hope you guys and pup get through the other side! </TEXT>

I think the things that were helpful for me to know when trying to decide if I’d go ahead with it or not were (a) that if you train it right, your pup will probably choose it’s crate and (b) if it goes to the vet for any length of time, it will be crated so it may as well learn that it doesn’t have to panic in there.

I do the same as the comment about - used just the crate attached to the play pen until about 6months old and then I had the crate in the bedroom for night time or enforced naps and a “proper” dog bed in the lounge. Pup has just passed the 11month mark and we seem to have passed the bulk of adolescence so he’s now graduated to his “big boy” bed and harness. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We had this exact same problem. What we did to manage it was have two harnesses - one we would put on in the morning and leave on all day for walks and do our best to deal with the biting. The other we never put on unless he was calm and we used treats to lure his head through and slowly move to putting his leg through, buckling it etc etc. We happened to have two harnesses that were different styles (first one my hubby bought wasn’t a style I like so we replaced it but had this issue) and I figured it couldn’t hurt to have the negative association only happen with the harness we weren’t planning on using long term. We also couldn’t avoid walks entirely while we trained the harness so this was our best plan. Took about 3 weeks and now he sits nicely for his harness and has zero issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sending strongs! We have that problem with separation anxiety (cocker spaniel and all. Probably my favorite expression in dog training is “work with the dog in front of you”. Genetic issues and predispositions can really suck and knowing things will be a lifelong battle or just “thing to be aware of” is hard. But at the same time, I just keep seeing how much easier it is with a healthy, well socialized, “neurotypical” dog. You’ll find your groove and it’ll become second nature and then things will feel easier, I think. </TEXT>

<TEXT> No idea if this will be helpful to anyone or not but it was an epiphany I had this evening. My last dog was reactive and aggressive. Turned out to be a tumor causing it and we had euthanize him. We were devastated but we also knew we could never go through that reactivity again - I still can’t take a walk without being an anxious mess because I’m on high alert all the time. We currently have an 11mo pup who we got from a good breeder at 8 weeks. We did all the puppy socialization things and then our country went into full lockdown and for SIX. MONTHS. He couldn’t interact with a single other human or dog. We were literally not even allowed walking our dogs in my country.

On Sunday, we tried to do an intro between him and a friends pup (All the right things - neutral location, walking parallel, short sniffs when they were both calm etc etc). It did NOT go well and my brain spiraled, thinking we had another reactive dog on our hands. We had a session with the same pup and our trainer today and things improved so much already. Her verdict is he’s just a little unsure of other dogs and some more (positive) exposure will have him right as rain.

What all of this really brought home for me is how unlucky or how bad a dogs first few months needs to be before they have real issues. Sure, there are dogs that develop behavioural issues because of one bad incident or genetics or the training was done wrong but for most dogs, that’s just not true.

Lesson being: you can make mistakes. Most likely, your dog will be just fine, it just may mean a little more work on something down the line. But there’s basically always going to be work down the line because none of us can raise a puppy perfectly and no dog is going to have absolutely zero issues, ever.

Anyways. That realization made me feel better about a lot of things and I feel like I can relax and actually do the work now because I’m not constantly afraid of making mistakes and permanently “ruining” my dog. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I was recently diagnosed with ADHD along with my CPTSD and I think the ADHD only explains some of this (in that, my ADHD symptoms drastically improved on meds except for this one). In my experience, the cause of the drop in interest is whenever it gets to the point at which I go “hey, I could be good at this!” Or “this could be a real thing!”. I suspect it’s a fear-response to potential failure combined with being afraid of being at any “center of attention” (not the right wording but - drawing attention to myself?).

One of the things I found that helped was the exercise “what would your life look like in 5 years if you knew you wouldn’t fail?”. I wrote out every aspect of my week in this make-believe life (like, Monday I would write out what a Monday looked like from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed, Tuesday what a Tuesday looked like etc etc). The exercise helped me realize that one of the interests I was currently busy with wasn’t directly related but was the single step I needed to take to make that life come true. If I didn’t take this step, that life would never be possible. So now I’ve managed to stick with it and take some big-ish steps to realizing it. I try and keep the motivation by reading those “diary entries” for the 5-years’-time life every morning and it’s helping so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone with ADHD, this was a BIG problem in my relationship. We solved it by thinking of household tasks differently: we figured out what I’m good at and what he’s good at and split tasks that way. This ended up being that I do “thinking and problem solving” work and he does “make sure things get done” work. So if I see that there are always clothes on the floor, then I try and figure out a solution (in our case, a laundry bin on each side of the bed without a lid on) and he goes to buy them. He does the dishes and he reminds me to put on the laundry when the basket is full because otherwise I would forget but he doesn’t know what should be washed together so it’s more effort for him to actually wash the laundry (or he does it wrong). It took a LOT of pressure off our relationship because neither of us was trying to solve problems we’re bad at solving and we have clear roles and rules - he can come to me and say “this is a problem I’m having with getting things done, can you think about how to make it easier” and I can say to him “there are dirty dishes in the sink, it’s your job to make sure they’re done please can you sort it out”.

Half the battle, in my experience, is finding solutions that actually work for the way you behave. It’s no use saying “just pick the clothes up off the floor” - that’s not something that you ACTUALLY DO so it makes more sense to design a system or layout that makes them never land on the floor in the first place. Anyways, that may help you or it may not but thought it’d be worth sharing because it genuinely made a WORLD of difference in our house. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, this. I don’t have kids but because of childhood trauma our sex life was great for the first three years and then suddenly I just couldn’t do it anymore. I can’t tell you why and I’m working on it but when that became our reality, we sat down and spoke about it. I asked what he would need from me to still be fulfilled in this relationship, he asked what I need from him to move forward on this front. We spoke about worst case scenarios and what that would mean for our relationship. When we hit a wall and stopped making progress, I started seeing a psychologist. Once I’ve made sufficient progress there, we’ll see someone together. We check in every few months or so to ask if anything’s changed - does he need more, do I need something different, what can we do to meet each other’s needs given the current constraints. Not ONCE did he withhold standard affection from me because we’re not having sex. Not once has he used it against me or lauded it over me. Not once has he said he won’t spend time with me if that time is not intimate. What he has said and done is communicating that he’s not feeling loved or he’s missing intimacy. And then we worked out what we could do to help him within the bounds that I am comfortable with. We have a long way to go and it’s a work in progress but after a year of this, he still decided he wanted to marry me and proposed because we’re working on this together.

Granted, this is all possible because sex isn’t something either of us NEEDS to feel connected and secure. But if it is something you need, the way to communicate that is definitely not “give me sex or I will look for it elsewhere” and double definitely not “there’s no point in spending time with you if we’re not having sex”. That’s just gross and cruel and not going to help anyone. </TEXT>

He took to it well but we did get stuck at about the 3min mark where he would start to paw at it and 2 weeks of trying to extend the time got us nowhere. Eventually, I just took him on a walk instead of trying to wait it out. He pawed at the muzzle once and then left it alone and after that could keep it on as long as it was needed. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It’s hard to answer you without a video of Sage doing this behaviour - I would really suggest you contact an animal behaviorist as soon as possible. That said, a few things come to mind:
(1) Sage playing well with other dogs when they also want to play is a really great thing, take heart in that!
(2) if she runs over excitedly and then stops and approaches slowly, she is doing the polite doggy communication at that stage

Those are the good things. The less good things:
(1) the chihuahua owners reaction was awful and unacceptable. I hope it doesn’t but it’s worth you knowing that his reaction may have created some behavioral problems for Sage that she didn’t have before - she may associate other dogs, men or strangers with the violence she experienced and this might make her reactive to any one of those things.
(2) even if Sage is not aggressive, it is your responsibility as an owner to make sure she doesn’t scare other dogs. It does sound like you’ve taken this to heart now but, as the owner of a reactive dog, PLEASE don’t let her off leash unless your recall is 100%.

I’m not a trainer or a behaviourist and I do highly recommend you speak to one buy this would be my course of action:

1. Give her 2-3 days to decompress. No interactions with other dogs or strangers for that time.
2. Only allow her to play with dogs you know she does well with (like her bestie!) in places where she won’t meet other dogs (peoples yards or use SniffSpot to try and find places you can book out)
3. Start working on polite greetings and not getting over-excited by other dogs. This means keeping her on leash (loose, with no tension in the lead) and first being able to walk passed other dogs without having to go say hello. Then work on having her be calm while other dogs come say hello (using a calm, bomb-proof dog for this). Then work on her going to say hello calmly and leaving again. I’d put this on cue (“ok, say hello” and “Sage, let’s go” or something similar) so that not every dog she sees is one she plays with or tries to play with.

Again, I’m not a trainer and I HIGHLY encourage you to contact someone more qualified to talk about it but that would be my strategy. Good luck! You’re a good dog parent and you’re trying you best - you’ll both get there!

<TEXT> My standard is to get my pup in middle immediately (ie sitting between my legs) and then I wait to see what’ll happen. If the dogs slow down/stop, I try cross the street or walk away in a diagonal-ish direction so I don’t turn my back on them but get some calm distance. If they don’t stop then I put my hand out in the “stop” signal and give a pretty firm “no” or stop or whatever and then throw treats on the ground. Once the dogs are somewhat distracted, I tell pup “let’s go” and get him moving away at a calm but quick pace.

Thus far, that’s always worked except for one single case where two off leash pitties attacked my previous dog (no owner in sight). Tbh that was an awful situation and is the reason I basically refuse to let my pup meet off leash dogs I don’t know. But the “middle” and toss treats strategy has mostly worked for me so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This. I’m hella grateful for the crate right now because my pup needs enforced naps at the moment (huge improvements this week though!) but then I only leave him in there until he wakes up on his own (never longer than 2hrs - he’s now 10mo). I’d have ignored crating (which isn’t very popular in South Africa - most of my friends and family are very critical of it but we have awful dog culture) if it weren’t for the potential that he’d need to be in one for medical purposes. The vet even commented that he was the calmest dog she’s seen when he went in for his sterilization and they didn’t need to give him anything for anxiety. Why? Because I sent him in with his blanket, his favorite toy and he was used to being crated.

We also have the situation at home where he guards his sleeping spot against the cats (Newly developed behaviour). Which is a problem when all of the animals sleep on the bed... so now he sleeps in the crate to keep the cats safe because neither him nor the cats will accept sleeping in a different room from us.

I don’t believe crates are inherently cruel, even if dogs aren’t den animals. My trainer always says “it’s not what it is, it’s what you trained it to be”. If the dog isn’t scared, hurt or unhappy (and it should be none of those things if you’ve trained the crate and use it responsibly) then there’s no harm and there are clear use cases where it’s beneficial. All that said, if we no longer NEED the crate, we’d stop closing him in there except on the odd occasion to keep him comfortable with it in case of medical or travel needs. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Never too late to teach her! I’ll hold thumbs for you that it passes quickly - it definitely doesn’t last forever! It may be encouraging to know: we were researching breeds for our next dog with the specific experience of our first in mind. He was reactive and aggressive so we were TERRIFIED about getting another breed that tended to those qualities. What I found was super interesting - a LOT of people who had a-typical dogs, mostly centered around aggression and reactivity, end up going for cockers for their next dog. They’re a solid dog - smart and working dogs but a better off switch than many other working breeds. Loving, cuddly and super people-motivated. They do have a tendency to separation anxiety so be sure to work on that and they can be protective of their owners. I suppose it’s true of many breeds but a lot of people with cockers just never go back - they stick with them forever. Our boy is not intense enough in training for my liking so I’ll likely get a BC but he’s the perfect dog for my husband and I think they’re a great fit for many households. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just been through this with our English cocker boy who is now 10mo. My previous dog was an Aussie cross husky so I thought I was ready for any degree of energy a dog could bring. I was wrong 😂. Something that REALLY helped us: our habits with dogs revolves around walks, fetch and mental stimulation in the form of training, kongs and wobblers. These did NOT work for Senna (the cocker pup). Instead, a snuffle mat and time digging for moles and sniffing FOR something - closer to tracking than just “reading the post” along a walk did a LOT more for him than anything else. Maybe have a look at the type of stimulation you’re giving her and see if it meets her breed requirements? Nowadays, he gets a 20-40min sniffing and digging walk in the morning and then a 40min training walk in the evening, ended off with 10 mins of sniffing and digging again or, if the weather is just too miserable, a game of tug or with the flirt pole (which nicely mimics the “flushing” that the breed was built for). He’s fed a snuffle mat after his walk in the morning and we did enforced naps with frozen hooves throughout the day for about a month (he recently started just chilling on the couch during the day) and dinner is done through trick and mat training while we’re busy in the kitchen (slow process with a “nose” dog). As for the biting: it’s probably not much consolation but the biggest risk with cockers is that they never learn bite inhibition cause they have soft mouths. Her biting is awful now but it’s a good thing for her to learn for when she’s an adult.

Edit: a word. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ours started at 6 months and is slowly tapering off now at 10 months. Not over all of it yet but the worst seems to have passed. All the things you note plus sudden resource guarding and separation anxiety and from loving other dogs to being rude/ mildly aggressive towards them (not exactly aggressive - it seems to be a lack of confidence but working with a trainer on it). The bigger stuff (guarding, SA and dog unfriendliness) has stuck around but he’s getting better at settling again, stopped chewing our shoes, barking has decreased and he’s stopped digging up the yard. Based on his current rate of improvement and training, I estimate another 3-6 months before he’s 100% back to himself. English cocker, for reference. Good luck to you - adolescence is ROUGH. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi all, sorry this is a little (lot) gross.


My question is pretty simple: we bought a fixer-upper and the previous owners apparently allowed cat pee to soak into carpets in two of the rooms in the house. We've pulled up the carpet and I soaked both rooms in bicarb and vinegar (very liberally) and the one room is now rid of the stench. The other? Not so much.


The smell has seeped into the concrete floor and I need to get rid of it before we tile over the concrete. Any tips for getting rid of it? Might be worth noting that the first attempt was in summer and it's winter now - not sure if the fact that it's taking longer to dry might be contributing? </TEXT>

<TEXT> As someone who’s had a reactive dog, I just want to say this: you’ll learn. It’s hard work and I’ve never cried so much in my life but if the things that’s worrying you is not being able to help him, you’ll learn. You’ll get faster, more alert and more ready. You’ll figure out the quiet times to walk him. You’ll work out w protocol or routine for introducing him to things. You’ll learn his signs and thresholds.

It’s not a life for everyone and, if I’m brutally honest, after a year of trying to work with our boy (we literally bought a house just to try and give him the space he needed to expend his energy without encountering triggers so we REALLY tried), and some added medical issues that basically meant he’d always live a life of stress, we decided it wasn’t fair to him or to us. BUT I’m a better dog owner for it. Even now, with a normal, healthy pup, the tricks that came with having a reactive dog are an automatic for me now.

I’d recommend seeing a Behaviourist and getting an honest, clear idea of what life with this guy would look like. Rather than decided based on feeling like you’re not good enough right now, decide based on if that life is one you’re ok living. If it is, you’ll get better at the rest of it. If it isn’t, there is nothing in the world wrong with that either. Pup will be happier with someone who can give them that and there’s zero shame in that person not being you.

Go read up about counter conditioning and desensitization but, most importantly, about trigger stacking and figure out a protocol for when pup needs decompress days (there will be many of them!) and then fine communities that can give you help and support cause it’s exhausting but, for many people, very worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Still not. Cultural appropriation includes the fact that a white person with a stereotypically black name will not face the same discrimination that a black person with that name would.

It does not imply inherently negative sentiments or associations. A lot of the point in the conversation around it isn’t “you’re mocking my culture”, it’s “you’re belittling the seriousness of racism by taking this aspect of my culture when you will not be mocked/hindered by it and yet I am”.

In that sense, naming a white kid a stereotypically black name IS cultural appropriation because, while she might get teased for it a little (also not ok and icky of the dad to do that to her), she’s not going to lose a stack of opportunities in life because of her name and a black kid with the same name would (as pointed out by one of the commenters below). </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yes! Sorry, it's a standard name among my dog training circle. It's getting the dog to sit or lie between your legs while you're standing. I use it when we come across other dogs or people or if we're in a training class and I need to listen to the instructor. It's useful to get your dog somewhere "safe" if another dog is approaching, especially off leash or one you don't know. And in high-distraction environments, it seems to work better than a simple settle or sit at your side - you'll see a lot of agility handlers have their dogs in middle before they start a run because it both focuses the dog and gets them in place. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The entire premise of the BDSM community is active, ongoing consent. As someone with past traumas as well, one of you is gonna have to give: she can either commit to being ok with how things are now and you can try/hope that you get more comfortable or she can’t. If it’s a deal-breaker for her, it’s a deal-breaker for you: you can’t be 100% sure that you can get comfortable with this and it’s not a risk worth taking, imo, to risk your own career and future for a relationship that has a high probability of ending down the line anyway. Deal breakers for either party can only be evaluated in the “right now”, you can’t hope that something is going to change. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It’s a pretty big thing in the ADHD community to acknowledge that some of the effects are basically superpowers. Hyperfocus, energy and excitement, knowing a little about lots of topics because of ever-changing interests, creativity... all of these are some of the positive effects of ADHD. “Proud” isn’t a word that I’m used to people using but that might be where the sentiment is coming from.

OP, you’re NTA but I’d bear in mind that sometimes people are just trying to look out for you and might mean well. I’m heading on 30 and if I don’t take my meds I literally can’t function and if my anxiety is particularly high or my focus particularly bad, my fiancé will ask (kindly) if I’ve taken my meds that day. It may be worth talking to your family about how you feel and when and how they can check in about your meds - maybe express that fidgety and hyper aren’t things that make you feel bad but if you’re struggling with X (in my case, anxiety) then you understand why they ask. </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> For the past three years (although probably much longer), I have tried and failed to set up a morning and evening routine. Like, miserably.


Three months ago, I was diagnosed and given stimulants and, last night, I realized that I've managed to chain together a morning routine of six components! SIX! They're all tiny, of course, but guys.... I have a routine in the mornings. As soon as my partner leaves to walk the dog, I take my meds, make the bed, open the curtains in the bedroom and house (which I actually remembered to close the night before), feed the cats, sort out the dogs food for the day, pack lunch for us, defrost something for dinner and then sit and draw/paint/journal for 15mins to half an hour.


For the past month or so, I've had this thought pop into my head every evening about exercise... like, every night I think to myself "I should start exercising tomorrow. Nothing big, 5 sit ups is good enough to get started". Today, I did my first set of 5 sit ups because yesterday I decided when and where I was going to do them. For around a year, I've been trying to cut sugar from my coffee and I always just give up after like 2 cups of not enjoying it. A little over a week ago, I accidentally drank my partners' coffee and he doesn't take sugar. I didn't even notice so now I've had sugarless coffee for a week. I've actually used my bullet journal daily for the past three months and just finished a notebook for the first time in my entire life.


They're such tiny things but they were SO HARD before. It's been this ongoing battle just to get the tiny things right, my whole life, and suddenly they're possible. I don't know how I managed to battle through life when even this small stuff was so difficult before and I'm just so grateful and happy that I'm finally getting the treatment I need and that it makes such a difference.


End of happy rant. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Cement screed vs tiles - thoughts? </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-07-25 18:15:13 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi redditors! I'm hoping this is the right sub for this but I'd like advice/thoughts....


We're in the process of renovating and expanding our home. We moved in a year ago and the place was/is a bit of a wreck. We're hoping to refinance our bond for the full value of the home in a few months time to gather together the money to complete the more expensive additions. Before we do this, we have some smaller projects we need to finish up.


One of those is redoing the flooring in the house. At present, it's an absurd mix of very old and damaged laminate flooring, while tiles in the kitchen, brown tiles in the passage and gross yellow tiles in the bedroom. The study and guest room are currently just the original concrete floor - they were carpeted but cat pee soaked in so far that a year of soaking the floors in vinegar, bicarb and hot water has only just got the smell out. Anyways. On to the main debate:


My partner and I both love the look of concrete screed flooring. We are considering redoing all the flooring throughout the house this way, starting with the areas that need to be redone urgently. Another option is to do tiles which basically look like cement. The price difference is small - if I convert currencies then the screed is about USD100 more expensive than the medium priced tiles and USD100 less expensive than the most expensive tiles. If we tile, we have a quote for someone to come in and do it for us and the price is decent. We're waiting on a quote to do the screeding, but are tempted to try and do it ourselves.


But I'm torn. I simply don't know the risks of the screed well enough to know if it's worth it to spend an extra USD100 on something I want LESS but that may hold up better. Anyone have any experience with screed flooring? Anything that we should know about or take into consideration? The only real things that come up if you do some research is cracking and the fact that it's cold (we do have very variable weather here - hot summers and decently cold winters, around 6 degrees Celsius). But I'm not sure if cracking means "fine cracks no one will notice" or "your floor looks like the entrance to another dimension". Help a gal out with info, advice and experience before I turn myself into knots trying to decide? TIA

Edit: By screed flooring, I mean a thin layer of polished and sealed concrete. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, we treat every time if we can. It’s just not worth the risk of losing recall for me if we don’t. We bake homemade liver bread for most of our training and if we don’t have then it’s a big fuss and play. Nowadays he recalls if we don’t have a treat and then we just go to the kitchen and grab one. As for the training: when he was your pups age, we played “tennis” where we would call him between the two of us and treat. Made that gradually harder by hiding, going outside, etc. Then we just started recalling when he wasn’t distracted on walks and now I recall him frequently on walks to keep it strong. I use “this way” when I think he’s less likely to come and reserve the recall for when I’m 90% sure he’ll come to me. If he doesn’t, then I keep him close for a while and do a series of easier recalls before testing it “in the wild” again. Oh! We also have a 10m long line that we use outside so he’s never actually run away from us, even if there are more interesting things around him </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA. And this from someone who did check out during a friendship after trying to be there for the person and then my mental health couldn’t handle it anymore. Then I went through something awful and she wasn’t there for me either (understandably) and then, months later, we had a brief chat and the friendship is back on the go but it looks very different. Frankly speaking, over-reliance on a friend for support is not healthy and there need to be boundaries - you have every right to never speak to him again but, if you ever did, I’d strongly suggest trying to adjust the nature of this friendship because the way it is now is clearly hurting you. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Yeah, I think there’s also a weird mindset around weddings that I don’t always realize people have. Like the wedding is limited by budget and nothing else so the second something is postponed or another cost drops away then the money “should” go to the wedding. When we told people we were postponing, everyone was like “oh more time to save then!”  Like? No, I don’t need a bigger, fancier wedding than the wedding I planned, budgeted and saved for. Any extra money can go to my bond, thank you very much. And now I realize I’m venting because of all the people who are pushing me to go big because we have more time and not actually being relevant to the post.... short version: people need to chill. Save for the wedding you want or get the wedding you can afford, stop trying to get other people to buy you shit to make up for your lack of planning and stop assuming that more time and money HAVE to equal bigger weddings, you were happy with your plan before. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lol. All. The. Damn. Time. My favorite is “it’s a dog, not a kid” when we’re not willing to leave our pup who’s developing separation anxiety at home alone. And “you’re going to have a fat dog with all that bribery” about using treats to train him (from people who have jack russels that weigh more than my husky-Aussie cross and eat more in a single meal than he does in a day). My mum thinks it’s cruel to leave the dog inside when we go to work (pre-covid and separation anxiety), never mind that dog theft is a big problem in our area. And a looooot of comments on the crate, which are not used much at all in South Africa (I’d never even heard of the concept until a friend from the UK told me about it, tbh). Oh! And plenty of “how could you”s when we muzzle trained our reactive dog so that he could actually go on walks safely. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, my wedding WAS set for 2021 and we made the call to postpone it because I don’t know if our country borders will be open yet. I bought my dress in December LAST YEAR because I fell in love when I was just doing “for fun” dress shopping with my sister and there was a 50% sale on the dress. Was I a little sad about postponing? Sure. I want to marry the love of my life. Did I throw a hissy fit and upgrade my expectations? No. Because it’s just a damn wedding. And there are exactly two things that are important about it: I get to celebrate my relationship with the man I love and my friends and family have an absolute BLAST. End of. I’m so blooming annoyed at everyone acting like they’ve been robbed of something because of this (minus the people who legit didn’t have warning and had to cancel weddings they’d completely planned at the last minute cause they did lose something and that would suck so much but, by now, everyone should have seen this coming). </TEXT>

Learn what to look for and how to read your dog so you know what’s working and what isn’t and then, when you’ve learned everything you can, be prepared to be flexible and change every plan you ever made it they just happen to not work for the dog you get. As long as you’re willing to do the work and know that what that looks like might change or be different from what you expected, you’ll do great. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Defs didn't mean to imply that preparation isn't important - 100%, it is! And it's great you were prepared for what your dogs gave you - I wasn't and none of the dog owners I know, even the really great and very experienced dog owners, were. None of us were absolutely, 100% prepared for what that specific dog was going to be like. That's literally impossible because no two dogs are the same. All I really meant to say was: being prepared is better than not, but being unprepared isn't the worst thing a new dog owner can be. The worst thing they can be is unwilling to change their behaviour to meet the needs of the dog that they have. I've had friends get dogs they shouldn't have gotten because the breed is a bad fit but they've phoned and asked "what do we do to make this dog happy" and they've done it and they're just examples of the fact that great owners can come out of crappy starts. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To be fair to people though, you can NEVER be prepared for what a dog brings to your life. I’m not saying what these people are doing (and others like them) is ok - it’s absolutely not - but I do wish we’d stop pretending like research was going to get you all the way. It just won’t. You should absolutely research the breed you’re getting and know what it’s going to need from you and if you’re willing to give that but, even then, it might not be enough.

I’ll be honest, I adopted my first dog, thinking I was a “dog person” and would be fine. On top of just the dumbest breed mix for any human being other than, probably a professional (husky cross Aussie), he was reactive and having him was more work than just “are you willing to walk him a lot and play a ton of fetch and do training”. When he passed, we researched our butts off and settled on an English cocker as the right breed for us. Guess what? With all that experience behind me, I was STILL not prepared and still had to make a ton of changes to work with the dog in front of me.

At the end of the day, the difference isn’t so much between people who know what they’re getting into and those who don’t. It’s between those who step up to do what their dog needs and those who don’t. Sounds like these people aren’t doing that, absolutely, and they probs should have gotten a different breed but the “just research the breeds” narrative is also not entirely accurate, imo. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Definitely not the solution for everyone but if you haven’t tried it already it could be worth testing: the pomodoro technique. You set a very specific goal -  “write one paragraph”, “read one section” Or whatever - and then set a timer for 25min to get it done. At the end, take a 5min break. Repeat until you’ve done 4 of them, then take a 25min break. The 25min break can be disruptive if you’re in hyperfocus so I often skip it but the short intervals of work-break-work combined with specific, clear tasks has been specifically useful to me for managing my energy levels. Spending the time away from the screen/work in some structured way helps me build the habit and practice switching focus on and off and makes sure I don’t get exhausted from battling to try and focus for an hour without getting much done. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When projects go on too long and become boring, when processes are too slow and project management are by far the hardest things. But I think the first two are possible to solve, to some degree... Learning to break projects up into pieces or, if possible, step away from it for a week until it’s interesting again and working with the company to speed up processes has helped a lot. The project management, I’m still trying to solve!

But I agree with what some of the other posters said: being really passionate and interested in the work goes a long way to helping! I also procrastinated my way through my masters dissertation - that doesn’t mean it wasn’t good or that I’m a bad researcher, just that I need to learn how to manage my energy and my focus. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just coming here to say I FEEL YOU! Also have an 8mo (English cocker) and he’s being exactly the same way. I didn’t get much puppy blues when he was younger but I swear I’ve sat on the floor crying every other day for a month now. Everyone tells me it’ll pass but I can’t imagine surviving another 2-6 months of this.... what has helped us some is: enforced naps and decreasing his food after he was snipped. The vet suggested that excess calories might have been contributing (I was in this catch 22 where I needed the food for training because he was ALWAYS doing something annoying but supposed to decrease his intake by 30%). Capturing calmness and relaxation protocol are hit and miss for helping tbh. Another thing that made a difference was working out what he ACTUALLY finds stimulating. He doesn’t like fetch. Not a huge fan of Kongs. Not a huge fan of almost anything I’m used to doing to stimulate and exercise  a dog tbh. What DOES tire him out is sniffing and digging so now, instead of taking him for a 30min walk along the trails, we take him to the field across the road where there are a ton of mole hills and let him dig for moles (only caught one once but he held it so gently and dropped it immediately when asked). Instead of Kongs, I do snuffle mats and then stuffed and frozen hooves for when he goes into his crate cause he’ll actually finish those.

Anyways, no idea if any of that will be helpful but wanted to say you’re not alone! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Over-exercise/over-stimulation could definitely be the problem! One of our other issues has been a weird bout of freaking out in the evenings as well, which started about three weeks ago. He's a sensitive dog but not an anxious one and this was definitely anxiety/stress so we were utterly lost as to what the cause was.... our current hypothesis is that he'd come to associate us both sitting on the couch as a variable predictor of something fun happening and was getting stressed in the evenings because he didn't know if something fun was about to happen or not. So far, we're seeing some improvement there after making a few changes to our pre-walk routine (it's amazing what dogs learn when you're not teaching them).


I'll decrease the exercise, increase the relaxation protocol and test out the enforced naps to see how things go. I appreciate the feedback! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for the reply! It’s not that he doesn’t like kongs, they just do less for him than sniffing things does! I do give him a frozen Kong every day (well, dry kibble topped with frozen peanut butter else he won’t eat it) and frozen hooves.

I guess I was hesitant with enforcing naps in the crate because I don’t want it to become something he feels forced into. As it is, he’s less willing to go in this evening than he was yesterday because of us doing the enforced naps today where his “kennel up” used to be very strong. But if it seems like that’s the way forward, I’ll try push through with it - I guess I can always retrain the crate as a happy place once we’re passed this but this is the first time this dog has made me cry :(

Regarding bully sticks and other chews: unfortunately options in South Africa are fairly limited and most of what we can get he’s either not interested in or only lasts a few seconds. I’ll stock up on some boredom busters again and continue with the frozen hooves but maybe try up the value of those in the meantime by stuffing them with extra yummy things.

And again, thank you! It’s frustrating when months worth of work seems to have gone out the window and I feel like an awful puppy parent so it’s nice to hear that we may be on the right track. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi guys.


I need so much help - I'm at my wits end here. I have an 8 month old male English Cocker pup. He was fixed a month ago and is a darling, in general, but his adolescent phase is just so much more than I was expecting (first pup but not first dog). Apologies for length - I want to make sure I capture what we've tried and where that breaks down.


There's a host of issues from barking to biting to suddenly not being good with other dogs but we're mostly managing those and I'm doing my best. The issue right now is settling during the day. I work from home because of COVID and my partner goes to work 3 days a week and works from home the other two. We'd had difficulties with settling before but hit on a routine that seemed to work well:
First thing in the morning, pup goes on a walk to dig for moles. It lasts anywhere between 30 and 45 mins. We tested the length of the walk and the distanced walked and found that there was almost no difference between getting a 30 min walk and an hour walk but a huge difference between getting to sniff and dig in a nearby field versus walking along the paths and sniffing.


Lesson one: he's a very sniffy dog and "find it" games and snuffle mats are more stimulating and enjoyable for him than things like Kongs or wobblers.


Once he gets home, he gets a snuffle mat and then he (used to) settle down and just sleep until 4pm. He has access to my study and a bed by me, as well as his crate in the lounge and he'd pretty much choose between them and move about, depending how he felt. At 4pm, he'd get more active and start some demand barking or simple restlessness. That's fine, he's a puppy and this is the time when he gets his second wind. So, I scheduled a recurring break at work to take him on another walk at 4pm for 30 mins and just take my "lunch" break towards the end of the day. When we get home, I'd give him a kong and finish up my day and then we'd do some training and play and spend some time together until hubby gets home.


At 6pm, he'd get a third walk of 30-45 minutes, which we've been using to try and teach fetch and some tracking games, rather than just sniffing and digging. We end off the walk with a few minutes of digging for moles again and then head home, where he'd get "sprinkles" (some food scattered in the grass in the garden) and then immediately settle down and go to sleep.


This mostly worked for us (some other issues in the evenings but, I believe, those were unrelated). In addition to the above, we've been working on capturing calmness and relaxation protocol (capturing calmness during the day and relaxation protocol in the evenings mostly). But this week, starting Monday, he just became entirely unpredictable. He'd settle after his morning walk for varying lengths of time - between half and hour and 90 minutes - and then go CRAZY. Barking at everything. Barking at nothing. Destroying the couch (which he's never done before) and destroying plants and harassing the cats and all sorts of other things.


**So, what we've tried:**

* relaxation protocol
* capturing calmness
* adding short walks every 90 minutes
* adding training every 90 minutes
* Making his morning walks longer (although, technically, they shouldnt be longer than 45mins anyway)
* Changing where we walk him so that he gets some "walk" time and some "sniff" time on every walk
* adding some puzzle toys at lunch time
* Just sitting by him when he gets hyper/anxious
* Playing tug or find it games when he gets restless

Despite all this, I swear he's gotten worse with the time that he stays settled; going from 6 hours, to 90 minutes to less than 30 minutes now. What else do I try? Today, out of pure desperation, I put him in his crate with a frozen hoof and let him cry it out until he fell asleep. It took him about 10 minutes and he slept for 2 hours. We let him out before he whined and then waited to see if he would settle again. No luck, so back in the crate he went and he settled within 10 minutes again and we're nearing the 2 hour mark now for how long he's been in there.


Enforced naps have never been necessary with him - as long as he's had his needed exercise and stimulation, he's settled just fine. But now I'm wondering if, for some reason, he needs them now? We really don't want to force him into the crate - he chooses to go in there on his own most days at the moment but I'm pretty sure that plopping him in there when he's like this will give some negative connotations or hesitation about being in there in future but I just don't know what else to do. Walks every 90 minutes is simply not feasible with work and meetings and, at this stage, they're not helping anyway. He was recently at the vet and has some canine acne but no other health issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just for contrast: we know our instructor well so she knows my pup is pretty good. That means 50% of the time, she used him as an example in class cause he’s pretty likely to listen. There are PLENTY of times where he doesn’t and she just goes “Senna isn’t feeling it today, let’s try with X”. Embarrassing you is NOT acceptable or conducive to learning and failing to understand that class is a new and difficult environment for a pup just shows bad dog knowledge imo. </TEXT>

<TITLE> Counter surfing and puppy scratching - advice appreciated! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-06-12 17:16:14 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> So I have two, completely unrelated, problems with my 8mo English Cocker Spaniel pup that I would love some thoughts or advice on (in reality, many more than 2 - adolescence really sucks - but these will suffice).


**Basic info on pup:** male, fixed two weeks ago, lives with 2 cats who he is (mostly) ok with. Clicker trained. Used to get two walks per day (\~45 mins) until an oopsie with his harness hurt his ears and now he's scared of it so we're working on that. Replaced that with two, 30min sessions of tug. He is fed all his food in puzzle toys or training and eats the vet-recommended food for puppies. I make his training treats myself (liver bread/fudge that is a godsend).


**Problem 1: he is ALWAYS itchy:** Like, no jokes. He is permanently scratching and grooming himself   e-v-e-r-y-w-h-e-r-e. He's been like this since we got him and we've spoken to a few vets about it, thinking it might be chicken or wheat allergies. Vets have all said that either pups this young are unlikely to have allergies or that, if they do, they might grow out of it and we should ignore it until he's older (none of them have really explained which of the two it is? But both camps just said to ignore it). But it's not getting better, at all, and it just seems really uncomfortable for him. Any ideas on what we could do to make him itch less? I'll admit he doesn't get bathed often because that was an area of socialization/training where we dropped the ball a little but if the feedback is that that will help, then I'm happy to prioritize it in training.


**Problem 2: counter surfing:** So I know the standard ways you're supposed to train this and we have tried everything (I think). But here's the thing: he has **never** gotten a thing off the counter. Not a piece of food, a cloth, a tupperware, nothing. Ever. Combined with never having gotten anything off the counter, we've tried a few things to teach him not to jump up: we've done staged training where we drop treats for 4 on the floor and progressed to lying down. We kept up with that for WEEKS and it made no difference. We tried teaching a "paws off" command and rewarding when he listened to it and it made no difference. If anything, it feels like he's regressed. We'd progressed to the point where we could have dinner at the counter in peace but now he tries to jump up there while we're eating or cooking again. Worth noting that the counter in question is on an "L" portion of our kitchen - the kitchen itself is barricaded so that he cant get in there and reach the counters where we usually leave pots and pans etc. I don't think it's possible to barricade the counter as well, although I could give it a try?


All of this leads me to conclude that *something* must be rewarding for him if he jumps up at the counter? I just can't figure out what. My two best guesses are: we tell him "paws off" if he does it and he considers that attention or he simply finds the sniffing rewarding (he's a VERY sniffy dog - I know all dogs are but, honestly, more than any other dog I've met). Does anyone have ideas about what else it could be that he's finding rewarding about jumping on the counters? Any ideas on how to solve it if it's the attention (ignoring him aside - that seems risky)? Any ideas on how to solve it if it's the sniffing? I know prevention is the best route but I can't prevent the behaviour entirely and I can't prevent it being rewarding if I don't know what he finds rewarding about it.


TIA! </TEXT>

<TEXT> My boy is almost 8mo now and exact same story - the lady who rescued his mom miscalculated in a genuine accident and we brought him home at 6 weeks. Only thing I’d say is be careful in puppy classes/postpone them for a few weeks. He’s a darling now, except for all the shitty adolescent behaviour (you still have that to look forward to, no matter how old you got ‘em at :P) and probably the biggest effect was that bite inhibition and separation training took a little longer. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My pup in 7mo now and, I’ve gotta tell ya, for the first 6 months I resented him so. Damn. Much. I mean. He was cute and we had great times but I kept expecting him - accidentally and subconsciously- to be like my previous dog. I got my previous one as an 8mo rescue and there is a massive difference between 8 weeks and 8 months and I knew that but it just didn’t FEEL right. We got pup from a breeder because our previous dog had a lot of behavioral issues from the neglect he experienced early in life so this was supposed to be a chance to experience dog ownership without that, without all the heartbreak and trauma that came with that. And it has been but it also came with less bonding, somehow. But it DID get better. I didn’t even notice it when it did but I was lying in bed one night, cuddling with pup and realized how much I adore this little soul in front of me, the little guy I have right now. Since then, I’ve noticed more and more moments where I’m just flooded with love for THIS dog and we’re developing new habits and games and things to love. Don’t be too hard on yourself. Take it moment by moment and focus on the dog in front of you, even if it’s just for the sake of training right now. The love will come. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Seems like you have a good head on your shoulders. If you can afford it, think it can fit your life style and are ready for having to do a lot of training, I’d say go for it. IMO there’s not a whole lot to lose - if you figure out it’s not going to work, the dog is no worse off than now and you’ll likely do a better job of finding it a decent home than the current owners. Assuming you’re actually ready and willing for the commitment and it’s not just a case of “well, this dog is available so may as well”. One other thing is that beagles are prone to separation anxiety though. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Beagles are usually listed as one of the breeds that are good with cats. You’ll likely have to do a fair amount of impulse control training with the pup and digging can be a thing that they do but a stimulated, exercised and trained beagle is meant to be a great dog. (I say “meant to be” because I haven’t owned one myself. However, did a fair amount of research and we’ll be getting one next year!). In my opinion, that’s a great age to get a dog at too - old enough to have the patience for training and young enough to not have practiced bad behaviors for years. None of the things you’ve mentioned sound like actual behavioral issues. Also, just for interests sake, my cocker chases birds and squirrels but not the cats so, while there’s no guarantee that the pup will be fine with the cats, chasing rabbits doesn’t mean he’ll automatically chase anything small. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This dog absolutely can exist though? If OP wanted a puppy or a younger dog and wasn't willing to compromise for the "right" dog, then sure. If someone came in asking for a BC that fit all of this, then probably not but a well-bred, well-trained retired show dog or stud could totally meet these requirements. In fact, OP, I applaud your frankness about what you are and aren't willing to do and that you don't seem too hung up on the breed, but rather that the dog matches your lifestyle.


I do think it's likely that only a fairly senior dog will match what you're describing but if you're willing to take the time to get to know the dogs and find the right fit, I reckon you'll be fine. Not convinced on the cockers though - they're great and I love them (my own boy is an English Cocker Spaniel) but they're slightly higher energy than most people give them credit for. Then again, my boy is only 6mo so I have no idea how chill he'll be as an adult tbh. They're also prone to separation anxiety so your work hours (when you get there) might make them a poor fit. They're also pretty barky. I've never met a pom I liked but I come from a country with awful dog culture so that might be why.


Not sure I can give any recommendations on breeds, other than the ones you have listed but it might be a good idea to narrow down to 3-5 options, contact any breeders nearish to you and explain what you're looking for. Go meet the dogs and the breeders, learn about them and see if any of them feel like a fit. The breeders should be able to tell you off the bat if they have a dog that fits that description and when they'll be retiring. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Although a 60min walk a day is good, without off-leash time it’s nowhere near enough for the breeds you mention. My Aussie cross needed two 2 hour hikes a day to keep him vaguely manageable, with a solid game of fetch before and after. None of those dogs are “low energy”, either. Sounds to me like most of the poodles would be a better fit, or a cocker spaniel (probably biased as my boy is one but cockers are GREAT dogs and seem to meet the needs of a lot of households). </TEXT>

I’m AWFUL at habits and, even if I remember, half the time my anxiety means I just. Don’t. Want. To. So we’ve delegated in my house: I think up the things that I think are going to help us and my SO takes responsibility for them getting done. That doesn’t mean he actually DOES all of them but we’ve discussed and agreed on ways he can remind me/ tell me to do things that we’ve agreed to beforehand. For example, he’s just headed to the shops for our essentials trip so, before he left, he asked me to clean the kitchen before he gets back. If we hadn’t discussed it, that would be frustrating as all hell but we spoke and our agreement includes that (a) the kitchen needs to be cleaned every day, (b) we take turns doing it, and (c) on my days, he needs to give me a deadline. </TEXT>

My spouse is a “physical affection” kind of person. So we had to talk about ways he could show me love that aren’t touch AND ways that I can still show him love that aren’t touch because it’s important that I still show him love and affection, even if it’s not in the language he understands best.

<TITLE> Large plot, tons of weeds - help! </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-04-10 12:30:37 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> Hi all! On mobile so apologies for formatting.

My fiancé and I bought a house (we’re in South Africa) with a large yard. The whole plot is near 600sqm and the house itself is only around 80sqm. The yard is pretty barren - there’s some grass growing in patches and we’ve started building some flower beds along the edges already.

We have 2 main problems:
1. Our soil is AWFUL. It’s basically sand and gravel and there are many patches where there’s more gravel than sand which we need to get rid of before we can work in better soil and compost etc.
2. We have a LOT of weeds and a large variety of them. We’ve managed to get rid of most of the stinging nettles and the weeds that grow like ground cover but there are two remaining types that are driving me mad: one makes “devil thorns” and another makes a round seed with little spokes that catches into the dogs fur and basically anything vaguely soft.

I walk the garden almost daily and pull out what I can and we’ve sprayed the whole yard down with a pretty strong weed killer but, as you can imagine, it gets expensive and is extremely time consuming. It might be worth noting a few things at this stage: we’ve got a garden design that we’re planning on starting post-winter (which is coming up now and, in our area, is very wet and very cold) and we’re only planning a small area of lawn, which we’ll buy in rolls and plant next winter for it to set.

Basically, I don’t mind if everything dies except the flower beds (where the weed control is easier regardless).

Wanted to hear if anyone has any ideas on how to get rid of these types of weeds at a large scale? Bonus if you have tricks to make moving the gravel easier too, but I’m guessing that’s one I’ll just have to suck up! I was thinking that maybe laying down plastic for three or so weeks to stop any sunlight might be a good idea? Maybe after lay down newspaper with mulch over it and let the rain do it’s work to double as a weed killer and improve the soil quality? My worry is that this won’t kill the seeds and the problem will just come up again next year in better soil? </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have a 5mo cocker boy so limited experience but so far:
- he’ll chase the cats if they run (which we’re working on!) but your best bet is to try and avoid letting them practice that behaviour when they’re young and then they shouldn’t do it as adults. If the cats aren’t running, he’s a darling with them.
- he does chase birds and, frankly, I let him. He never catches them and I’m happy for him to get the stimulation. Pretty sure you could prevent or train it out though.
- my previous dog was an Aussie-husky cross. He shed so much we’re still finding dust bunnies of his fur, 8 months later. Relative to him, I haven’t noticed any shedding from my cocker boy. So, medium-to-low shedding, depending on what you consider high shedding to be ;) </TEXT>

So I’ll do “Day 1” three or four times during the day whenever he’s gotten excited over something and then the same with day 2 etc. we also repeat the entire protocol multiple times in different contexts - after a walk, while we’re cooking, each person in the house individually, when people are over, each room in the house and so on and so forth. It’s literally my starting point when I want to train almost anything is to make sure he can relax with that thing or in that context first. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We basically had to just keep an eye out for what was stimulating him and adjust those. That meant replacing a stuffed kong with sprinkling his food in the grass because he finds chewing exciting and sniffing calming. We had to change the way we did walks and introduce new areas slowly because exploring someplace new was highly arousing. Make sure that he can’t see my partner leave in the mornings because seeing him go is stressful.

And then we replaced things like fetch and tug with the cup game and find it games. And replaced the wobbler with a snuffle mat. And then adjusted our routine to add calming exercises (like the relaxation protocol) after exciting events (like a walk) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Jumping on here to say it’s also worth trying Karen Overall’s protocol for relaxation to teach pup to settle down. You’d need to catch her before she gets over-tired but a timer should help with this (set an alarm for 45mins after she’s woken up and then do it). Also work on impulse control using ItsYerChoice and teach a “mat” command using HotZone.

For us, nothing really helped with the biting until he just grew out of it tbh so time outs or walking away were needed just for us to keep some semblance of patience and calm. It’ll get better with time. It’s worth re-looking at your routine and seeing if the things you’re doing with her are over-stimulating her. When we entered the “I can’t do this anymore stage”, I looked at daily life from his perspective and realized that EVERYTHING in his day was exciting or stressful and we replaced some games and aspects of the routine with things that were calming and quiet and that made the world of difference. Good luck!

Edit: I mixed up trainers. Corrected to Karen Overall </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hi redditors! I have a gorgeous 5mo cocker spaniel pup who is coming along nicely ito his socialization and training. One of the struggles we’re having is that he gets over-stimulated VERY easily (understandable, he’s a baby) and has a fairly low frustration tolerance (also understandable and we’re working on it - any tips for this are welcomed!). One of the ways that this plays out is in training: he’ll work for his kibble around 80% of the time but he takes too long to eat it during training and our trainer recommended using something softer or smaller. Except, if we use anything else (liver bread, cheese, chicken, chicken sausage) then he gets SOOO excited about the food that training is near impossible. I can get a sit, down and leave it from him but if we take more than a few seconds to give him the treat, he’s jumping and snapping for it.

So, questions:
A) any suggestions for other training treats we can use instead that might be “medium reward”? I was wondering if I should buy a different kibble that he only gets in training, for instance?
B) any suggestions on training we can do to build up the frustration tolerance? We’ve done a fair amount of impulse control work and he still has a long way to go but not sure if there’s something we should be adding to that?

TIA! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some of the random things that have helped me:
- I made one, single, “clean house rule” and that was the ONLY one I needed to stick to. For me, it was keeping the kitchen counter clean (not the one where the dishes go before you wash them, the one where you prepare food). Over time, I could add more “rules” and I did that by going in order of what would have the biggest impact on my mental health (also CPTSD, GAD, depression and undiagnosed ADHD here so I know those feels!)
- I came up with a “tiny tasks” list that I have on my phone or, nowadays, in my bullet journal where I just jot down all the small things I keep meaning to do - move that basket, tidy that drawer, send that email, look up that recipe, whatever. In breaks or moments when I feel I can’t do anything else, I can usually manage one thing on the Tiny Tasks list.
- not sure if it’s the economist in me but the biggest game changer was actually timing how long it took me to do things. I did it once for all the standard chores (dishes, laundry, sweeping etc) and it helped SO MUCH because I was convinced that hanging up laundry took 20 minutes but, when I timed it..... it took 3. Three minutes is something I can almost always do (not true for everyone, I know). Plus, the novelty of timing meant that I got through a fair amount in the week that I was collecting the data.
- last thing was the “pile and sort” method. I usually start by gathering all the mess into one spot - one the bed if it’s folding laundry, on a counter, in the corner of a specific room - and then, at least, the mess is all together. One massive pile of things to do feels more manageable than a scattered, messy room and, on top of that, I can add “pack one thing  from the pile away” to my Tiny Tasks list and just go through it gradually. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA. Although, I will say this: my dad cheated on my mum for 3 years and EVERYONE knew except her. Eventually, her best friend approached my dad and told him “either you tell her or I will” and gave him a (short) deadline. The friend ended up telling my mum, including the part where she confronted my dad. My mum has always said that this was the best way anyone could have handled it, in her opinion. She was also in denial and angry when she was told, that’s natural, but she got over it pretty quick. I would have screen shot his profile and spoken to him about it - if they’ve been together 8 years, he was DEFINITELY active on it while they were together, even if he wasn’t active then. Giving him the chance to tell her plus showing her the profile without sending messages, if he didn’t, would have likely made you less of a “target” for her misplaced anger. </TEXT>

<TEXT> We have two resident cats. The youngest, Newt, got curious about puppy from day 2 or 3 and would inch closer while pup was distracted or busy with something else. By the end of week 1, they had booped noses. It’s now the end of week 5 and they’re playing beautifully together and they’ve cuddled once.

The older cat, Scout, is another story altogether! She’s always taken a while to warm up to other animals (it took her almost 2 months to stop hissing and swatting at newt and almost a year before they started to play). She started off staying in a different room altogether from pup. Nowadays, she’ll be in the same room as him as long as she’s out of his reach and they’ve booped noses two or three times. My prediction is that she’ll only ever tolerate him but I’m still hoping to be surprised! </TEXT>

<TEXT> A good bet might be to read up on how to socialize humans and new bunnies because they’re often like this and the advice is the same (and there’s a whole lot written about it!). Basically: give him a safe space (crate) that you do not invade, ever. Confine him to one room or area at first and then sit in a far corner and just read or watch a show on your phone with headphone in. Ignore him entirely. Toss treats away from you (you can slowly bring them closer) and just sit there. Let him come out at his own pace and, when he does, ignore him. If he comes up to you, ignore him. If he engages with you, ignore him. Have some treats in your lap, pocket or hand and if he tries to eat those, let him but ignore him further than that. Repeat as many times per day as you can, giving him a good few hours break in between. Set up some Astro or newspaper/pee pads all over the floor so he can eliminate when he feels safe to do so. Once he’s approaching you with some confidence, start moving - do so slowly and just lift a hand and put it back down etc. Chances are, you’ll hit a tipping point and be able to jump steps to where you can love and cuddle him but assume you can’t unless you’re 100% sure you’re not going to spook him. And remember the two week shutdown. It’s hard but he’ll get there - just give him time and be patient. </TEXT>

<TEXT> NTA. I just wanted to add my two cents. When my partner did something similar, I spoke to him about it a few days later. I said that I felt hurt because the gift wasn’t something I would use and it felt like he didn’t put any thought into what to get me. His response was: I understand. I felt pressed for time and stressed and didn’t put in as much thought as I should have. I’m sorry it won’t be on Christmas Day and that I hurt you but will you give me the chance to try again?

We returned the gift he gave me for Christmas and then he spent a day or two thinking about it went out and bought me something I loved and that he’d put thought into. Everyone makes mistakes but I want to point out that how people respond is more important. I hope you guys can work it out. </TEXT>

<TEXT> To practice timing: my trainer recommended bouncing a ball and trying to click each time it hit the ground. Work on it until your click matches the bounce perfectly - just make sure you do this when your dog isn’t around! Shaping games are also a great way to practice clicker timing. My coordination is awful so I get my partner to bounce the ball while I click away :P </TEXT>

<TEXT> Read Angela Duckworth’s book, Grit, for some of this. Super interesting. Although not exactly her argument, the behavioral science behind inspiring more intrinsic motivation, as paradoxical as it seems, is to spend more time invested in the thing. It’s a longer road but all of the habit and behavioral literature says start small and build up. Given the information you’ve given, I’d recommend starting with inspiring a passion for food in a healthy way and, even then, start small. Ask her to help you find recipes or ideas for healthier treats that satisfy her sweet tooth. Let her get excited about trying them and finding the right fit - make it something fun and exciting to explore. That can build to finding healthier foods that she enjoys more generally (like for lunches) and to portion control. Similar with exercise: swimming is what got me to the gym because I loved swimming and, once I was there, it was easier to stay. Finding something - literally anything - that she actually enjoys doing and can get passionate and excited about will help her build a love for exercise and healthy living more generally. I can’t afford a gym contract right now so I don’t have access to a pool but I found that I loved gardening an absurd amount. So, now, I go on hikes to look for new indigenous plants for my garden. I dig up beds and move rocks and build water features, which isn’t exercise in the traditional sense but it sure as hell is better than nothing. Hiking was hard but I loved finding the new plants so I started walking in the mornings to make the hiking (and finding the plants) easier (this is called temptation bundling). It means being patient and getting creative but it’s possible - feel free to DM me if you want to bounce ideas or get some thoughts. Final thought: people are seldom “just lazy”. Things are either too difficult or the motivation isn’t there or there’s something else going on (like physically or mental health wise). From what you’ve described, it sounds like you’ve tried to make it easy but maybe that’s not really solved the issues she has because maybe she doesn’t know what those issues are. Short bursts of change suggest that the desire to change is there but something else is making it hard to maintain. All of which suggests to that seeing a psychologist is probs a good idea for her. If she stops “trying to try”, that’s when I’d be worried. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I don’t really have an opinion one way or the other on the asshole-ness of not dating a woman for being infertile. Tbh, that’s 100% happened to me and I understood - having biological kids is super important to some people and that’s their prerogative. Maybe it is asshole (esp because things like surrogacy exist) but the only point is that there’s a difference between being an asshole because you don’t want to date a woman who’s infertile and transphobic. If this dude didn’t want to date her because she’s trans (and therefore implies she’s not a real woman), that’s transphobic. If he doesn’t want to date any woman who’s infertile, he might be an ass but he’s not necessarily transphobic. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe the answer here is in the phrasing? You said you think she’s beautiful? It sounds to me like this is less about attraction and more about goals for life. If a hetero couple were on a date and one said “I want kids, it’s a dealbreaker” and the other said “I don’t want kids at all”, they could be extremely attracted to each other but choose not to date.... you have every right to date who you want, obviously, but I think her assumption was “this person was attracted to me before they found out I’m trans and now they say they’re not” and that kinda IS transphobic. That said, you communicated extremely respectfully and I applaud that. </TEXT>

<TEXT> There should also be desensitization games you can play for this. I don’t know for fetch specifically but our boy started a ball obsession and the trainer helped us work through it by having him in a down and starting to show him the ball but he had to stay down and he got a treat. Then bouncing the ball in front of him. Then rolling it, then tossing it, then tossing many. We progressed from there to using fetching the ball as a reward but he had to wait for a cue (“get it”) before he could go for it. I know you’re isn’t for a ball specifically and we caught it early but searching for fetch obsession and being a bit creative with the training might help, especially if you pair it with the things suggested here (especially the capturing calmness and the specific toys for fetch). </TEXT>

<TEXT> All of this. But before you hand in your resignation, go find out what someone with your experience and knowledge should be earning (there are websites that give you this information). Find that salary and, if they ask what it would take for you to stay and you would actually consider staying, ask for that amount and don’t budge. Tell them “this is what the market average is for my role” and give them the info to back it up. Chances are they won’t match it but it’s good practice for you to stand your ground and know what you’re worth. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Second what the others have said but also - good job! Your pup has beautiful focus and your tone is great :) you can definitely be proud of this progress at 9 weeks!

A few things I’d suggest: I taught “touch” (where he touches my hand with his nose) very early on. There are SO MANY ways that this is helpful (a lot of people report that their dogs prefer touch to recall so they actually use touch as a kind of recall) but it helps with luring later on and, why I introduced it so early, it is an easy command that gets him from a sit or a down back into a stand to set him up for a repeat on the trick. This helps prevent the pup from chaining tricks together (sit-down-stay becoming a consistent, predictable series of tricks). It does, obviously, chain “touch” to the end of any trick you teach but I’m ok with that because touch is a great check in tool.

Second, I’d introduce short play sessions in between tricks. So before you move from repeating down to repeating sit, play and tussle for a bit. Giving pup a break from training is good and helps separate what you’re asking for but it also teaches focus even after being hyped up by play (which is REALLY important for a dog like a border collie).

I’d also make use of that great focus and teach “look at me” or “focus” now - it’s just easier to do when they’re already offering it so consistently.

Finally (although I don’t see it in this video), if your pup is getting over excited for treats during training then try mixing high and low value treats into your bag for one training session. Might not work for all dogs but it did the trick with mine and has the added benefit of an automatic variable reinforcement rate, which increases learning. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Crate training or putting her into a puppy proof room that you’ve made her safe space is your best bet there! It’s do-able and you can make progress but just as a heads up, it will be a lot harder to get her better if she panics every other day when you’re gone. I know that’s really discouraging and I genuinely don’t mean to be negative - I think working really hard now while you’re on break can possibly get you far enough that it will be ok but just be prepared for that as well. Just keep it in mind and see if there’s anything you can figure out if it becomes a problem - I actually learned about separation anxiety through someone else who became a friend. We met when she was paying me R50 a day (works out to about $3) to sit with her pup. I was a student with very few classes and needed the extra cash and I got free WiFi and coffee for the day. We became best friends after that and have both learned a lot about dogs because of our respective difficult rescues. Point being: if it’s only a few classes a week, you might be able to find a student somewhere who’s happy to help for a good price. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Separation anxiety takes a long time to work on so you’ll likely need to figure out some measures to manage the situation in the meantime. Probably your best bet for management is to hire a dog sitter or get her into doggy daycare just to prevent her from disturbing others while you work on the training.

For training: start by removing or reducing leaving cues and then desensitizing for the rest of them. So make sure that you’ve grabbed your keys, coat, shoes etc 10 or so minutes before you leave so that she doesn’t start getting anxious before you leave. Then work on desensitizing the ones you can’t remove (like walking to the door). Walk to the door and back, treating for calm behavior. Repeat until she stays calm when you get to the door (if she starts whining before you get to the door, then only take a few steps towards it when you start this training). Then open the door and come back - repeat until she’s calm with that. Then step out and come back. You get the point.

When you get to actually leaving, you need to take it suuuuper slow. Leave the room (but in the same house) and time how long it takes before she starts whining. I’ve found it easiest to start singing the ABCs as my way of timing because I know the time it takes me to get to a letter will always be the same, where if I count or try and press a timer on my phone then I might count faster or slower on one day than another. The first time, you’re going to work out how long it takes her to start whining - for my pup, he started whining when I got to “C”. Then I started walking out the room, singing just “A” and walking back in - repeat 10-20 times. 3 to 5 sessions like this, I timed how long it took him to start whining again (we’d moved up to “D”) and then I started singing to “B” before I came back in. It’s tedious but you want to only be gone for as long as your dog can handle so never leave them until they whine or get stressed. If you’re home for a good while, you can make good progress because you can do this multiple times per day in the beginning. Obviously when you start getting to 30+ minutes then it becomes harder but a lot of dogs reach a tipping point around there where, if they’re ok with 30 mins then they’re fine with a number of hours (not all dogs though!).

There’s a really fantastic book on amazon called “Be Right Back” that’s worth a read - it actually gives you a training schedule that you can use to work on this and helps you figure out when to progress with longer periods. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Had a similar issue with my boy so we worked on shaping games - 101 things to do with a box and HotZone. First few sessions were HELL because he’d just lie down and look at me expectantly so I started tossing the treat (into the box for 101 things and past the mat for HotZone) and then clicking for any movement towards the box or mat. Click, toss again. It took about 3 sessions of playing before he started engaging with the new objects instead of lying at my feet and about 5 or 6 before he started offering new behaviors in training sessions. I took a similar approach when we hit a wall with luring (I wanted him to climb onto a wooden table) - I just got super excited and ran around and let him chase me for a bit then would put him in a sit-stay on the other side of the table and tell him to “mush” (his release cue) and start waving my arms about and moving away from him - he’d put a paw on the table and I’d click and treat and then go again. Eventually got him on the table and jumping over it on cue (it was a low, small table) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Honestly, lack of comparability isn’t a bad reason to return a dog but I do think you have give it your best shot first. We’re not a very outdoorsy household either but I came to love our evening walks where we just strolled along and I watched birds and we did some training (also an Aussie mix so super high energy). Training and solo walks were actually the perfect thing for my introvert soul because it was a kind of one-on-one communication that really filled my emotional cup. In the mornings, my partner and I packed a flask of coffee and sat on a hill near the house and played fetch and had family time with the dog and it was amazing. We focused on training and brain games and indoor exercise (like a flirt pole) to curb excess energy. But I think the biggest game changer for me was two things: 1. I knew I wasn’t going to get there overnight, so I set myself small goals and built up to the best routine I could give him; 2. I set myself a time line and an ideal routine for him. When I reached that routine, I gave myself a certain amount of time to see if I could be happy doing all this and if it was enough for him and made my decisions from there (in the end, we lost our boy to a brain injury from puppyhood) but I found that the gradual change and having something to work towards helped.

My advice: work out what you CAN give him and do that. If either of you are miserable after a set amount of time, then reconsider but really give it your best shot. You’d be amazed at what you’ll enjoy if you just give yourself some time to adjust to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Look into BAT 2.0 (pdf should be available online) and try joining some reactive dog facebook groups - there’s lots of support and info available on there. The essence of the training is: keep her below threshold (I.e. far enough away that she doesn’t react) and reward her for calm Behaviour and then slowly reduce the distance. I appreciate that this might not be feasible in an apartment context so it might be worth looking into some of Victoria Stilwell’s methods (It’s me or the dog on YouTube) - I haven’t quite decided how I feel about them yet tbh but they might be more appropriate/practical for your circumstances. </TEXT>

<TITLE> 8wo puppy chasing the cats to play... </TITLE>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> My partner and I brought home our 8wo English cocker spaniel pup two days ago. Things are going well so far and we’re making progress on house training, sit, down and hand targeting (thank you, clicker training). For the first day, he roughly ignored the cats (we have 2). Then he started showing some interest but all was still ok - my older cat keeps away from him but is pretty calm about it and the younger cat is very curious and comes to check him out. They’ve touched noses a few times.

Today, pup started trying to initiate play with the younger cat - play bows and a bark or two. Then he started running up to the cat to play. When supervised/in a play session, pup is on a drag line and otherwise he’s in his pen/crate or tethered to us. Cat, obviously, runs away. The cat isn’t too worried about it - he comes back soon after, lays and watches pup from less than 30cm, lets pup walk up to him if pup is calm and plays with his flirt pole while pup is playing with us.

That said, I don’t want pup to learn that chasing the cats is ok. I’ve worked with a cat reactive dog before and had to do counter conditioning and desensitization so I know that process but I’m not sure what the protocol is here. Pup just wants to play? I don’t know if it’s like jumping/play biting in that there’s a certain amount of leeway he gets as a puppy and a lesson he’ll learn when he actually catches up to the cat? That doesn’t feel right though.

So far I’m trying to just interrupt the Behaviour but would love to know if there’s more I should be doing? (Also: I realize this is something I should have worked out before he came home. For all the research I did, I feel like an idiot for not having worked this part out.) All advice appreciated! </TEXT>

<TEXT> I haven’t raised one myself (our little guy arrives next week!) but I’ve met a few and my partners father had one. They were bred to flush out woodcock and retrieve birds so they have soft mouths. High energy and quite smart, with soft, gentle temperaments. Known to be really great family dogs - good with kids and high chance of being good with cats/small animals. They are prone to separation anxiety though (as well as ear problems).

There’s a bit of hype around “cocker rage” but I’ve looked into it (and discussed it with our vet and trainer) and it seems like it’s a sample selection problem - everyone expects the dogs to be gentle and friendly so they ignore the signs of stress and then dogs snap. But that’s got nothing to do with the breed and everything to do with humans.

They have a bark on them but aren’t incessant barkers. The general expression from people are “they make awful guard dogs because they love everyone” but they ought to let you know if someone comes into your property. For me, they seem like a good size - not a small dog but on the smaller side of medium. Very genuinely, our answers to all the questions were very similar to yours and the English Cocker or Beagle were our top choices - we’ll still get a beagle one day but a cocker came up from a breeder we trust in a better time frame for us and we loved both breeds. Because we were looking into this after having lost our reactive/aggressive rescue, we consulted with a LOT of experts (the whole team who was working with us to help our rescue boy) to figure out the best suited breed for us and this was the consensus from everyone :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Beagle or English cocker spaniel? Our answers looked similar to yours and these were the two breeds we settled on, after consulting our trainer and vet.

Edit: English cocker spaniel - I know nothing about American cockers at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Lots of great advice here but will add one more thing: for tiring her out without walks, you can try a flirt pole. You might need to build drive for it but a sighthound should take to it fairly quick and you can use it indoors or in small spaces! They’re also super cheap and easy to make. Teaching her to love the flirt pole will also save your sanity if the weather is awful or you’re sick or injured and can’t keep up the walks and can help teach impulse control (which should also help with the jumping). Upping the exercise and mental stimulation, along with what you’re already doing and age, should help with the jumping and play biting. Keep your chin up and try a few solutions before you decide it’s more than you can take on - there’s no shame in admitting that, if it’s true, but give both of you some time to figure out this new life :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not a dog trainer but I can sympathize so much with this! We rescued an 8mo pup who started showing a series of behavioral issues (including chasing the cats). We kept them separate and started CC and DS training. We had baby gates up throughout our house to give the cats space. We worked to train him to sleep away from us so that the cats would at least get some attention in the evenings. We had huge difficulties with people aggression so we never (except for training purposes) has anyone in the house. We walked him at midnight and at 5am when no one else was out. We consulted a vet behaviorist, had a personal dog trainer every week, never went anywhere or did anything. Spent a ton of money on medication and food because he couldn’t eat commercial kibble. I spent 8hours a week in the kitchen making him food. Blacked out all our windows to stop him seeing out where he could spot triggers. Trained the neighbors dogs to stop fence running so we could actually take him into the yard. Trained him to stop fence running so we could take him into the yard. Bought a house with a yard so we could minimize the triggers on walks (literally, we bought a house we weren’t planning on buying until we’d paid off our student debt).

Eventually, after a year with almost no improvement, we had to start asking ourselves questions about his quality of life and ours. We did everything in our power to help him but we couldn’t give him a home where he could get enough exercise, no triggers and enough training - for him to he helped, he would have needed a no-pet household on a farm with someone doing full time training. We tried, but that was impossible to find. A month ago, we put our baby boy down. I still cry about it and I still feel an awful amount of guilt but the more I speak to other dog owners and read things on here and watch dog shows/YouTube, the more I can see that he was not ok and I don’t think he ever could have been. Or, at least, we couldn’t find the space where he could be.

I’m not saying that’s the case for you at all. Just thought it might be nice to know that someone understands and that, in my opinion, this doesn’t say anything about you as a dog owner, dog trainer, or human being.

Edit: rehoming him was also complicated by the legal side of things in my country, because he had bitten one person. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Maybe try “ItsYerChoice” instead of standard leave it training. It’s designed to help dogs generalize better for “nothing on the ground is allowable”. Google or YouTube should bring it up quickly. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Most professionals agree that the whole “Cocker rage” hype is from sample selection bias...people expect the dogs to be calm and sweet so they do less to socialize them and don’t pay attention to signals or signs that the dogs are uncomfortable. On top of that, more people report bites from cockers than larger dogs because if a larger dog bites then its “just the breed” but if a cocker does then “it must be aggressive”. Finally, people are usually more likely to push the limits with smaller, gentle dogs - think about how you need to be interacting with a cocker spaniel for it to bite your face... you’d need to be pretty close to it, possibly crowding it and it could just be scared. In short: any breed can be aggressive and its all about training and socialization. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks for this! Really solid advice and some things I haven’t already tried so thats super useful! Makes a lot of sense, as he also gets more anxious if we’re in the room but doing “other” things - makes me inclined to think this may be part of the answer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> If we’re in the same room, he settles just fine and is completely calm. I’ve worked through the relaxation protocol twice already and it made a huge difference from when he first came home but hasnt seemed to help with this problem a whole lot.

Wrt the SA training- after upping the exercise, that was my first step. There are times when he settles, but i havent been able to pick up on a trend as to whats different about those times versus the times he cant settle. As for how long before he gets destructive: it varies but usually within 2 minutes

Response to edit:
We’ve taped since and his days at home are still good with no signs of anxiety or boredom. Routine definitely could be improved but, if anything, its more set these last two weeks. Preexisting behavior is possible! (Hope I got it all!)  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Hey! We taped his stays for the first two weeks when we were training him to be left alone and periodically tape now to check how he’s holding up. Genuinely is very calm during the day :) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry, thats really not what i meant at all! We spend all evening with him and i work flexi time so he’s being walked, trained and played with for multiple hours before bed time. This largely applies when we need to do something in another room or when we go to bed or try and sleep in on weekends. As far as “normal” routines go, he gets more attention and exercise than almost any dog i know  </TEXT>

<TITLE> Help — attention seeking behavior </TITLE>

<TEXT> Hi all! My rescue husky-cross-aussie has started with some pretty intense attention-seeking behavior in the past two weeks and we’d love any advice!

For context: he’s just turned 1 and been home with us about 4mo (rescue, no real info on his past except that he was adopted and returned numerous times). He gets a good walk plus game of fetch every evening and a short, sniffy walk every morning. Because of the heat (and some truly cruel people in our area), he stays indoors while we’re at work. We leave him with a kong and alternate a variety of puzzle toys throughout the week. He goes on his long walk as soon as i get home.

He’s doing REALLY well with being at home while we’re at work and there are barely any issues (although there are some days that go less well). The problem at the moment is, the moment my partner and i are home but not in the room with him (ie, we’re in the bedroom or a different room that he doesnt have access to), he starts up with a variety of unwanted behaviors. These include scratching and whining at the door but also include counter surfing (which he doesn’t do otherwise), and digging through things to steal stuff that he subsequently destroys. By this I literally mean that he’ll dig or nose through bags/boxes/drawers/anything available to find something and then take only that thing and chew it up.

Really not sure what to do to help curb some of this as playing, training, walking or toys don’t seem to make a difference.

Any advice would be appreciated!
TIA

EDIT: thanks all for the comments! Figured it is worth noting that when we take him on his evening walk, it’s off leash in a forest and lasts between 1-2 hours and includes a game of fetch in intervals between this. He gets obedience training throughout the afternoon and early in the morning and this behavior persists, even if we’ve spent an entire day out hiking or at doggy daycare.  </TEXT>

<TEXT> Sorry I’m late on the uptake here! Update: they’ve bonded beautifully and often choose to be together rather than with mum! 😝 i went away for two days and that sorted them right out  </TEXT>

<TEXT> We had a similar problem in our home: I bonded with our adopted pupper immediately (and he bonded with me too - Velcro dog to the max) and my partner didn’t at all. He’s glad we got him, thinks he’s lovely but doesn’t *love him yet. What really helped was having them do things just the two of them - walks, training etc. When they got some time together and didn’t have me interfering then they bonded a lot more. Perhaps you can try take the new dog on a one-on-one walk every other day or try some training that’s specific to it - something you haven’t already done with the resident dog?  </TEXT>
