I have a graduate degree, speak several languages, have published research papers, and have many other talents, (not the least of which is behaving appropriately in public), yet I am homeless.
It makes sense that when every other societal safety net has been exhausted, the only people who have slipped so far between the cracks that they run around in intersections in the middle of the night screaming nonsense are people who are quite literally psychotic. Psychosis simply means being disconnected from reality. People who are not connected to reality act weird. And there are quite a few people who have slipped through every crack in society’s safety net. You seem to have encountered some of them. </TEXT>

But I’ll venture a guess surrounding the word *sacks.* A hundred or more years ago, it was common for the lower classes in America (and presumably other countries as well) to make dresses out of flour sacks, if that was the only fabric they could get.

<TEXT> People use balance transfers because it can save them a ton on interest. Let’s say you have $5,000 you owe on a credit card with a 13.99% APR. If you can only pay $100 each month, it’ll take you six years to pay it off, and you’ll pay about $2,500 in interest when all is said and done. It’s worth it if you can spend a year paying no interest. That would save you at least $400. And balance transfers don’t have much impact on your credit score if any. </TEXT>

Rebellion. Oliver Cromwell. Catholics vs Protestants, more rebellion, England stomped. Great Famines I and II, starvation, disease, death. mass emigration to the U.S. and other countries, major population drop.

<TEXT> Not enough geography is taught here in the U.S.

And just for fun, here are the most interesting and unusual classes I took in public school.

Elementary school: my entire sixth grade year (age 12) was unusual and fun. I was fortunate enough to have a teacher who emphasized poetry, taught us about foreign cultures (we did tinikling!) and took us on scads of field trips. We even produced a play at the end of the year that was a Motown musical based on the children’s book “St George and the Dragon.”

Junior High School (age 13-14): bicycle touring, swimming, sex education (taught by my uncle — awkward!), literature of New England in the 1800s, California history

High school: photography (including the lab to develop film and print photos), Swahili,
Olympic-style gymnastics, American Sign Language, German, World of Media (critical theory), Concert Chorale, Poetry Writing, Ceramics, Elementary Physics, Social Living (sex education and more), and Women’s Studies.

My high school also offered the following courses that I didn’t take but some of my friends did: Art Metal, Screenprinting, Jazz Band, Auto Shop, African-Haitian Dance, Stagecraft, Italian, Journalism, and Advanced Placement sciences, AP math subjects, and AP Latin.

Lower division university courses at a public school (community college): I took Tap Dance, Modern Dance, Japanese, Critical Thinking, Cultural Geography, Physical Geography, Classical Guitar, Native American History, Child Psychology, Asian-American Studies, and Ecology.

Of course, at all of these schools we also had to take the normal subjects: English, Math, History, Biology, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I do wonder... with so many people unemployed now and so many businesses closed or closing, will the gig world of work take over? Lots of employers want to avoid paying for benefits, so it seems that whenever they have the option, they choose to use contractors or freelancers instead of hiring people. This would have quite an effect on the world of health insurance. I have had to buy my own health insurance for most of my adult life, as I am self-employed, so I speak from experience. I’ve actually had all three experiences: having no insurance, having employer-provided insurance, and paying all of my premiums and copays (paying out of pocket for a policy). </TEXT>

In other words, be very upfront and matter of fact about your situation with everyone you have a responsibility to, and ask them what the minimum required is. Ask for their help in prioritizing your work. You may be surprised to find that some of the things you’re stressing over aren’t that important to them, and that there are some shortcuts you can take without ruining the final result.

<TEXT> An interesting theory, but in many countries the opposite has proven to be true. Of course it’s hard to replicate the exact scenario we’re living in and project into the future.
That said, I’d rather take the risk of paying a bit more and save lives than trying to save money by neglecting people who are suffering. At this point in U.S. history, the upper classes are paying less in taxes than they ever have. For the first time, the middle class is paying more (proportionately) than the rich, and to fund a lot of bullshit. That doesn’t make sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT> In the Portland area, usually you have to choose two:

- quiet
- walkable
- green
- family-oriented
- progressive (liberal)
- not bad for parking, commuting
- diverse
- good restaurants & groceries

If you’re really lucky you can get three from
the list in one spot.
If you tell me which ones are most important to you, I can probably tell you what areas to rule out or rule in. It depends on your budget and if you want to rent first or buy right away. Coming from L.A., you probably haven’t under-budgeted.
One of the biggest shockers for this former Californian was the lack of diversity outside of Portland. </TEXT>

Some people feel (especially when they’re new to meditating) that clearing one’s mind over and over again is futile, because we are primates and we are prone to having “monkey mind” (especially those of us with a higher-than-average level of anxiety).

<TEXT> A young man is miserable living at home with his crazy mother, so he moves in with a couple of friends. He gets a job that pays minimum wage. For a couple years he scrapes by, but then he realizes that if he ever wants a better job, he’s going to need a car. He wants to buy a reliable used car. He saves up a little money, but he’s not able to find a reliable, affordable used car nearby in time to start his new job. He decides he needs a car loan. So he manages to get a car loan, gets a used car, and starts the new job. It pays better than the last one, and he makes the payments on time. Still squeaking by because he has to pay for rent, utilities, car payment, car insurance, food, clothes, etc. Then he decides to propose to his girlfriend because he let another wonderful girl get away last year and he doesn’t want that to happen again. In order to get a ring, he gets a credit card. He’s still very frugal, but you can see where this is going. </TEXT>

The long-term effects are in the areas of multi-tasking and complex problem solving, as well as an 85% loss of sense of smell. I also have some lability, which is listed in the frontal lobe on this diagram. </TEXT>

<TEXT> As a human, you should know not to be so dismissive and make so many assumptions
about whether or not I evaluated the sites’ reliability. And surely you know that the government is not always totally reliable when it comes to statistics.
To prevent conflict and to keep people engaged, ask more questions. You could have asked me which sites I was referring to, for example. You could have explained why you don’t think anecdotal evidence is worth considering. You could have shared detailed statistics from the census you referenced.

I’m just assuming here that you actually do want to interact with people to some extent, otherwise you wouldn’t have posted on Reddit. But I’d wager that the way you have gone about it has likely alienated dozens of people who would otherwise have participated in the discussion. </TEXT>

Think of it as having three approaches. Light, medium, and heavy. If the picture is really light, you might be able to just hang it anywhere. But get a box of picture-hanging nails. They come with a brace attached. For medium-weight pictures, you knock on the wall until you find a stud, then drive a nail into it and hang your picture.
Really heavy framed pictures need to be hung by you and someone with experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Work on your pronunciation of “sh,” “k,” “t,” “p.”

“Sh” needs to be more complete and more in the front of the mouth. You are forming it in the mid-mouth and not using the lips enough.

The voiceless plosives, k (sometimes spelled c), t, and p, all have the typical Indian lack of air behind them. Hold a piece of paper in front of your mouth and pronounce the below words, making sure that you produce enough air to make the paper move. For American English, it’s most important that the first consonant in these words produces this effect. In Ireland, it should be the final plosive. This varies for other countries as well.

- cat
- cap
- pat
- tap
- tack
- pack </TEXT>

<TEXT> You have to talk about values. When you get into the specifics about a certain politician, it always gets ugly. Now, I agree with you that Trump is a pox on this nation. But I have known many Trump supporters who are basically good people. It mystifies me that good people can be pro-Trump, but there it is.

Ask your dad what he feels are the top three issues this country is facing. What does he think needs to be done about them? Listen without interrupting. Look to see where you have the same values. Then ask him if he’d like to know what your top three issues are. See if you can word them in a way that he can relate to.

Let’s say he has a problem with illegal immigration. Maybe at the root of that is his desire for economic security. Maybe he is convinced that too many American jobs are being taken by undocumented foreigners.

And let’s say you have huge concerns about the environment. If you mention global warming, you might lose him. However, if you word it differently, you’ll get a better result. You could say, “The reason I put the environment in my top three is that I want to make sure we have a livable planet for my children and grandchildren.” The commitment there is environmental security.

You take economic security and environmental security and what do they have in common? You and he both want a good future for your family and descendants.

The key is to find this commonality with each
of your three concerns and each of his three concerns. It takes work, but it is possible, even with polarizing issues.

Doing this probably won’t change his mind on anything, but it will hopefully bring you some peace when you can agree on some of your values. And it may make it easier for you both to talk about your political concerns in a non-confrontational way. </TEXT>

<TEXT> OK. That info is very helpful. Here are some suggestions.

Do a TON of informational interviews. This is a no-cost way of getting valuable information from people who have tried and failed, then tried and succeeded at the same things you want to do. First, watch several YouTube videos on the topic. Say for example your topic is “When should I travel to Japan?” Or “Best Asian Countries for Westerners” or “How to Make Money in China.” Whatever the thing is, the videos will help you to be able to skip the boneheaded questions and figure out what kinds of specific questions you’ll want to ask. Let’s say your question is whether it would be possible to get a temporary job in Asia as a 21-year-old who is a Python expert. After you watch related videos, then you type up five questions, and you post them in a relevant subreddit, as well as in other social media. There you’ll have some interactions with people who are full of information, and you’ll ask some if they would be willing to discuss it further with you. Find out what medium they prefer and use that. Chat, text, phone, email, or live video.

Repeat this process with all areas of your goals that you need input on.

As for your plan, I suggest you make a very loose plan, because things change so rapidly,  there are a lot of unknowns, and you are open to different ways of achieving the lifestyle you want. Then for the current year make a detailed plan. It’s more important to focus on the goals of the plan than on the how. It’s impossible to know right now the details of how you’re going to do something four years from now. Having specific goals in mind will draw your attention to people, ideas, technology, and methods that will help you achieve them.

While you’re in high school, the main thing to be doing is gathering information. Reading, watching videos, and interviewing. But there are three other things that you can do as well.

- Learn marketable skills for free online.

- Study one or two widely-spoken foreign languages, such as Spanish and Chinese.

- Try starting a small business or two. See it as an experiment. Don’t invest much money if any. Focus more on learning than on earning. </TEXT>

People also use the negative assumption as a means of manipulation or dominance.

<TEXT> I think they sound odd because they are so vague and I don’t have the context. Another possible reason is that we are more likely to say *this matter* or *that matter* than *the matter*.

Therefore, the issue at hand has been identified and should be referred to in a more specific way than with the word *the.* </TEXT>

<TEXT> Grammatically, they are both acceptable. They both sound odd, however. I’m not clear why you are topicalizing the matter in any of the above sentences. Normally the sentence structure would be, “I asked whether it was right for us to help them with the case.”

If you’re doing an assignment in which you are to practice topicalization, I would hope you’d be guided toward more natural-sounding topic sentences. Here are some examples.

Well, I love ravioli. And as for lasagna, my friend here has never tried it.

Speaking of lunch, do you have plans?

About that report: is it almost done?

About missing the meeting yesterday, I didn’t come to work at all, because I wasn’t feeling well.

<TEXT> Try to remember to go pee in the airport restroom just before you board the plane. It’s so much easier than using the cramped lavatory in the airplane. During a six-hour flight you might have to use it once but that’s much better than two or three times.

Also, be prepared for chimes during flight that you don’t understand. I hate them because one of the most common ones sounds like “Uh-oh.” And then the flight attendants smile and ignore it, while you’re thinking, “Wait! What was that?!? What did that chime mean? Is everything okay?”

When they serve beverages, be aware that it might take 45 minutes for them to serve everyone. It looks like your turn will be in just a couple of minutes and then you wait and wait for what seems like forever. Try to ignore them and do something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Then the flight attendant will take your bag and have it stowed in the lower part of the plane. If that happens make sure to take out the things you’ll need during the flight, as well as your toothbrush, a pair of underwear, and any documents/valuables. For this reason it’s a good idea to bring a mostly empty small backpack or other satchel along.
When your plane lands at your destination, your bag will be returned to you there at the gate. It isn’t usually sent all the way to baggage claim. But suitcases do get lost sometimes, which is why I mentioned the underwear. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Reaganomics caused a sea change in the stratification of American society. It led to a wider gap between the rich and the poor, and it began the shrinking of the middle class. The tax rate for hugely rich Americans went down.

<TEXT> Like any good hypothetical scenario, the answer is: “it depends.” Think about what you’d be looking for if you asked an applicant this question. Here are some possible questions behind the question.

Will the applicant:

- put helping someone ahead of academic obligations?
- put academic obligations above helping a person in need?
- be too exacting and say there are not enough details to be able to answer the question?
- minimize the question and give an answer that’s too short?
- give an answer that’s indecisive?
- be intentional and convincing by giving a balanced answer of moderate length and with realistic hypothetical details or an example from personal experience, thus demonstrating careful thought?

etc. It’s a way for them to judge your character and integrity. </TEXT>

One of the big challenges I’ve had living in my car in the time of COVID is finding places to shower. All the gyms around here have closed their showers. So I’ve showered at friends’ houses, used baby wipes to clean my body, and sometimes I find a great deal for a room on AirBnB and I get a shower that way.

Another tip is to organize your stuff really, really well in your vehicle. It will make a huge difference in your ability to function. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Let me share an anecdote. I have been homeless for about six weeks. About two months ago, I applied for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because I was unemployed. I started getting enough food money from the state to pay for all of the food that my daughter and I needed.

Then I became homeless. My daughter went to stay with her dad. I needed temporary money to keep up with my bills, so I applied for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. When I got the phone call from the worker to determine if I was eligible, I explained that I was homeless, and she asked if my daughter was with me. I said no.

She said, “I would have denied your application anyway, because you earn more than $499 per month (from odd jobs), but because your daughter isn’t living with you, I’m going to have to deny it for that reason. And I have to cut your food money by 40%.”

If anyone tells you it’s easy to qualify for welfare benefits, they have never been a recipient. </TEXT>

In some high schools, part of the curriculum requires students to participate in community work such as helping elderly people and THE disabled. In what way DO children benefit from this? Do you think it should be the part of THE curriculum?

"Many schools nowadays incorporate community work in there THEIR curriculum among other subjects. It helps students to learn important values that most [of] (NO OF) youngsters are missing today. I think every school should make it mandatory to have that extra yet beneficial activity included in the school curriculUM.

As (NO AS) in the modern world, THE majority of schools' authorities mainly focus on teaching THE latest technology education, due to the fact that computerS hasVE become part and parcel of both professional and personal life. This, in truth (NO IN TRUTH) leads to loseING crucial and fundamental values such as empathy and social behaviour. Therefore, doing public work at school time (WHILE IN SCHOOL) can help gaining such values as students work among elders and be aware of the suffering and incapabilities of abnormal (NO ABNORMAL) people.

Furthermore, community work could also help students with their studies, for instance, a medical student can have knowledge working in a public hospital along with studying in school. Thus, having such information treating in A public hospital will give the student a head-start in HIS/HER career as compared to their peers who did not take PART in such activity during THEIR schoolING. Moreover, some students have social incapabilities, they cannot perform socially well. In regard to this, when working among other people, they will learn social skills that are important to have a successful career.

Overall, as youngsters today lack basic social values because of the lack of teaching about them in school's (NO APOSTROPHE), community work CAN definitely bridge that gap, teaching such skills and avoid social inhibitions of some students that (NO THEY) DEVELOP OTHERWISE (NOT grow innately)."

<TEXT> I can articulate it though, because I am a native speaker of English, multilingual, a linguist and dialectician, and I have a masters degree in adult education. So here goes.

Syllabic emphasis: it’s very difficult as a non-native speaker of English to always know which syllables get the emphasis in a given word or phrase. At times you have it perfect, but not consistently enough. Examples of words/phrases that need different emphasis are: I have, check my gear, keep it all in.

Tone and timbre: your modulation of frequency with respect to the music of American English speech is not native-like. What I mean is that your voice sometimes sounds older than you actually are or younger than you actually are because of how high or low you’re pitching it.

Subtle pronunciation differences: bizarre sounded like bzar, skillfully sounded like skoofully.

At the same time, there are many pronunciations in this passage that you produce in a much more native-like manner than most foreigners do. </TEXT>

Line 2: Does that mean your remembrance and your denial, or your remembrance and my denial?

Line 1 and 3: Do you like the cadence better of “in between” or simply “between?”

Line 4: Does “my fragrance” mean my natural scent, or does it mean perfume?

Line 8: Curious about why you use a question mark instead of a period.

Lastly, I wonder if you’re familiar with the poet Rupi Kaur? Your poetry is similar to hers. </TEXT>

PREJUDICE

A pre-judgment or unjustifiable, and usually negative, attitude of one type of individual or groups toward another group and its members. Such negative attitudes are typically based on unsupported generalizations (or stereotypes) that deny the right of individual members of certain groups to be recognized and treated as individuals with individual characteristics.

MODEL MINORITY

A term created by sociologist William Peterson to describe the Japanese community, whom he saw as being able to overcome oppression because of their cultural values.

While individuals employing the Model Minority trope may think they are being complimentary, in fact the term is related to colorism and its root, anti-Blackness. The model minority myth creates an understanding of ethnic groups, including Asian Americans, as a monolith, or as a mass whose parts cannot be distinguished from each other. The model minority myth can be understood as a tool that white supremacy uses to pit people of color against each other in order to protect its status.

<TEXT> The topic for today is: the furthest away from home you have ever been.

The furthest away from home I have ever been is the U.S., which is where I have been living for nearly seven years. I first arrived in the U.S. on December 27th, 2013. I traveled alone from Beijing to Chicago. I was aimless when I got off the airplane. But I had to do everything all by myself. So I decided to get my tickets for the next flights, to St.Louis and then from St. Louis to Kirksville (state?)

I took a small airplane; it was so small that even now I still remember it was called “Cape Air.” It only took around 10 people, including the captain. When I got off the airplane, my impression of Kirksville was that it was very dark and cold. There was some snow on the ground. There was a lady called Mary there to meet me; she is still my Facebook friend today. She took me to my first homestay. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This question has been asked here before and also on r/askreddit. Try searching for those posts.

The answer is that we all have a mixture of cognition patterns, some of which include language and some of which do not. Sign language works the same way, cognitively, as spoken language. So just as you probably go back and forth between images and English words, a deaf American would do the same with images, ASL, and English words. A deaf person from another country who is not literate, say Colombia, for example, would not include much written Spanish in that mixture, if any. </TEXT>

3. I especially struggle with articulating my ideas / communicating them

**Maybe, maybe not. If so, you can improve with feedback and practice.**

4. I don’t like the feeling of being judged

**Nobody does! Take a speech class or go to Toastmasters.**

<TEXT> It is highly dependent on the culture and subcultures in which you live and socialize. For example, in Japan, women are not supposed to let their teeth show when they laugh. There, women can wear very short skirts, but it’s inappropriate to wear sleeveless tops.

In some subcultures in the U.S., women do not wear pants. Only skirts and dresses.

In the white American culture in which I grew up, which is considered by most of its women to be a relatively egalitarian one, women are expected to be polite, not loud, and non-egoistic. Thus, when we watch women performing flamenco dance, we sometimes find it overly bold.

<TEXT> Be prepared for it to be enjoyable or not enjoyable. After all the hype, the first time can often be disappointing. Don’t let it get to you if it’s not as good as you hoped. A lot of people are just glad to put their virginity behind them.
It’s really the start of a long season of sexual expression, during which you’ll go through many stages. All you have to do at this point is be consistent about preventing pregnancy and STDs. Then the next step is learning what you like and don’t like. And then learning what your partner(s) like and don’t like. And so on.
Try to encourage your partner not to have unrealistic expectations too. Try to be chill, have a sense of humor, and all that. But if you get emotional, that’s okay too. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I can relate! I have gotten this feedback too. I recommend recording yourself talking to two or three other people (with permission of course) and then listen to it later. You’ll be able to hear things you aren’t normally able to      hear, especially relating to tone.

Also, watch out for these habits:

- Trying to impress people with your skills/knowledge. To some of us it’s just normal to do that but to other people it comes off as pompous.
- Asking unnecessary questions. I like to ask lots of questions. The problem is that sometimes it can make people feel doubted, or attacked. Try not to ask as many questions as usual.
- Making comparisons. Again, this is something that some of us do innocently, but it can sound rather superior.
- Saying “me too.” This causes problems if you do it too often.
- Sharing your opinion without being asked. Like the above behaviors, it’s just a habit, but it can ruffle people’s feathers. </TEXT>

<TEXT> It is my understanding that every human with intelligence has an internal monologue. Sometimes it has language attached to it and sometimes it doesn’t. All of us, no matter what language(s) we use, can have internal monologue that is based on concepts and images, or on words. It seems likely that we switch regularly from one to the other. And since signs are cognitively equivalent to words, it would be the same for deaf people. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not anymore it isn’t. But I applied in 1992. At that time freshmen already had to have an A average to be considered. I was applying as a junior though, and juniors generally only had to have a 3.7. I had a 3.69 and multiple additional qualifications. I wasn’t terribly surprised that I wasn’t admitted. I did appeal, and that didn’t work.
Another relevant note: my grandfather transferred into UC Berkeley in 1937 as a third-year after having attended a California junior college. He became a professor there, then a dean, and finally the Vice President of the UC system. It didn’t matter that I carried his surname, and that is as it should be.
So I went to Mills College instead. Smaller classes, less stress. </TEXT>

In the intervening years (1964-1992), Berkeley had become more and more popular with international students, and the locals had a lot more competition. It didn’t help that California natives pay a lot less in tuition. The university had an incentive to admit more out-of-state applicants. </TEXT>

Put together a list of these sources and show them to your parents, explaining that this is the beginning of your journey.
I recommend that you continue this journey, learning about all of the major religions of the world, as well as other institutions and systems by which people determine their values and their personal truth.

Here are some videos that I recommend, just to get you started.

<TEXT> I should have said that your original comment was incomplete, as well as confusingly ungrammatical. More details should be included about the various West-Germanic tribes that settled in England and contributed to the birth of the English language. Saying that Dutch sailors visited the British Isles is an over-simplification of the history.

<TEXT> Re: teaching in a college. You have an advantage, assuming that you have some kind of RP-like British accent. People who sound like that are favored in academic hiring in the U.S.
The big challenge when it comes to teaching at a college is that most colleges and universities have moved to... almost a gig-like model. They hire twice as many part-time instructors as they used to, and to make a living, most instructors have to rush about from one college to another, just to earn a decent amount. Full-time openings are scarce and the colleges get inundated with applications. So I’d recommend you do your research on that early, and find out how competitive it is to be hired to teach in your discipline.
Find out if the town(s) you’re considering have any openings.
Just as important: research the weather in the region(s) you’re considering. Some Midwest states where homes are affordable have hot and humid summers and miserably cold winters with regular dumpings of snow and coatings of ice.
As long as you know what you’re in for... check to see if you can satisfy your personal wishes. You’d hate to move somewhere only to find that none of your hobbies are viable to pursue there. </TEXT>

And it’s actually good you’re not 18 yet because you’ll need the next couple of years to save up some money, and for the state of the world (Covid) to settle back down. Just know that you should start the process of getting a passport several months before your first trip. It can take a while to get one. Also, learn about visas. In case you’re not familiar with visas, they are documents you get because many countries require you to get their approval before you travel there. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When I was in college I had very little money, and I wanted to study abroad. What I did was create a summer trip for myself that allowed me to go to two short programs in Ireland where I learned about music, the Irish language, and other cultural themes. I amazed myself by putting together a very good itinerary, and it was pretty affordable.
If because of covid, or costs, or whatever other reason you aren’t able to travel abroad within the next year or so, consider doing a volunteer job through the Student Conservation Association. I did that two summers later and got to be a National Park ranger in a state I’d never been to. Great experience. </TEXT>

For example: I’m praying with the others right now even though I don’t believe all of the rules of religion, because it’s part of being safe. I need to keep myself safe so that I can make it to the future, where some young person will see me being my true self, and by doing so I will be a role model.

"The way you behave is ridiculous" CORRECT

"The way you behave yourself is ridiculous"
INCORRECT

Can I use "yourself" sometimes to emphasize a verb?

Yes. When *behave* is used in an imperative sentence, it can take any of the three below forms:

- *Behave.* (a command)
- *Behave yourself.* (the same command)
-  Behave + adverb (imperative with specific instructions) for example, “Behave appropriately.”

As imperatives, these can all be written with an exclamation mark or a period/full stop.

There are other verbs that can optionally include *yourself,* such as:

- sit (yourself down)
- take care (of yourself)

And there are verb phrases that must always include *yourself.”

- suit yourself (it’s up to you)
- be yourself (be authentic)
- hurt yourself (don’t hurt yourself!) </TEXT>

<TEXT> Not at all. There are scads of concepts that are easy to convey in sign language even though they pertain to sound, and the idea of “you’re welcome” has nothing inherent about it that would be difficult for deaf people.
It’s simply an expression that isn’t used, much like “Have a nice day,” which is absent from many societies.

<TEXT> Just be there and make yourself accept whatever is happening. Like for example, if your friend is crying, and you feel uncomfortable because it saddens you to see your friends crying, tell yourself: “It’s okay that my friend is crying. That’s what allows the feelings to be processed.”

Instead of telling your friends things in order to make them feel better, try saying things that will help them know that you know how they feel. Not that you feel it, but that you see and hear what’s going on. Be affirming. For example, “Wow, that’s heavy. I can tell that this is bothering you a lot, and I can’t blame you. I think anyone would be upset by this.”

If the friend seems to want to interact, try asking questions such as “What would be most helpful to you right now? Would it be best if I sit here and listen, or would you like me to distract you from what’s been on your mind by telling you unrelated stories? I could tell you any type of story, you choose.”

Another option would be to say, “What kinds of things have people done for you when you’ve felt like this in the past that you liked? I could put on some music for you, or make you an ice cream sundae, or rub your back, or we could draw pictures.” (whatever is appropriate given your relationship of course). </TEXT>

<TEXT> You sound 80% like an American. I can hear your German accent, but that’s partly because I’ve known many Germans and I speak some German. Your vowels are pretty good — I’d say you’re at 90% with those. The consonants need a little more work if you want to pass for American. For example, when you said “raised,” it sounded like “raced.”

There are times when you say an entire sentence without any trace of a German accent and other times when several words in a row sound accented. It just depends on what vowel sounds and what consonant sounds occur in the sentence.

One thing that affects your overall sound is how closed your mouth is. Try playing with this by imagining you’re really sleepy or drunk. If you’ve never been drunk then try copying the way teenagers sound on those videos where they’re waking up from anesthesia. I’m not saying that Americans sound like that; I just think it would be a good exercise to relax and open your mouth a bit which will in turn lead to sounding a bit more American.

Lastly, try copying various American accents as a way of playing with the sounds. I recommend using this video of Fred Armisen: https://youtu.be/G72tZdjnS2A </TEXT>

- If you are in a bad mood, people aren’t going to blame it on your gender.
- You can be a careless driver and not have people blame it on your gender/race.
- You can be confident that your coworkers won’t assume you were hired because of your gender/race.
- You can expect to be paid equitably for the work you do and not paid less because of your gender.
- If you are unable to succeed in your career, that won’t be seen as evidence against your gender/race in the workplace.
- You can generally travel, or walk down a public street, without the fear of police harassment.
- You can generally walk alone at night without the fear of being raped or otherwise harmed.
- You can dress how you want and not worry it will be used as a defense if you are raped.
- You can decide not to have children and not have your masculinity questioned.
- If you choose to have children, you will be praised for caring for your children instead of being expected to be the full-time caregiver.
- If you get a promotion, no one will assume it is because of your race/gender.
- You can seek political office without having your race or your gender be a part of your platform.
- Most political representatives share your race and gender, particularly the higher-ups.
- Your political officials fight for issues that pertain to your race/gender, or at least don’t dismiss your issues as “special interest.” </TEXT>

<TEXT> The people who feel the most stress from being in debt are those who have high interest rates and insufficient income. They truly have no idea how or when they might be able to make progress toward paying down those debts. If a person has, for example, a credit card that charges 18% interest, and it’s maxed out at $10,000, and that person is unemployed or earning minimum wage, then the interest is probably growing faster than the principal can be paid down. That person will typically feel a lot of regret for having maxed out the card.

People who give advice on money matters explain that unless you have a terrific credit score and very reliable income, you can’t be sure that this won’t happen to you. Therefore, they say, the best plan is not to accumulate debt in the first place. But for many of us, it’s too late, or debt is impossible to avoid.

I’m kind of in this boat. I’m unemployed and I have three credit cards, two of which are nearly maxed out. I have done some balance transfers, so I temporarily have a 0% interest rate, but I have to find employment soon or risk going further into debt. It is indeed stressful.

On the other hand, I once had nearly $50,000 in student loan debt, and I paid it all off. So I know I can get past my current $20,000 worth of debt. It’s just a matter of time and effort. Having done it once, I know I can do it again, so that alleviates the stress somewhat. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Just as with spoken languages, signed languages have dialects, regional lexical variations, and to some extent they have accents. Just like with speech, signers are faster in New York and slower in Texas. There are significantly different dialects in Hawaii, Louisiana, and a few other places. There are differences between how men sign and how women sign, and between how children, adolescents, and adults sign. And other variations. </TEXT>

All are acceptable. They are a little out of date; young people don’t typically use these expressions. Mostly you hear them in music or see them in literature from the 1940s/50s/50s.

You could post three sentences and ask people to tell you which one(s) seem most natural, and why. Then ask follow-up questions. Or, come up with your own alternative way of asking what you want to know.

To me, both sentences are acceptable as written. The second is a little awkward. I would word it differently, but then it might not answer your question.

He had been saying that the moment I turned 18 I’d be on my own, which meant moving in the middle of my last term in high school map I decided to get a jump on it and moved out during the summer after my junior year. I moved in with a 29-year-old. Oh, my dad was fine with it. He was the one who introduced us. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Because these are your parents, I challenge you to take on radical acceptance. By that I don’t mean that you approve of the things they’re saying — not at all. Radical acceptance is different. It’s what allows the Dalai Lama to laugh. It’s what lets people forgive even when no one apologized. And it may be the only way that you can find peace.

Protestors are protesting, and looters are looting. The only connection is that large protests unfortunately create opportunities for thieves. People who don’t look past the surface are associating looters with protestors, and that’s a false correlation. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Ask him why he feels so strongly about this. Did something happen? Ask him if he knows anyone who’s LGBTQ. He probably doesn’t, at least not very well. This is the case for most homophobic people. They think that no one they know is gay. They need to find out that several people they know and respect are queer. That doesn’t mean you have to come out to him; but start learning the names of all kinds of people who were/are queer that he is likely to respect. There’s no shortage. Start looking in Wikipedia and the like. Appeal to his interests: Christianity, farming, sports, whatever it takes. The goal is to help him to realize that gay people are normal people and many of them have the same values he has. Here are some religious leaders who support accepting gay people as they are: Bishop Desmond Tutu, the current pope, Clackamas United Methodist Church pastor in Oregon, etc. Google them to find quotes if you think they’d help.

Tell him why he’s your favorite uncle and why you admire him. Show respect for his faith. You don’t have to be a Christian in order to respect the
great Christian principles. I myself am a bisexual agnostic with pagan and Buddhist leanings, and I find much value in the teachings of Jesus. Learn some bible verses that you can embrace as part of your canon of truth. Let him know that his hatred for people who were born a certain way is doing damage to your relationship with him (in words that won’t make him think you’re being weird and mushy or playing junior psychoanalyst on him). Let him know that it’s important to you not to lose your connection with him.

Good luck. You are doing the right thing by trying. It may take a long time. Remember that success is not defined by trying once. Success is being able to go from failure to failure to failure to success, never having lost your commitment along the way. And the commitment here is worthy: it is to family, respect, dignity, harmony, and integrity. </TEXT>

<TEXT> How to choose your __dream__ career

__Making__ a bad decision could waste your money and, above all, your time. But don’t worry: __follow this__ simple advice and you won’t regret your choice.

First of all you should __find what is the__ (rephrase) job you will enjoy the most. Do you want to be an engineer? A doctor? A zoo-keeper? An actor? A lawyer? This is the right time to make your decision. Remember that a job represents a __large portion__ of your life and (removed) it __will__ affect your future lifestyle __as__ every career __fits__ into a different one. So you should ask yourself if you want to work far from home or close to __home__, if you want to work traveling all around the world or staying in an office, if you want to work by yourself or with (removed) co-workers.

After you have found the __job you will like__ (rephrase), the next thing to do is __seek__ advice to start your career properly: there are many forums on the __web__ which __can__ provide you the __information__ you need, but the best source is __a professional__. He could explain __to__ you the way he built his career and show you the benefits and the disadvantages of such a job.

__After you have completed the above steps,__ you should apply __to__ the universities or the schools that will give you the knowledge your future career __requires__. A lot of schools organize __open house events, when you can__ visit and meet your future __professors__. Don’t waste __these__ opportunities!

Choosing your future career is a big __project that takes time and effort,__ but it is the only way to become __an__ adult. </TEXT>

<TEXT> When greens, such as lettuce, bok choy, spinach,
etc., get too much sun, they stop putting their energy into growing leaves and instead put it into creating stems, flowers and seeds. It’s called bolting, or going to seed. Some greens start to taste bitter at this point so they should be pulled up right away. If they taste okay then use the last leaves before throwing the rest in the compost or saving the seeds.

To prevent or stave off bolting, plant your greens in a slightly shaded spot, or in a container that can be moved as needed. Another approach is to sow seeds or transplant starts at the right time of year to avoid the hottest days. Then there’s the strategy of shopping online for varieties that are considered slow to bolt or heat-tolerant. Keep them adequately watered, and learn which plants should be pruned and how to do it by watching videos on YouTube.

Two YouTubers I recommend for you are linked below, with videos that are quite relevant to this discussion.

<TEXT> No, there is no signed language that has a sign-to-word match for every concept that is expressed in that particular society. The most commonly-used functional words (*you, here, tomorrow*) and day-to-day items do typically have signs. For example, American Sign Language has signs for *milk, bread, apple,* and other common items, but not for *parsley, mustard,* or *cauliflower.* We can safely assume that every signed language has signs for *mother, home,* and *sleep,* but we can also safely assume that few if any signed languages have established, standardized signs for *quasar, chloroplast,* or *paleontology.* Since each signed language exists within a society whose dominant group uses a spoken and typically written language, deaf people who complete enough education that they would need words such as these are by definition literate and therefore they simply use the words that already exist in the spoken/written language of their home country. </TEXT>

*She takes good care of herself* can mean she’s in good shape physically, and attractive.

*Taking care of business* is a vague expression that essentially means to work or to do the thing, whatever that thing is that needs to be done. *Take care of* cannot be replaced by *look after* in this case. In colloquial American English, to take care of it or him can mean to fix it; to get rid of it or him, and often in films like gangster movies, that means to kill him. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The body does what it does when it comes to hair and there’s very little that you can do to influence its growth. When you trim your pubic hair you feel like it’s coming back thicker because the ends are blunt from having been cut, and that’s what really makes you notice how thick pubic hairs are. I suggest that to trim your pubic hair, you use a comb to protect your skin and to lift up the hair, and a trimmer such as Norelco or Wahl to do the cutting. You’ll get much better results this way.
You might also look into getting laser hair removal done. I had my bikini line and my underarms done and I’ve been very happy with the results. (Note that laser really only works well on dark hair). </TEXT>

- How can I send him wedding congratulations?

- How can I send him a wedding congratulations message?

It’s almost always *congratulations* with the ‘s.’ The only time it doesn’t have the ‘s’ is when we’re describing the action or the message rather than actually delivering it.

*a hearty handshake in congratulation*

*a bouquet as a token of congratulation*

- __The__ children’s dirty __fingerprints__ won't come off the wall.

Can we change "get off" and "come off" to "get out" and come out"?

__No, but you can use “get out” and “come out” when you’re talking about something on a carpet/rug/blanket/drapes/pillow.__

*I’ve tried everything on that rug, but I can’t get the grape juice to come out!*

I think in the first we can use the verb "remove" Instead of the phrasal verb but what about the second one?

__You could say *I can’t remove the children’s dirty fingerprints from the wall,* but it would sound too formal. This utterance would normally be spoken by one family member to another. Perhaps if it were a fancy home and the housekeeper were saying it to the lady of the house, then it would fit.__

“Remove” won’t work in the second one without it sounding odd. </TEXT>

<TEXT> The person who wrote the sentence was using the verb “to prove” in a different sense than we normally do. The meaning it carried in the sentence you quoted was (informally) “has turned out to be.” If you replace “has proven” with “has turned out to be” then it works for the next word to be “incapable.”
This meaning for “has proven” is much less common than the one you were thinking of, but it is used in more formal speech. Here are some examples:

*The culinary students’ first attempts at tarts have proven quite edible.*

*Despite an unwavering commitment, her efforts to convince the board of its error proved fruitless.* </TEXT>

2) Is "the make/makes of" a valid phrase? Can I say "global warming is the make of human beings"?

No. We might say “global warming was created/caused by human beings,” or “war is the creation of human beings.”

The word *make* (as a noun) refers to the brand name of a car or truck. Examples: Ford, Honda, Volvo.

I’m not sure how you mean to use “makes of,” but there are some valid uses of that phrase. All I can think of though is that in those cases, “makes” is a verb, or a vehicle brand. </TEXT>

I recommend you write a very heartfelt yet direct letter (handwritten!) saying that you are sad you have to stop spending time around her, but that you have to take care of yourself and contact with her has not been good for your mental and emotional well-being. Don’t wait for a reply or expect any kind of positive response. And don’t negotiate or allow her or anyone else to shame or blame you.
At times you will question your decision, but the rest of the time you will know for sure that you did the right thing. And no one else has the right to tell you it was wrong. It’s for you to decide.
Once you’ve sent her that letter, don’t look back. She might change in the future, or she might not. You have spent enough time and energy on her. Go and make friends out of strangers, and family out of friends. People who appreciate your company are the only ones who deserve to have it. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Some books/online lessons/study systems have the words written out in romaji (western alphabet), and unless you’re a 100% auditory learner, that would be the way to go. At least to start. Just know that a lot of Japanese people won’t take you seriously as a learner of the language if you can’t read anything in Japanese. They put a lot more emphasis on reading and writing than on speaking and listening when they study English, so they often don’t understand why some foreigners don’t even learn the basic hiragana syllabary.

The bottom line is that you can learn some very basic conversation without learning any of the Japanese writing systems, but you won’t be able to go far beyond that unless you’re a gifted auditory learner. </TEXT>

<TEXT> “The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has rejected an ultimatum by South Dakota's governor to remove checkpoints on state highways within tribal reservations or risk legal action.

Gov. Kristi Noem sent letters Friday to the leaders of both the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe demanding that checkpoints designed to prevent the spread of coronavirus on tribal land be removed, the governor's office said in a statement.”

<TITLE> Goobers/goober peas </TITLE>
<DATE> 2020-05-05 00:23:55 </DATE>
<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I have three questions about the word goober, meaning peanut.

1. Is it commonly accepted among linguists that the word (*guba*) originated in Bantu languages in Africa and was subsequently used in this country by enslaved people?

2. Does the average American know that the word goober can mean peanut? (I’m not going into other possible definitions here).

3. If not the average American, would it be fair to say that most Americans in the south are familiar with this word-meaning pair? How commonly is it still used?

Note: According to Google’s Ngram viewer, the term *goober peas* has been relatively constant over the years, while the term *goober* has appeared more and more over time, presumably based on other meanings, such as “goofball.” </TEXT>

<TEXT> A judge just ruled against the US Women’s Soccer Team in their claim that they should be paid more. My understanding is that their base pay is actually a bit more than that of the men’s team, but they take home less because the men’s team gets more in advertising money due to having more spectators. Is this correct or am I missing something? </TEXT>

<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
<TEXT> I just found out that it’s ridiculously easy to blanch almonds. All you do is boil them for one minute, drain, rinse in cold water, then pop them out of their skins one by one.
Knowing this makes a big difference for me because I love almonds but I’m sensitive to the tannins in the skins. I tried it today and it was easy-peasy. </TEXT>
